kub4o0|qv5cg4|qv5cg4|5|There's a massive anti-options reaction to Criand's DD, without explanation of the path of margin account, more patient gains, executing level 1 and level 2 in safer circumstances, before attempting to make a judgement of, let alone execute level 2 with the nuanced wisdom Criand suggests, for a volatile stock like GME.  If you just learned to stand, then try to sprint while jumping over hurdles, you're going to immediately fall flat on your face, and it'll hurt. But, don't be afraid of learning to walk. Don't be blindly afraid of "margin" and "options". These are good things to learn about and use, if you're wise and patient with your progress.  I'm not saying this is what WSB should be about. But, if we're not teaching *that* here, maybe drop some breadcrumbs. Apes are stronger the more of us have more wrinkles.  Edit: One doesn't technically need margin to use options, as clarified below. As I understand it, it's the traditional path, and I followed it.|2021-11-16 05:29:11

kvgjs7|qv5cg4|qv5cg4|6|&#x200B;  Republicans are introducing a bill to legalize weed  [https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-cannabis-federal-legalization-bill-2021-11?utm\_source=reddit.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-cannabis-federal-legalization-bill-2021-11?utm_source=reddit.com)  (see r/WeedStocks for more info)  Summary as behind paywall:  A lot of the rules around cannabis would look like alcohol regulations:        One of the key components of the bill is to make the regulation of cannabis look and feel like alcohol in the US. The bill would set 21 as the minimum age nationwide ‚Äî excluding some medical products ‚Äî for cannabis use.        The Treasury Department's Tax and Trade Bureau would be the primary regulator of cannabis, as it is for alcohol. The Food and Drug Administration, which doesn't have a large role in regulating alcohol, would only have jurisdiction over medical cannabis products.        The US Department of Agriculture would treat cannabis as an agricultural crop, much like hemp, or barley and hops.                2. Interstate commerce would be allowed under the bill, with a permit        If the bill passed, the secretary of the Treasury would craft the details around interstate commerce, and other regulations, and would be responsible for developing a track-and-trace system for interstate commerce to monitor cannabis products from production to sale.        Cannabis products in interstate commerce would be treated in the same way as alcohol. Those looking to participate would need a permit issued by the secretary and would have to abide by each state's cannabis laws.        Thirty days after the bill is passed, individuals would be allowed to request permission to introduce a medical cannabis product for interstate commerce.                3. The bill proposes some social equity provisions        The States Reform Act would expunge nonviolent cannabis crimes, except for those related to driving under the influence or foreign drug cartels.        Within 14 days of the bill's passing, any pending criminal charges, cases, or convictions related to non-violent cannabis crimes would be dropped and anyone incarcerated for nonviolent cannabis crimes would be released.        The bill would also ensure that the Small Business Administration treats cannabis companies as legal businesses. Under the bill, cannabis businesses would be allowed to apply for and receive loans, like any other business.        Unlike the Democratic-led Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, the States Reform Act wouldn't focus tax revenue specifically on communities most impacted by the war on drugs.                4. Cannabis would have a federal excise tax of 3% and revenue would go to several different programs        The bill establishes the Cannabis Revenue Act, which would place a 3% federal excise tax on cannabis products in the US. This rate applies also to cannabis products imported into the United States from other countries.        The 3% tax is expected to bring in $4 billion in tax revenues over the next 10 years, according to a spokesperson for Mace's office.        The 3% rate wouldn't increase for 10 years once the bill is passed, unless a vote passes three-fourths in both the House and Senate.        Tax revenue from cannabis sales would go to a new fund called the "Law Enforcement Retraining and Successful Second Chances Fund," which would support programs around mental health services for formerly incarcerated individuals and veterans, opioid addiction, small businesses, and community policing.        Congress would be tasked with deciding how much of the total tax revenue will be deposited into the fund.|2021-11-16 11:02:31

kv3i9t|qv5cg4|qv5cg4|5|prediction time  Within the next year (or maaaybe 2), RIVN, LCID and TSLA will all drop substantially. For LCID and RIVN, likely a 50% - 70% drop from ATH. TSLA will likely drop 30% - 40% from a recent high.  CNBC will be pushing a narrative about an "EV Bubble popping," and that narrative will run rampant.  LCID and RIVN \*never\* recover to that ATH. It will take TSLA between 4 months and a year to recover back to ATH, as it will continue to climb throughout the rest of the decade.  √† la AMZN and other "internet companies" that died  !RemindMe 1 year|2021-11-16 09:35:43

That is expected to surpass the $10 billion mark by the end of the company's fiscal year in January, representing a fivefold increase in four years.  It‚Äôs simple. NVDA and AMD leaps.

The company's surging subscriber growth is certainly impressive and a good reason for investors to be optimistic about the company's long-term potential.
