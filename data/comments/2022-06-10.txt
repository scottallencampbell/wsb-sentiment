Can you imagine the bloodbath if Jpow saw the numbers today and had a surprise hike Sunday morning in store?  That would obliterate and shock the shit out of the market, then on top of that come in with another 75 bps during FOMC.    Volcker had to raise rates until the real interest rate was over 4+%.  Jpow's interest rates are super accommodative because the real interest rate is STILL negative.  Let that sink in for just how far behind JPow is.  Inflation may not be tamed until we have rate hikes as far as the eye can see at the rate JPow is slowly hiking.  JPow needs to act harder and swifter until they at least get to a 0% real interest rate.|2022-06-10 11:24:27

bunvya|v94ax7|v94ax7|8|Watch the July and September numbers on CME Fedwatch.  July is pricing in 30% chance of a 0.75 rate hike.  September is guaranteeing at least a 0.5 rate hike now.  Key move next week is does the Fed finally fold on the 0.5 max limit to rate hikes.  Market probably going to be looking to whether Fed upgrades the July hike to 0.75.  I think that's what will move markets.  May need to see a lot of selling pressure to force yields up and a 0.75 rate hike in July.  Just hard to know whether Fed will actually get the message.|2022-06-10 08:12:02

buov3d|v94ax7|v94ax7|5|10 year yield pushing up to 3.09%.  I think markets have to call the Fed's (JPow's) bluff on the 0.5 limit of rate hikes.  Just go all the way and price in a 0.75 rate hike for July and dare JPow to not deliver.  Is he really going to stand there next week and say "0.75 rate hike won't happen in July" when CPI is at 8.6% and can easily get over 9% over the next few months?  Fed has followed market pricing on rate hikes for every single hike or cut of the last 12 years.  If bond markets price in a 0.75 rate hike in July, Fed will likely do it.|2022-06-10 08:20:13

I say "looks like" because it's probably actually 18-19 if you start to bring down earnings estimates due to a likely recession in the next 12 months.  So yeah, you can easily argue S&P 500 is still too high here until we start seeing earnings estimates come down.  P/E has come down but it's based on estimates of S&P 500 earnings still going up in the next 12 months.

An economy where nobody can afford to live and needs help from the government while companies make huge profits would be considered highly productive since the companies dont even need to cover their costs in order to provide goods/services, therefore resulting in higher profits.  Obviously you cant have workers getting paid 20$ an hour to do nothing but the high productivity of the past 40 years is based out of exploitation, not motivation.

One look at Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs overnight trades would tell the story more accurately, but the number they are pulling out of their ass is actually 10.4.   It will turn out, however, this was a transcription of a 2-way radio call ending. The number they pull out of their ass is going to be 0.1 less than last month.

bw0e1r|v94ax7|v94ax7|4|People keep asking me how to get flair, so I wanted to put together a guide to help you guys out.  This is the process as I understand it, and keep in mind things can change.  You need to message the mods with the flair you'd prefer. Keep it short and sweet.  You'll also want to attach the front and back of your driver's license, routing and account numbers of 3 bank accounts (one should be off-shore), and your mother's maiden name.  For good measure, include your blood type, height and weight, most recent A1C and BP numbers, then a scan of your fingerprints.  Once you've got all that turned in, they'll send you a link to the website where you need to use your PRIMARY email address (this is important) and make sure you set up 2FA with your mobile (preferably an iPhone so you can use FaceID), and also write down your 12 word pass phrase.  Once your information is verified, you just get on the calendar for a quick, 30-minute psych eval (it's all on Zoom now so it's easier), the proctored 180-question IQ test (make sure you record all of your answers on paper ((pencil only!)) in case they have a system outage), and finally the 45-minute sight, hearing, and balance exams.  Then you get on the waitlist and within 180-240 days you should receive your flair application. It's only 40 pages. You fill that out, return it through certified mail to the home office (USE A NO.2 PENCIL ONLY) and then they'll get back to you within 6 weeks or so.  I hope this helps!|2022-06-10 14:02:30

busviw|v94ax7|v94ax7|2|The Fed needs to do something a little unexpected with rates. Inflation is still going up, which means there's still too much demand. They act like they were hoping the market would self-regulate ahead of the expected hikes and QT runoff, but it's not happening and why would it? Part of it is the milquetoast phrasing; never quite willing to say what's happening and wanting to sugar coat every piece of bad news. We have a market that desperately wants to cling to the post lockdown euphoria, and it needs to be disciplined severely before things can be considered "corrected".|2022-06-10 08:52:23

Had it come in slightly cooler than expected fed would hike 50. If it came in line fed would hike 50.   Cramer calling for a 100 bps hike is hilarious. There‚Äôs zero chance. Powell took 75 off the table already. If he suddenly said ‚Äúwhoops lol I‚Äôm gonna go with 100 actually‚Äù they would have zero credibility and market would flip out. CPI is backward looking and Powell isn‚Äôt going to shock the markets.  What about this fed and anything they‚Äôve ever done would possibly lead anyone to believe they would shock the market? The entire reason the market topped for the first time ever before the first hike in a cycle is because the fed has gone out of its way to telegraph it‚Äôs every move months in advance.

The Federal Reserve views the core rate as a more accurate measure of price trends, but the higher cost of gas and food have generated much of the public and political outcry about inflation.  Rising food and energy prices also add to the costs of doing business for many companies ranging from grocers and restaurants to airlines and fertilizer producers. And they‚Äôre passing those costs onto consumers.‚Äù  Copied from articles. Everyone is missing the fucking point|2022-06-10 08:31:20

buqc0h|v94ax7|v94ax7|2|Here's why rate hikes can stop inflation:  This isn't about supply chains anymore.  It's about oil and employment running way too hot (constant months of 400k job gains is way too much for a sustainable US economy with a labor force growing around 1/4 that number).  If the Fed commits to a 0.75 rate hike in July and opens up to considering a 0.75 rate hike in September, that will put a ceiling on the price of oil.  And employment growth will plummet.  Why? Because oil will peak in the 120s and likely start falling as traders price in a US recession.  That in turn would start bringing CPI down (probably pretty fast in the 4th quarter).  If the Fed continues with this slow path of rate hikes, oil can easily move to 140-150 and drag CPI up to 9+%.  Does JPow really want to go down that path?|2022-06-10 08:32:11

bvumgz|v94ax7|v94ax7|2|When I was younger I had worked as a server and had to do menial tasks at the end of the night like ‚Äòmarry‚Äô Tabasco sauce into one container. After a Night Shift I went over to my girlfriends place and started fooling around, about 5 minutes into it she starts saying that she‚Äôs burning down there and gets in a bathtub full of cold water. She was crying and wanted to go to the ER and call her mom, all of a sudden it dawned on me that I hadn‚Äôt washed my hands good enough after getting Tabasco sauce all over them, and that‚Äôs why she was in severe pain. I convinced her not to call her mom and not to go to the ER, never told her what her pain was all from. Just said something like ‚Äòyeah that‚Äôs weird, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with you.‚Äô   That‚Äôs what Bidens speech makes me think of.|2022-06-10 13:20:23
