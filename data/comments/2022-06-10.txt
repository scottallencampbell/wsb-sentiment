8ff21z|p1m5a2|p1m5a2|4|Im hoping for a dip tomorrow with when July CPI numbers come out. After that I think it‚Äôs a safe time to take a risk on QQQ or NDX and sell a 9/10 tight 350/348 or 14500/14400 spread for around 12% gain. Even if there is no dip from CPI I think there aren‚Äôt really any market factors that will cause a big dip in tech because the next fed meeting is later in September. The only other big market factor I‚Äôm seeing right now is delta variant and that is actually good for tech cuz if the virus lasts longer then we‚Äôll have easy monetary policy for longer.|2021-08-10 11:39:42

And even when installed correctly they can go bad.  My advice? Throw them out and buy what I used to call slugs. Slugs are a bit bigger and look like big plastic screws that go in.   These work better because the pressure on the fixture comes from multiple angles as someone uses the curtian or blind.

8els41|p1m5a2|p1m5a2|1|Hi all, if you took that MRVI trade I called at $35 to $39, now would be a good time to trim about half the position ahead of earnings tonight.  Near term $50.00 plus price targets have been hit. The co. could have another great report tonight, but there could be a sell the news reaction.  Advice is, hold half for the possibility of a run to a run to $60.00. Then add back on any weakness. OF course, pay attention to the language of guidance.  I would not be selling all of this as we still have a significantly higher target.  Happy trading.  New Pick: 4XSM - But this is a longer hold as stock has to reset their AXS-05 NDA position with FDA. Short term volatility in this one. It could go anywhere from here, either to $40-$50 or $20. I would, and have been buying in small parts.  Co. has PDUFA date this August 22, but is not expected to advance until certain questions are clarified. But all indications from trial data point to minimal adjustments before the great reset and return to the runway to commercialization.|2021-08-10 08:01:32

At some point in the next two to three weeks, Ocugen should do another offering from their 100m shelf. Since their stock overreacts, it should drop to 200dma at 6. Maybe even a wick down to 4.5-5 and instant bounce. Buy as many ocgn shares as you can on this drop. Buy calls at market open (they always fuck their investors before market open) Then hold for a year and watch your money 10-20x.

For example I was checking out a particular stock (mid cap) and it had 156% short interest after missing earnings followed by a price decline. The CEO projects 1B in sales. Im interested because of the low price but should I be concerned about the high short interest? Thanks.|2021-08-10 13:55:01

I've used DigitalOcean in the past for work and they have a lot of great technical articles that I find useful so I really like the company. They do have a lot of competition from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for web hosting but those companies generally go after much bigger companies. DigitalOcean targets more small and medium-sized businesses.
