3qvklw|ty9ndg|ty9ndg|25|Looking to see what kind of strength the bounce will have. The markets basically hit their first or second support levels in terms of a continuation downward off a bear market rally.  SPY continuation 23.6% down: 447.1  SPY low yesterday: bounced anytime it went below 445 and closed at 446.52 and likely to open around 447.5 right now.  Nasdaq composite continuation 23.6% down: 13,820  Nasdaq composite low yesterday: struggled to get lower than 13,825. Briefly dipped to 13790 before popping back up, ended at 13,883.  NVDA continuation down 23.6% down: 258.8/ 38.2% down: 240  NVDA yesterday: On Tuesday we touched 258.2 before closing at 259.31. In after hours/pre-market, it went below the support and plummeted downward to open at 249.34 and slid downward to bounce around in the mid 240 range. It spiked up the hour before minutes released then fell right back down into the mid 240s before making another rally upward to 249.55 before losing steam again. It closed 244.07 and fell in after hours, but is now up in pre-market.  &#x200B;  The bounce today isn't fueled by any sort of fundamentals that I can see. It's a reaction to touching technical supports and seeing some upward movement off them. So I'll be watching technical levels to see how the markets are going to move forward in the short term. Are they sustainable? Something to build on? My gut says I doubt it. I've said that I expect the lows of the year to come in may after we hear forward guidance in earnings that is more negative than has been priced in across the board. Guidance for most companies hasn't really updated to reflect the changing landscape. So yeah, I think all the developments coming this month and the next will suppress sentiment and give us the lows in May. That means I expect weak rallies off support levels as technical traders try to make some money day/swing trading off of it.  All that to say, don't get suckered into thinking we hit a bottom. I don't see any fundamental based news coming that would reverse market wide trends. There's multiple things that can go bad, but no set up for positive news. That's not to say individual companies can't have surprise news to the upside (look at Musk at twitter as an example), but it will be the exception, not the rule. And that upside news will be fighting the current, which isn't great for making bullish plays. The idea is surprise positive news in a neutral to bullish environment so that you get maximal upside to the momentum swing.  Right now, this is a bearish environment with many risks for bearish moves, so if you see a bearish play that could net big gains, this is the environment to make that play as it has the most potential upside.|2022-04-07 05:42:22

3r0vbm|ty9ndg|ty9ndg|36|You sigh looking at pre-market charts. You've been wasting many mornings like this lately, even though you know nothing matters until 9:30. Even though you know you should do literally anything else with your time.  Suddenly, you are given something else. You turn away from your computer screens at the sound of the record player, the fizzle and pop of it starting to spin. Your wife is bent over the machine with her back to you, her red and green checkered pajamas tight against her ass. When the song starts, and Elvis begins hollering about a hound dog crying all the time, she turns to you and smiles. Before you can say a word or even smile back, she skips into the other room, then returns with the broom.  As she slides across the floor with the broom, lip syncing and laughing, and occasionally pointing the broom stick at you like a mic stand, like a weapon, like a wand, you feel like a gambler. Ready to risk it all. You're all in on this ticker, this person, with short-dated, far out of the money calls. Yes, she's flawed like everyone else, but fuck fundamentals. It doesn't have to make sense. Love never does. Let it happen. Go parabolic.  You didn't marry a 10. You married a 10 bagger.|2022-04-07 06:39:21

3sn9se|ty9ndg|ty9ndg|6|**Right, that's it.**   As a compulsive Gay-Bear, literally the only way I'm gonna make money in this market is by having two accounts with my money split evenly.  * **Account 1** i will just keep doing what I'm doing (loosing money). * **Account 2**, *"Bulltard 900"*, I will roleplay as a Bulltard. Every dip will be bought, Tessla will hit ATH before summer, SPY will reverse if we hit 420 again but most likely we will hit 500 before that, Twitter to 100, Apple should be 200 yesterday, Meta is undervalued and I'm gonna short VIX if it ever gets close to 30.  I would like to think they should cancel each other out - but the annoying truth is that Account 1 will probably be wiped out eventually, while account 2 will have fat gains.  **Is this retarded enough to actually work?**|2022-04-07 13:36:59

This morning, bought calls on the dip (or so I thought) on SOFI cause I was sure it would recover. Took losses for a few hours, got scared, sold for an $800 loss.

3r192t|ty9ndg|ty9ndg|14|Was going to ask the permabull cucks over at r/realestate but thought I‚Äôd start with my fellow poors here. All I hear is that the housing market is full of cash rich DINK couples, big earning tech bros, institutional investors. i.e -‚Äúyou can‚Äôt compete in the housing market bro, you‚Äôre punching over your weight class.‚Äù  Also I hear a lot of ‚Äúthis time it‚Äôs different. The poors, and the lowlifes with bad credit aren‚Äôt getting mortgages. Banks are being much more prudent.‚Äù  So all these rich people with lots of cash to spare with stellar credit must mean that mortgage debt should be some of the most desirable debt in the market, right? Like up there with fucking investment grade corporate bonds?   Then why the fuck does literally our ‚ÄúLender of Last Resort,‚Äù the Fed, need to hold so much of this debt?

3shful|ty9ndg|ty9ndg|2|[Scaling out and closed 1/2 of the SPX 4500/4525 CCS position, still holding TSLA 1100/1125 CCS and /NQ shorts.](https://imgur.com/a/phvh3Je) SPX line in the sand is 4450, it held yesterday and held again today intraday. Tech, semis, and communication sectors looking really weak but looks like big funds continuing to rotate into energy, consumer staples, and health care. Signs of heavy buying exhaustion but the majority of the downside move may have already happened. SPX still below daily 200 SMA and 21 EMA, market structure is neutral/bearish and currently chopping in a range. SPY likely to trade between 440 to 455 for the rest of the week. If SPY closes above ~$448 today will probably close the rest of the SPX CCS position. Theta positive positions are the way to go here.|2022-04-07 13:01:07
