wosmwp|cpavun|cpavun|23|Hey I know this is a stupid idea but I was bored over the weekend and decided to pursue this idea I had last week.  Last week I was complaining in here about losing money and how the last 20 months have been different than anything I've seen in my young life of trading. Every dip is bought and recovers remarkably fast.   I decided to break down the last 24 months of trading so here is a little spreadsheet of my findings. It's not complete yet, and as I said I know this is kinda dumb because past performance does not guarantee future blah blah   Anyway here are the [numbers](https://imgur.com/a/YJPleEA). I found it interesting we've had so many days that started red and finished red. The reason I'm posting this right now before analyzing it for more patterns is the movements today almost aligned with what I found and I find that amusing. Today, the market opened down -0.5%, climbed to a high of being down -0.35%, and then pushed down to a low of -1.00%.   If you look at the red start red finish days, you can see they start -0.41%, climb to a high of -0.39%, drop to a low of -1.16%, before closing at -0.77% on the day. I'd like to look at the median instead of average when I have more time. I find it interesting the average red open to red close is lower on the day as a whole instead of being gobbled up with idiots buying every dip possible.|2019-08-12 11:02:31

Cramer says he expects the Chinese government to bring in the People's Liberation Army to quell the crowds.  "I just don't think the Chinese communists can avoid it anymore," Cramer said. "The Chinese government is more worried about Hong Kong than they're worried about trade. Because Hong Kong is something that's very visible in Europe."  "This is more serious than the trade talks," he added. "If you want to know what could tip you into a worldwide recession, it is just a shutdown of Hong Kong."|2019-08-12 13:15:54

wp0i1i|cpavun|cpavun|5|I did some reading on what the 10/2 yield curve inversion caused *last time*. In August 2006 the yield curve inverted. In October 2007 the stock market peaked, a good deal higher than it had been in August 2006. SPY hit bottom in March of 2009, having lost like half its value.     So as we get nearer and nearer to the yield curve inversion, this could cause some panic in the markets, which means puts are great right now. If you bail on stocks completely right when the inversion happens, you will save yourself the pain of the recession but you might also miss out on riding that last blow off top.|2019-08-12 12:26:17

I also agree with the idea that IF Trump is wise enough to seek a trade truce going into the 2020 election, that trade truce is not likely to happen in the next few months. Frankly I don't know if the relationship between China and the Trump admin can be salvaged at this point.

wpf6qa|cpavun|cpavun|-1|If you guys saw my post earlier about the previous 2 years of trading, buy calls now! Promise they'll print tendies tomorrow and I can explain later just trying to get this in before 4pm  Edit: explanation ‚Äî  In the last 2 years we've had 28% of our days open red and close red. On average, those days had a low of -1.16% which we exceeded today down to about -1.45%.   The average opening into the next day is barely positive, but basically 0% change over night. The important part that I'm banking on and the reason I bought some FD calls at close is because the following day after a open red-close red day is the rally that will occur tomorrow. On average, the next day's close is basically flat. On average, the next day's close after a -1%+ day is flat. **But**, on average the next day's high is  0.53%, and 1.06% higher than today's close respectively.   Of all the red open/red close days, 43 days closed -1% or more and only 16% of them didn't have a strong rally the next day. The other 84% had an average high of 1.28% from today's close. Hoping to make some money off a sizable rally tomorrow and sell those calls if the market rallies 2/3 of the way or more to my target, which will be around 0.9% tomorrow.|2019-08-12 14:57:56
