Bonds are calling for a steep recession by middle of next year.  Not a chance that the heavily indebted parts of the US economy can survive 5% Fed Funds rate (which is what bonds are pricing in).  Stocks are considerably more bullish than that, pricing in a pivot by January with the Fed likely stopping around 4.25-4.5% and cutting below 4% by middle of next year.  Same divergence occurred late last year as bonds sold off hard while stocks kept rallying to new highs.  Bonds were right then, they'll end up being right again now imo.

They literally added nearly $400 million of unrealized revenue out of thin air by pretending a shit foreign exchange rate and strong dollar simply do not exist a to their EPS, or they would have missed. Nearly 80% of their sub add was from APAC in which those accounts are like $5 each after F/X.   “The company believes that constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average revenue per membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average revenue per membership, **the Company estimates the current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period.”**  They used USD increase in strength against Euro to bring EPS from 2.4 to 3.2.  "EPS of $3.10 vs. $3.19 a year ago included a $348 million non-cash unrealized gain from F/X remeasurement on our Euro denominated debt."🤣 This is why actual rev met expectations while EPS beat.

This happens when there's way too much option trading and market makers have to hedge with shares/shorts because option spreads are shitty. When the ratio is highly skewed, it tends to pull the market in the opposite direction.  This happens in the week or two leading up to opex, and it takes a break on the Wednesday VIX expiry (don't ask me why). After OPEX, the influence of vanna and charm disappear and the market does what it wanted to do.  Since today is VIX expiry, it's a preview of what next week may look like.  This is just one pressure on price action. There are many, and it can easily be overwhelmed by good or bad news.|2022-10-19 13:48:23syyp6n|y7yiub|y7yiub|6|I will not let you down, no matter what it takes - Papa Musk says this.

(They keep $20 since option price is 100x) Even if the value hits $5.00, they won’t fill until the spread is in their favor so they can make a profit from the trade.

We've only had a few months of high rates.   Most economists and Fed officials think they will be high for 2-3 years.    And we might not be able to bring down inflation with only rate increases.   It may even make things worse, as businesses with lower sales still have to cover fixed costs, and may even have to raise prices on lower volumes to make it happen.   Reagan/Volker brought down inflation via high rates AND supply side economics.   It takes a bumper crop in supply to reduce prices, and Biden has no fucking clue about this.  Neither does Powell who is a lawyer not an economist by training.   Just listen to Arther Laffer (Reagan advisor) or Jeremy Siegel.   Both think Fed is steering us towards hard hard landing.|2022-10-19 12:22:20syvk2w|y7yiub|y7yiub|8|Coffee has a temperature/taste curve that’s like  Too hot  Too hot  Too hot  Perfectly drinkable for .5 seconds  Tepid ass water that tastes like burnt mud|2022-10-19 13:30:50syw7j5|y7yiub|y7yiub|8|Covered calls printing again, third week in a row $700 ![img](emotet5_2th524276)|2022-10-19 13:35:04syz9hg|y7yiub|y7yiub|8|How is Tesla not limit up after that tweet|2022-10-19 13:54:34syzja4|y7yiub|y7yiub|8|I think Elong might try to pump&dump TSLA after earnings to pay off his Twitter debt next week.|2022-10-19 13:56:17syzxig|y7yiub|y7yiub|8|Elon can't wait to fingerblast that Sell button.|2022-10-19 13:58:48sz0lmc|y7yiub|y7yiub|7|Musk trying to pump TSLA, books are cooked|2022-10-19 14:03:08sz3xu6|y7yiub|y7yiub|8|How do you even trade that premium on Tesla ?![img](emotet5_2th524271)  Options chain is unusable.|2022-10-19 14:24:02sz40z3|y7yiub|y7yiub|9|That tweet before earnings is a great way to have regulators all over your ass.|2022-10-19 14:24:35sz41w6|y7yiub|y7yiub|8|Either Tesla calls or sidelines.

Nothing in the macro has changed significantly, and I cant imagine how the fed could pivot even if they wanted to.  There are ~18 trading days till the Novembers expire. But to be conservative and give ourselves some bumper room for dumb shit, lets go for 12 trading days.  If the macros hold up (not sure how they cant), that means we should expect a 0.966 - 1.224 price decrease in VMBS between now and November 18th.  Puts the price range at 42.69 - 42.94 the week of November 18th. Bid/ Ask on the 44's is .80 - .95, which implies the market is pricing about the same move as the TA above.  Possible plays would be to ghetto spread the 43's in a hope of a big move once the October monthlies expire. For example, after the Septembers expired, the price dropped almost $2, and then pretty much recovered, to bleed out the rest of the month.  !banbet VMBS to 43 29 days  Positions: 25 $47 puts purchased in July, expiring November 18th.|2022-10-19 13:37:17sywqgx|y7yiub|y7yiub|3|I have a mole in my yard, how should I go about eradicating him?|2022-10-19 13:38:27syx08j|y7yiub|y7yiub|3|Did you see the look in your wife’s eyes when I came in the room?

That decline was immediately following the banner year of Q4 2017 where sales of the iPhone had increased by 13% from Q4 2016.   In 2020 and 2021, apple sold a metric fuck ton of iPhones. In Q4 2021 alone, sales of the iPhone increased by about 9% from 2020. That was following a 17% increase of iPhone sales from Q4 2020 relative to 2019.   It’ll be interesting to see how apple guides for Q4 when they report earnings. They made way more money than usual the last two years, but one has to believe they pulled forward ton of demand. There is nothing in the product or revenue pipeline as big as the iPhone. Can you imagine how the stock would perform if services revenue growth stalls? Sales of the iPhone should drop substantially, and maybe you’ll see another 15% drop in iPhone sales similar to Q4 2018. The stock price should follow, we will see. In 2018, it moved down something like 5% after earnings, and even more in the following months.

I'm friends with a clerk at WalMart and she told me the younger workers, when they do hire on, rarely last more than a week or two because they don't like the grind of a full-time job.  I don't know what's going to happen when the older folks are no longer able to work.  I lived in a mixed age neighborhood, everyone from twentysomethings to retirees, and none of the young people appear to have jobs.  They hang out at home all day and smoke weed.
