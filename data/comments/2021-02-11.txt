mz0361|lhifig|lhifig|13|I think the reason you all got the rug pulled and got screwed over on the weed stocks was because right before market open the brokerages all upped the margin requirements on GRWG and anything cannabis-related to 100%. I know smart, non-risky people who got margin called. I was looking for an explanation on how the weed stocks could all go from double digit gains premarket to double digit losses premarket and I’m pretty sure this is the explanation. WSB is big enough now that it can love a stock to death.   Consequently, I’m thinking weed stocks might be a great buy from here on the massive dip, as there’s still very bullish sentiment long term and the 100% margin req jump has already happened. I heard from somebody else SNDL had a 1000% margin req. I took the opportunity to add GRWG LEAPs.|2021-02-11 13:17:03

I'm really sad for anyone that got duped by GME and didn't learn their lesson and FOMOd into weed stocks.  And I'm saying this as someone who still has an APHA bag|2021-02-11 10:36:33

Earnings are on the 24th so potential news could be coming but wouldn't expect it.  This is a company in its infancy with legit employees and board members like Andrew Card (former secretary of transportation).  They aren't a scam and aren't gonna hype on Twitter.

mxjurx|lhifig|lhifig|29|There’s no right or wrong. 1 day TLRY is the biggest mover, next day is SNDL, next day could be APHA or ACB or CGC, who knows?  Just pick one you like and hold! WSB fomo has already begun and it’s just now hitting the media. I’m expecting today and tomorrow to start hitting the public. With weekend building up fomo for the rest of the players who will enter late and become bag holders. This is perfect timing since it’s happening right after GME. Lots of inexperienced people will probably fomo in thinking these weed tickers will be the next GME.  I’m holding my current positions and buying more calls at open with the rest of my buying power. Plan to hold until Monday and I’ll sell at least half my positions and let the rest ride. Weed stocks are a great long term play with US legislation. But be honest with yourselves and don’t fall for the trap. Too much fomo right now and there will be a pullback. Play the short term for now. Re enter the long term after the pullback.

myv0bd|lhifig|lhifig|22|There was a GME short squeeze and the stock shot way up and came back down... This weed stock movement is absolutely nothing like that. I think a lot of you are forgetting that GME wasn’t in the process of establishing a legal pot market in a country with a GDP of +$20 Trillion and annual alcohol sales in the hundreds of billions (not even getting into the pharma sales). This isn’t a trend that’ll just go away because people aren’t interested in the tickers.  Most of these companies (particularly the MSOs imo) are growing like CRAZY if you look at their revenue (I mean seriously look up the quarterly revenue of Cresco Labs over time). I think everyone here seems to need this reminder:  Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker, and Ron Wyden are STILL pushing to finally end the war on drugs and give states the option to legalize marijuana in the US. (AKA DEMOCRATS THAT WANT WEED TO BE LEGAL ARE CURRENTLY CALLING THE SHOTS WITHIN THE US GOVERNMENT and they’re actively working on making this a reality)  US dispensaries are STILL closer than they ever have been to being able to actually work with big banks in the US.   A lot of MSO tickers are STILL close to being added to the NYSE.    It’ll be a bumpy ride but this isn’t a pump and dump, rise and collapse situation. These are companies that are poised to be the next Anheuser-Busch & MillerCoors sized companies and it’s happening right in front of us.|2021-02-11 12:41:41

Just goto their website and check Q3 report.  Page 6. “Sundial does not engage in any U.S. cannabis-related activities as defined in Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352.”  Also page 6. “ Furthermore, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a limited operating history and a history of negative cash flows from operating activities.”  Honestly read thru the “Going concern assumption” on page 6.

mxfhji|lhifig|lhifig|56|I’ll say it again for all you slow readers.  Hey you idiots. TLRY and APHA are merging. For every 1 APHA stock you get .83 TLRY. You do the current math. Why would you buy TLRY? APHA is $28. TLRY is $72. That’s a .38/1 ratio. So by buying 1 APHA stock you’re essentially getting 2x your money in TLRY once the merge happens in 2 months.  Either APHA shoots up to match that .83/1 ratio or TLRY comes down. Why bet on the one that could go down. Bet on the one that guarantees you either a win or a break even.  Both could go down, that’s the only risk with APHA. But compared to TLRY it’s such an obvious choice. By buying APHA you ARE buying TLRY, just on sale.|2021-02-11 05:44:18

mzfhdq|lhifig|lhifig|13|Yesterday, 2/10/21, CNBC announced around 12pm that Pot Stocks were booming, then many rushed after hours to place "puts" on all the Pot stocks that were discussed in the chat.  During 4 am- 9am pre-market today, 2/11/21, stocks rallied to record highs on weed and by 9:30 AM, they dropped significantly.  Why?  CNBC opened up about this morning about how "Reddit" "WSBs" and "Pot" were in play.... During Pre Market.....  I investigated unusual options activity on [barchart](https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/stocks?orderBy=optionsTotalVolume&orderDir=desc) and SNDL was laced with puts for 2/12.  Then on [Nasdaq Trader](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts#) at 9:34:21 am, the Stock halted till 9:39:21 am, killing momentum for those just hopping in (code: LUDP-Volatility Trading Pause).  Then OGI  got hit at the following times today too:  1. 9:32 - 9:37am 2. 9:42: - 9:47am  (With code: LUDP too)  Once this happened, fear panic and the loss of life and limb happened. Everyone scattered to protect their gains and left the wave......Then this happened...  CNBC reported that Pot lost their smoke with Reddit people early in the morning. Did Pot move like silver?, Where the gain was epic at the low levels, then crash just days later when the stock overcooked? This has been the discussion all day.....  Then This shyt happens.....CNBC announced that the feds are interviewing the various people in reddit to see if some of the occupants are manipulating the market with their investment firms.....  Morale of Story... Once CNBC mentions the Stock we discuss, its "Grand Opening/Grand Closing on the stock"|2021-02-11 15:05:58

Y’all are pumping and dumping like a teen that learned how to jerkoff for the first time.  Through attrition of these pumps and dumps a % of you will always have bought the top like a retard. And a % of the bag holders will stubbornly hold your bags until you can no longe financially play with us retards.  I believe we will reach a peak sub count of around 9-10 million.  And from there with every successful pump you retards initiate a group of you will hold the bag. I see the sub losing 50% of the new active members by May.  Good luck autists.

myk9tz|lhifig|lhifig|18|You guys realize Sndl is a scam right? I read thru their financial reports last night. Legit garbage company.  Valued the same as Aphria... what????  Revenues of only 60mil Canadian. Losing money. Diluting. It’s all in the Q3 report!  Q3 Report - would link, but post keeps on getting removed due to auto mod thinking some letters are a ticker. Just goto their website and check Q3 report.    Page 6. “Sundial does not engage in any U.S. cannabis-related activities as defined in Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352.”  Also page 6. “ Furthermore, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a limited operating history and a history of negative cash flows from operating activities.”  Honestly read thru the “Going concern assumption” on page 6. Total JOKE! Y’all bout to get scammed!|2021-02-11 11:27:37

mxewnd|lhifig|lhifig|22|SNDL is gonna burn sooner or later. Right now its a meme stock and the gains it made arent representative of the actuall value.  If ur looking for pot stock, and i do understand that, you could also look at some long term.  APHA en TLRY aren going to merg. Making them the biggest out there. Every Apha stock is gonna be valued 0.8381 TLRY.  Right now, in premarket they are worth:  APHA - 29.10  TLRY - 72.55  In theory APHA should be worth 0.8381 TLRY stock, so 60.80 (obviously TLRY could sink, but thats still not negative on APHA)  Thats some solid 5 finger discount.|2021-02-11 05:36:14

mxfeyy|lhifig|lhifig|25|Bag holders, the game is inflate a stock, pump it high, sell before close at double, puts on the crash, major profit from both riding the wave and predicting the crash.  Stop holding worthless stocks longer than you need too. You're not making a profit, you're screwing play makers out of moves.   SNDL is a pump and dump, DON'T JUMP IN ON IT YOU WILL ONLY LOSE MONEY! It has risen over 100% in under a week. The only way this ends well if they're bought, which admittedly would make you THOUSANDS depending when you bought in but I doubt that.   I'm not an expert, but this is a second opinion that is sorely needed from someone with 30 shares at 2.5, having cashed in almost 500 shares.|2021-02-11 05:43:19

mxkk5u|lhifig|lhifig|9|I keep coming back to the Keynesian beauty contest, but I think it really explains SNDL better than anything.  Yeah, SNDL doesn’t make the best fundamentals or really what you’d look for in a growth stock. Lots of shares outstanding, rocky history, low profit to current marketcap.   But it does have a lot of things that you can predict less informed traders will go after. Lower cost per share, a higher price at IPO (when they had less shares outstanding) and now name recognition.   If you’re going to trade, you need to let go of the notion that these things are going to happen rationally, and start looking at the actual reasons why big booms happen.|2021-02-11 06:48:00

Bought APHA yesterday at $26 and it's absolutely drilling. Like, holy shit. I've lost well over 2k today (i'm not rich, so it hurts) and i've lost some of my amazing gains from GME and others. I'll admit APHA was a bit of a FOMO, and i had some leftover money i wanted to risk a bit, didn't expect it to go like this though. Also doesn't help that i bought CRSR before earnings.  No idea if i should just sell in case it keeps drilling, or if i should hope for a recoil tomorrow. This shit is depressing lol.|2021-02-11 14:27:53

mxqzei|lhifig|lhifig|16|   Also, don't be morons that think that the market will always go up!  You should've learned your lesson with GME, the only thing that we're sure of is that the market is going up and down, no one knows where.  Set a cap for your gains, and take out your money, it's better to get +50% while the stock is giving you gains than to get -50% because you were greedy.  "But it could go higher", Yes, it can, it will, but the only money that you truly have is the money that's in your wallet, stocks are not money, I've learned that the hard way already.  Be responsible, peace!|2021-02-11 07:51:57

myangt|lhifig|lhifig|4|r/weedstocks is a better sub-reddit for Pot stocks. These big Gap ups and fades are normal for anyone trading these stocks for the last couple years. It's just a little more extreme now because of all the trading volume. Bag holding a stock sucks. But at least its in a growing sector with more upcoming catalyst. Remember, the big MSOs will eventually list on the US exchanges, then its a party. $TLRY $VFF which are Canadian, currently have the advantage of being listed on the US exchanges. So they get the volume! Add to that their small floats and hold on.  These are my 2 short term monthly plays.

What she is hammering on about the broader macroeconomics is that the economy is already doing well than what the Biden Administration would like us to believe.   The stimulus is absolutely huge compared to all other previous ones, so this with an already decent economy (except leisure industries), we are gonna see a 'fire economy', which will increase inflation, CPI index, and everything else.   &#x200B;  not sure what exactly she means by fire economy, but I guess a big yay for broader indexes?|2021-02-11 10:50:57

mxkpml|lhifig|lhifig|15|SNDL OGI etc have strong momentum this week...CBNC have mentioned them twice already in a weed segment today. Looks like today will be strong and again into tomorrow.   Both rose at open yesterday then dipped but then strong volume throughout the afternoon drove both of these much higher again. Think they have serious gains to give this week and probably some smaller next week.    The weed price wave is happening across many stocks due to moves towards legalisation and acquisitions. WSB sentiment is driving broader retail so suggest keep comments positive if you want to make better gains!  For SNDL, yesterday I thought 4 was a good target for today,  but now looks like 6+ achievable. Tomorrow I suspect 12+, but my estimates can be low. Remember only take risks you can handle. Buy, sell for gains, buy again, etc.  We are here for profit, not glory! (Well some glory - DFV!)  🚀🚀🚀🌚🤑🥳|2021-02-11 06:49:43

mxhnm8|lhifig|lhifig|13|$MVIS!! I know a lot of you are into the Weed stocks but $MVIS just keeps getting pushed down the board. The last post I have seen was 4 days ago and even since then $MVIS is up over 100%. We got the news we have been waiting for after close yesterday and a lot of shorts are trapped over 20 million or so. To get some diversity from the weed sector I still highly recommend $MVIS. Even at this $20 range we are still extremely undervalued. The chart setup is phenomenal and with the news that our Lidar specs are going to blow all of the competitors away, I fully expect at least a$35-$40 share price in the near future. Most people expect $70+ and some evaluations put us at a target of $138 a share.|2021-02-11 06:13:10

Once your ticker is mentioned over 1,000 times in circulation here AND it breaks the fucking news on CNBC, its time to sell bro and find another stealth trade before hype gets in. Like, by the time UPST gets circle jerked here forming a bank gang, that'll be my exit strategy to sell at the time (it'll be at $250 per share by then).  **Buy early, sell the news.**|2021-02-11 09:43:15

mzav9p|lhifig|lhifig|17|To those of you that are buying shares and constantly asking "what's the next play?" my advice is to learn how to read a balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. I don't just mean look for bigger numbers, I mean really understand the story they tell of how the business operates.  Got that down? Good. Now find a stock screener, pick an industry you know about, and set your filters to find something that fits your preferences. Go to that company's website. Download their quarterly earnings presentations and look at the full 10-Q/K for the company. Read the notes. The story is in the notes.  Now, do you like what you see? Then if you believe in the company, have at it. That's "the next play" because you'll have your convictions to buy and hold through the dips and chops. It takes work. Otherwise, you're just chasing others and buying the top.  Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.|2021-02-11 14:33:04

This is not a glitch in the system this is a long solved problem over the last 20 years. Instead the problem is you got margin called lol. Dont be stupid with your margin and life is good. Margin isnt free it's the equivalent of a payday loan and they can force collection by selling your stocks! Use it for very short term leverage (you have cash in your bank to bail out if the trade goes south, but dont have time to transfer it in to get in on a trade)|2021-02-11 09:23:33

Just goto their website and check Q3 report.  Page 6. “Sundial does not engage in any U.S. cannabis-related activities as defined in Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352.”  Also page 6. “ Furthermore, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a limited operating history and a history of negative cash flows from operating activities.”  Honestly read thru the “Going concern assumption” on page 6.

Please realize that $APHA has A LOT going for it and is NOT a meme stock; so many catalysts:  1. Merger w TLRY 2. U.S. weed legalization 3. U.S. weed banking reform 4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries 5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share) 6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution 7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 25-30% at present  $TLRY dropped this AM but this always happens; the squeeze play is real:  1.

mxcs88|lhifig|lhifig|18|Y’all please just hear me out.  I want us all to make money and be happy.  If you’re jumping into weedstocks- understand there is a difference in what you buy.  You will lose money on APHA and Tilray if you are INVESTING at these levels.  Sure, trade them all you want.  Understand that it’s going to be volatile.    I have been trading in this sector for many years.   If you want to invest- VFF is your best bet on Canadian companies.  Other than that- you need to be in an American MSO.   Don’t have time to research individual names?  MSOS is an ETF that includes only US cannabis companies.   They have options that are volatile enough to please WSBs.   TLDR: There is a difference in weedstock companies.   Long VFF and MSOS   I’m willing to bet a lot of money on it.  100k in shares.

Not to mention, look at Match's current share price. It's the only other dating app that's traded publicly so the competition is minimal.   Too me, Bumble is at a discount at 43 dollars. There may be a dip but after that I could see it climbing close to 100 but not quite near Match since Match just is a more encompassing dating platform.|2021-02-11 10:26:37

Just goto their website and check Q3 report.    Page 6. “Sundial does not engage in any U.S. cannabis-related activities as defined in Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352.”  Also page 6. “ Furthermore, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a limited operating history and a history of negative cash flows from operating activities.”  Honestly read thru the “Going concern assumption” on page 6.

myoxw2|lhifig|lhifig|18|Well r/WallStreetBets it’s been a lot of fun. This was the last outpost of Old School Reddit you could find on here and now it’s totally fucking ruined. The whole sub has just turned into one big god damn pump and dump swarmed by the fucking idiots who occupy the rest of this site. The ones who think it’s cool and edgy to talk about taking down the hedge funds because  “muh socialism”. This sub was about one thing. One god damn thing. Making money. Leaving the rat race forever. That’s it.  Now anytime I see stocks I’m playing start showing up in here I know it’s just a matter of time before the suits out there in the shadows shark the absolute shit out of you morons. First they let you run and gun and think you’re all geniuses and then comes the pull. But in the aftermath the stocks will be totally untouchable for months afterwards. If you’re new here and have no idea what you’re doing just know that I hate you all. To all the OG’s it’s been fun. Maybe this will migrate somewhere else, somewhere more private, but I really, really doubt it and I know it’ll never be the same.  Downvote me into oblivion. I don’t fucking care. We’ve been overrun by the very people I’ve come to hate on the rest of this site and they’ve completely ruined the only place I’ve been able to enjoy myself during this god forsaken time.

HOL and BB is taking their sweet ass time. All my baby yolo stocks (COTY, ZOM, NXE) just aren't getting my dick wet anymore, but I can wait. The thing I can't forgive is PLTR lol. I just keep pocking it like are you dead bitch or are you gonna move. Cause I am past panic selling lol I will just wait. I made my gains from the weed and got out in time. I am sorry for those that got left with paper bags. A real pump and dump on the part of the hedge funds and institutional investors I think.

Did a little math and found that every drop, the day *after* the first day it opens below 100, it drops an average of 9% (with a range of like 6-14%).

my2p83|lhifig|lhifig|9|Guys and gals Do yourself a favor and check out $MVIS. We are getting ready to see a short squeeze of epic proportions. I have been trying to mention this for a while now but it keeps getting pushed down the threads. You don’t have to enter one of these companies that are at or above value. $MVIS is a solid company and owns the rights to so many patents. The real winner is the Lidar, we got the PR on the specs yesterday and it blows all others out of the water. April is demo day, look into it. Come to R/MVIS and read the DD. It’s all there and after you are done you are going to ask yourself why you didn’t find this sooner. This is a Holy Grail of investments|2021-02-11 09:24:13

Revenues of only 60mil Canadian. Losing money. Diluting. It’s all in the Q3 report!  Q3 Report - would link, but post keeps on getting removed due to auto mod thinking some letters are a ticker. Just goto their website and check Q3 report.  Page 6. “Sundial does not engage in any U.S. cannabis-related activities as defined in Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352.”  Also page 6. “ Furthermore, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a limited operating history and a history of negative cash flows from operating activities.”  Honestly read thru the “Going concern assumption” on page 6.

Blatant MM!"  &#x200B;  Look, I can basically trade 24 hours a day due to the nature and size of my accounts, and it's a universal truth that you should never pay attention to much anything that happens after hours and should only pay attention for about 30 minutes pre-market, because volume is so low that the swings are, by design, very wild.  Even though I can trade at pretty much any time, I almost NEVER due unless it's on sudden news or an obvious rug pull because the volume is so weird that it's not based in reality.  Got caught chasing way too many times when I was younger.  &#x200B;  It's not bullshit what happens in these periods, it's just something people never saw before instant information.

n03hp9|lhifig|lhifig|5|Geebus... where did all the craziness go?  So, quick questions about the unexpectedness that happened today.  I was lucky and bought TLRY at a decent level mid price at 41.00 and it took off.  I was thinking I could ride the price for a couple of days and that surely it would go up.  I wake up around pre-market and it dropped a bit but was showing a downward trend but was confident it'll climb back up during market hours.  Wake up again during market hours and now I see this bitch trying to tank, so was lucky to still sell at a profit but would've made so much more....so question here.  For pump and dump stuff... does the major sell off's usually happen during pre-market?  Excuse my stupidness.|2021-02-11 18:12:32
mysahn|lhifig|lhifig|20|Look what you’ve done morons   We’ve become an atm for hedge funds cause they’ll just watch every pump and make sure they short it and make free money...

Like what causes a 30% drop in every single one of the weed stocks on the same day? Along with all the drops being basically completely parallel for all the stocks fall. Like how would I of known to sell this morning when nothing about the stock has changed and a merger between them hasnt even officially happened yet.

mz3bb5|lhifig|lhifig|7|SPCE is definitely the next high after weed!  This weekend's test is going to send the stock flying.  Checkout Virgin Galactic on Twitter for some videos of the prep. This rocket plane technology is far safer than the large booster rockets of SpaceX and BO. They can shut it off at any time. Plus rocket planes in the USAF had around a 99.5% safety record.   They are taking some NASA test payloads with them. And checking the new cabin etc.   They seem confident about this flight and this is one of the last FAA flight checks before commercial service. So looks great for prices mooning. Most WSB price estimates are in the $80-120 range if the next 3 flights go as planned. Which seems fair for the Tesla of space.

my58si|lhifig|lhifig|13|Im seeing too many ppl dancing in the tears of other's misfortunes.  Also a lot of hostility and blaming and condescending.  Things like "if you didnt know a dip was coming...."  or "thats your own fault"  Is this who we are? I have plenty of people, I know in real life, many of whom are actually financial pros who think this way.  "All these people making money on GME are going to lose everything and I cant wait."  The bitter jealousy.  If you saw a dump of Tlry coming and didnt FOMO/YOLO into it, good for you.  But there is no need to rub salt in the wounds of others.  Thats the opposite of what I thought we were about.  That being said, buy some F'ing pot stocks, ppl!  Supreme, Cronos, High Tide, Tilray!!  Lets rally together, get each others backs, and at the very least get back to even.  And if you dont want to participate, nobody can force you, but that doesnt mean you have to root against those of us who are trying to claw back.|2021-02-11 09:42:51

The algorithms may see what’s going on here and follow our *verybearly trends*, but their involvement is brief.  They see some hype and jump in, which boosts the stock, which creates lots of hype, but by the time the retards here jump in the algos and mms are out.   Weed stocks, BB, AMC... it’s all the same. By the time you see it on the frontpage here, it’s a dying position. Sure, it’ll go up a bit, but only just before tanking. GME was the exception, but even then only briefly.

mxnst2|lhifig|lhifig|5|I opened a Robinhood account the week before the GME craziness just to try it out, even though I already had a brokerage I used. My money cleared and I bought some stock and sold some covered calls. Robinhood offered me gold, and I took it to unlock the $5,000 instant deposit.   Yesterday I wanted to buy back my calls and unload the shares for a net profit, but needed to deposit funds. I sent them $2,500, and then they immediately hit me with an account deficit. Literally the second I made the deposit, and now I can't open positions or do anything. It clearly said on the app that I had $4000 remaining of instant deposits. The app won't tell me what the debt is for, and now that money is in limbo until it clears. They say it will take 1-3 DAYS to get back to me. Fuck this app. Don't bother with them.

Just announcing updates on its Lidar tech coming out in April and currently in a tech licensing agreement with Microsoft that's used in the hololens 2 (their royalties are currently paying off their prepayment, but you can see that on their earnings report though they don't mention Microsoft by name), and their touch screen projector tech that's product-ready but was delayed release by their partners due to covid shit.

mxi75j|lhifig|lhifig|12|Pot stocks have been SURGING. Multiple double baggers since October 2020, when it was crystal clear Biden was going to be the nominee and favorite to win the top US executive post. He and Harris have made it clear that decriminalization of pot (and examination of criminal records for those already convicted of pot-only crimes) will be a central social justice theme in their administration. There’s evidence that this single policy stroke has worked to bring over a lot of no-party-affiliated moderates, centrists, and independent voters to their side of the argument(s).  TLRY, APHA, OGI, ACB, CRON and CGC have fattened the wallets of savvy investors who understood how politics would help these companies in the near term. I LIKE THE STONKS.  Discussion point for fellow WSB fucktards and pussfarts: I’m reading where there is a sizable number of short positions in TLRY (which is the one listed that has already returned most hugely). Is that reality, you Bloomberg butt pirates? How does that reality sit with you all? Will it result in another short squeeze of TLRY?  I’m posting in hopes of changing the topic from yesterday’s news—GME, AMC, and BB. If you’re still holding, and shitposting about them, you are the bag men I’m afraid. Recover, move on, and readjust the trajectory of WE THE PEOPLE’S market so that more retarded autistic apes can get in EARLY on the next ride of possibility.

my3g6b|lhifig|lhifig|9|During the late 1920s, the stock market in the United States boomed. Millions of Americans began to purchase stock, causing the market to dramatically increase in value. Unfortunately for the economy, so many Americans invested money in the stock market that stocks became inflated in price. In essence, stocks were selling for more money than they were worth. In 1924, the New York Times index of the leading twenty-five industrial stocks topped the one hundred point mark. By the beginning of 1928, these same stocks had topped 245 points, more than doubling the stocks' price. The market continued to soar during 1928 and much of 1929, with these twenty-five leading industrial stocks reaching the 452 point mark in early September 1929, almost doubling the stocks' selling price in less than two years. One of the principal reasons for the skyrocketing prices was the fact that many Americans, more than ever before, began to purchase stocks. As stocks climbed in price, many Americans believed that they could amass a tremendous fortune, even if they owned only one or two shares of stock. Unfortunately for many potential investors, these people did not have enough money to afford shares of stock. Because of their limited capital, many investors purchased stock on credit. As long as the stock market continued to increase in value, these investors did stand to make a profit. Unfortunately for them, beginning in September 1929, the stock market began to decline in value as larger investors realized that the stocks were inflated in price. On October 23, the stock market lost thirty-one points, approximately seven percent of its value. Conditions worsened the next day. By mid-November, the twenty-five leading industrial stocks had dropped to 224 points, less than one-half of their value two months earlier. The market continued to decline in value, leaving investors who had purchased stock on credit financially destroyed. Faced with financial ruin, some investors took their own lives, believing that they would never be able to escape from their debts. This quick and precipitous decline in stocks' value in October 1929 became known as the Stock Market Crash of 1929. This event signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. During this economic downturn, millions of American workers lost their jobs. Industrial and construction workers faced some of the greatest hardships during this period. In Ohio, by 1933, more than forty percent of factory workers and sixty-seven percent of construction workers were unemployed. Farmers faced low prices for their products, and many consumers could still not afford to purchase the farmers' items, resulting in farm foreclosures across the United States. The apparent economic boom of the 1920s came to an abrupt halt in October 1929, as businesses and consumers had over extended themselves financially. The result was the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression.|2021-02-11 09:29:45

Looking for general stuff:  Relatively low commission ( we don't make 100k per year sigh), Pre-market / post-market possibility, options, solid broker that will have all the new IPOs and lot of other interesting tickers, level 2 quotes, no illogical bank transfers that cost lot of  money. Any advice ? Let me know even if you use one for interface and second for actual trading. I will personally thank you when I will be a millionaire !|2021-02-11 09:33:16

myewr8|lhifig|lhifig|2|So how do I close my robinhood account?  Opened it the day they blocked trading and I've finally transferred my money out except for the like 2 dollars I got from selling the free stock which is preventing me from closing the account.  Sold the stock over a week ago and when I try to deactivate the account it I won't because I have that 2 dollars of brokerage cash remaining but it won't let me transfer it to my bank account.  I don't even care about the $2 at this point, just want to close the account.  edit: finally found a link to e-mail their support. But if anyone knows a way to get rid of the brokerage cash quicker so I can transfer the account that'd be appreciated.|2021-02-11 10:50:38
myex5e|lhifig|lhifig|2|Just bought some 02/19 190c for Disney.  The stock is already up 30% last three months, but momentum could continue. Everybody and their dog has Disney plus. And we should start to get an idea about the retention rate as Verizon stops paying for users services. If that number is high, then oh boy. Oh boy. Anyways.  This is also a reopening play. Stock would be at 300 right now without pandemic. Disney plus growth still not fully priced in, imo.|2021-02-11 10:50:42

I see it at an easy 10 billion dollar market. I'm not telling anyone to sell or buy I just have high hopes for weed. Some of the wealthiest family come from alcohol so everyone knows weed is next!!!!

They have 50% of the ibuy market compared to zillows 25% but they don't have they online / IMT revunue to offset the operating losses (?) that the ibuying demands. I know they have a ton of ancillary service offerings to bring their margins up, and their conversion rate is higher.  tl;dr buy shares for the long game and pick up some March calls because it's gonna rip after earnings similar to Z. same bear risk is if jpow raises interests but that's not happening any time soon lmao|2021-02-11 06:05:25

myn5zu|lhifig|lhifig|4|$VGAC merger with 23&Me is gonna be lit. Happening by end of Q2 2021. Dipping a bit after news ($18 to $14.5 now).  Currently VGAC is estimated to be $857M market cap, 23&Me is private but valued at $3.5bn  Depends on the split/transfer of VGAC stock, but a likely $4.3bn market cap merged company at 65M shares is looking tasty at ~$66/share.   Threw 100 shares at it for now and will adjust as it gets closer to fruition.  Never done any real big DD but starting to gather some info on this one before it gains momentum.|2021-02-11 11:47:19

my3x52|lhifig|lhifig|6|The market is very volatile right now, and as we all know, it can be very hard to make money.  I’m a financial analyst, and here is my guide on how to go about this;  1. Resources to use  There are many available websites that can help you find the next big play. wheeldecide.com works great for me. Also, you can assign a stock a number and use googles Random number generator. If you are more an old fashioned kinda guy, a normal dice works too.  [Here is a template](https://wheeldecide.com/index.php?c1=GME&c2=GME+CALLS&c3=SELL+GME+PUTS&c4=GME+PUT+SPREAD&c5=LONG+CALL+LADDER+%28GME%29&c6=GME+COVERED+CALL&c7=EVERYTHING+ON+THE+WHEEL&time=5)  2. All in or you're not in  “My father, a medium-ranking stockbroker at a large firm, always told me to be wise with my Investments, and that patience was key. Every time he told me consistency was success, I would remind him that he was a boomer lmao FD yolo GME 1k EOW” - Dow "Chad" Jones  This excerpt shows us that even some of the great minds of the market used this feast-or-famine approach. No one is going to upvote your gain/loss porn unless it’s > 10k.  3. Utilize social media  Agilent technologies saw significant growth after Elon used the word “A” in his tweet.

mxpw03|lhifig|lhifig|4|I am buying **Weekly Puts on $HL** and here's why: HL is a mining company that among many materials, mines gold and **silver**. It's share price surged two weeks ago when the hedgies lured many people into the fake Silver Squeeze, and naturally, mining companies were profiting off it too. Before that, the share price was heading down and was below 5$. They missed 3/4 of their last earnings and were non-profitable for the past 3 years and what looks to be the fourth consecutive year now. They announced they have produced 7% more silver, but their largest gold mine produced 23% less gold. **They have their Q4 earnings call on Feb 18**. IV for 19/02 options is 80% which is good considering everything.  They were down 3.2% yesterday and are up 0.6% pre-market right now. As soon as market opens I will have my order filled to get: FEB 19 **6** PUT @ 0.20$.   This isn't going to make you rich if it even plays out well, but might net a nice 50% profit|2021-02-11 07:42:11

Sorry, this not a meme stock, but a solid investment, and definitely poised for future growth. It is the only rare earth company of its kind in North America, and China (so far its biggest customer) has recently restricted export of the materials it produces, having declared them a key strategic asset. This will leave them as the primary supplier of rare earth materials used in magnets for the North American domestic electric vehicle sector -- which I think you'll agree is a huge growth market.

BB had so many 15c to 25cs expire worthless.  Not to mention a stock who cant be named got shorted for literally more than shares avaliable. Naked shorting is illegal. Not to mention they did this to attack a company who was already really struggling due to the pandemic and a shift in technology killi g their biggest way of making money.  I hope the people in Washington know what happened and throw the book at these crooks who cheated to take billions away ftom retail investors.

Just goto their website and check Q3 report.  Page 6. “Sundial does not engage in any U.S. cannabis-related activities as defined in Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352.”  Also page 6. “ Furthermore, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a limited operating history and a history of negative cash flows from operating activities.”  Honestly read thru the “Going concern assumption” on page 6.

Strong management, already profitable, great execution 7.

Things are starting to come together so hopefully the experience will pay off to get my own operation off the ground at some point.  Its been a long fucking 8 years though.

Got PTSD from GME and feeling like I should sell, but I actually believe these stocks have a future because weed.  Am I still stupid?

mz01ai|lhifig|lhifig|1|Reposting this from a comment I made in response to someone about BMBL since some of you may find this helpful for determining if buying at IPO is a good idea:  &#x200B;  >Purely looking at the financials, MTCH has a 2.7B annual revenue compared to BMBL's 488M. MTCH has EBIT of 761M whereas BMBL has an EBIT of 93M. MTCH has a market cap of 45B, and BMBL has a market cap of $13B.   >   >If MTCH is pulling in 5.5x more revenue, 8x more earnings before interest and tax, but is only worth 3.4x in market cap, to me that says either MTCH is undervalued in this market, or BMBL is overvalued.   >   >Sure we can speculate about market share and people moving from MTCH owned services like match dot com or tinder to bumble but you have to recognize this is a space that has high competition and is a free product for the majority of users. I don't even like MTCH as a company, but it's valuation based on the money it currently makes is at least somewhat logical.   >   >Like I said, why is BMBL worth 75% more now than it was yesterday? The fact that the public can buy it and for some reason loves pouring money into IPOs? In my opinion, this thing is going the way of $WORK, not $ABNB. It's an inferior company that's best prospect is being acquired.   >   >I just don't think there is anything concrete we can point to right now to justify this price, it's pure speculation about what they might be able to do.  &#x200B;  Or buy it now, whatever, I don't really care.

It’s up 35% this last week with consistent gains and 330% the last 3 months. Not sure expansions in the industry and the companies recent developments as well as pushing for FDA approval seems to be driving it higher.

mxwo8q|lhifig|lhifig|2|Tried to make a post but didn't make it through automod.   To start off, this is not be bashing or rooting for any stock, this is what I personally have learned about myself and WSB after my entry into stocks and WSB after GME.  I first started researching and playing around with the stock market in November as a way to invest extra money I had at the end of the month. My main goal was to use it as a funky savings account that I could bet on stocks that I viewed as safe, make my money grow, and most importantly, pull money out of any time I wanted (unlike any "safe" investment options I could find that had any hint of gain).  So then comes GME. I've been lurking WSB for years, seeing it pop up on [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all) and [r/popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular), so of course I hop in and sub as soon as I have an investment account. I had a total of about $700 in my CMA with Merrill Edge, and watched GME as DFV and others talked it up, I went ahead and grabbed 2 @47 to play with it and learn what I was doing as a noob. A few days later I went all in @97 and I was along for the ride. Not a lot of money, but all I had. I watched and drooled as the prices went up and up and up and everyone was talking about rockets and diamond hands and short squeezes. It was such a fucking high, I already had plans to sell off at 1k, at 5k and 10k and what my financial plans would be if it reached each of those markers. Then the rules changed and the price fell, and all of those plans with it.   What I learned from all of this is I am a retard. I found out I love this shit, I love the risk, the reward, and I don't mind losing. Also, this sub is not for investors, it's for gambling.  I didn't join the weed games (yet, I may later if I don't miss the bus) because I'm tapped out for now. I also understand that if I just follow you retards I will likely always be late to the bus, so once I get built back up y'all can expect some noob DD and loss porn.   I am still holding like a 💎👐 retard because well, I think I am one. At an average cost of $80 and only dropping $700 into it, I damn sure ain't selling for anything less than the moon. Maybe we will get there tomorrow, maybe in 2 it 3 years idk I'm new to this shit.   TLDR: WSB good, gme maybe good maybe bad, I'm new and like it here.|2021-02-11 08:39:20

And the DOD has already purchased millions of dollars worth of their CELLECTRA devices used to administer their vaccine as soon as it is complete.

I told them to hold gme and buy the dip. 78% short interest.  It is the only safe play right now.  So many traps with these weed stocks and now millions ,if not billions, investors are bagholders because of it.   BUY GME SHARES AND HOLD.  YOUR FAITH WILL BE REWARDED.

mxmlj8|lhifig|lhifig|1|If anyone is cash gang (or keeping a bigger cash position rn) and you want to do a bit better, check out Invesco's PHDG. Gives you low beta movement with the S&P but also captures volatility. So a big move like last march it actually spiked 20-30%, but a small correction where vol doesn't spike much it will mostly move down with S&P. Interesting hedge play imo.  &#x200B;  "The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by using a quantitative, rules-based strategy that seeks to obtain returns that exceed the S&P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR Index (the Index). The Index provides investors with broad equity market exposure with an implied volatility hedge by dynamically allocating between equity, volatility and cash. The index allows investors to receive exposure to the equity and volatility of the S&P 500 Index in a dynamic framework."|2021-02-11 07:10:01

From what I understand it seems really low risk and I am always looking for low risk plays to shuffle some of my savings into so not all of my plays are moonshots. Anyway, what is the risk of selling puts on a high div yield stock? If I sell puts at a OTM strike lower than current price and the stock doesnt dip and I get assigned at the strike, great, I picked up a div yield stock at a discount. I would be out the options premium but I would make it back over time with div yield. If it becomes ITM I can sell the intrinsic value of the option instead of taking the shares for the profit. If the stock raises, what happens?Whats the real risk here? I have only ever traded naked options for a couple years and I am trying to get into more in depth options strategies and I am not sure if I am using them correctly.|2021-02-11 10:10:14

my0foa|lhifig|lhifig|1|Why has ESTA had a continual climb from $17 to $67 in 3 months. IMO also a buy out play . Best of luck.( BTW , a word to the wise. TLRY while listed in the US is a Canadian Company it is not in position to benefit from US legalization. It has a target price based on it’s fundamentals of only $15 per share, be careful )  “Additionally, Establishment Labs has commissioned extensive third-party market research from multiple firms that surveyed approximately 4,300 women, ages 18-55, across eleven key markets. The research concluded that the annual global market size for Motiva MIA is 1.9 million procedures, which translates to a total addressable market of $4-5 billion. A key finding of the research is that approximately 50% of respondents, while aware of traditional breast augmentation, would not undergo traditional surgery, but would pursue the Motiva MIA procedure within the next 12 months based on its expected benefits over existing surgical practices and implant characteristics.“  [https://investors.establishmentlabs.com/press-releases](https://investors.establishmentlabs.com/press-releases)|2021-02-11 09:07:36

mylmlh|lhifig|lhifig|0| \#justiceforNLST  (apologies in advance mods, but this injustice is truly sad and worth sharing, unless you're into big tech crushing the little guy)  Interesting comment from Googlestoleourpatent on yahoo finance board.  "David and Goliath story. Netlist (NLST) patent was stolen 12 years ago by Google after they signed an NDA to look at Netlists memory patent. Then Google promptly bootlegged it through a Chinese manufacturer screwing Netlist a California company. Google thought they could bankrupt Netlist but CEO fought back for 12 years and won a final victory against Google June 15 2020 when the federal appeals court upheld the lower courts decision against google in 78 claims with a rule 36 decision. Google exhausted all appeals and soon the USPTO will issue the new patent recertification upholding all 78 claims. Stay against Google will be lifted. Do your DD and understand this is a seminal patent that propelled Google to the forefront of searches with stolen Tech. Its time for Google to pay. Many of us believe that Google has paid manipulators to artificially deflate this stocks price. Check out their patent and see if you agree. Damage award should be in the Billions."|2021-02-11 11:36:52

my3bts|lhifig|lhifig|-26|Hey guys, thanks for all these pump and dump schemes. I've been making a lot of money on them.  I love it when we drive the stock prices wayyyy up and all these new people spend wayy too much money on the overpriced shares and we cash out at their expense. It's like a fun game of being smarter than the new guy!  &#x200B;  What idiot actually thinks TLRY is worth what its worth now? Only a chimp that just joined this sub, knows no fundamentals, and is ready to part with way too much money on a gamble  &#x200B;  It's actually probably really fucking illegal. But that's fine, as long as we're the ones profiting.   You guys know about the secret WSB elite, right? The guys that set the plays, get in way early, then call you newbies to the frontlines to bag hold?  This strategy is working very well. Almost too easy to manipulate you really. You think we're all the same, playing the same game, fighting the same fight; but we're not.  &#x200B;  I just want your fuckin money honey, and then you can bag hold till you die for all I care.  &#x200B;  goddamn I love taking money from these ignorant fucks and leaving them and their families as  bag holders  &#x200B;  it feels damn good|2021-02-11 09:28:53

mxl5ke|lhifig|lhifig|-5|So...I don't play options...my dad was a day trader ...so I have serious daily anxiety from watching charts bred into me.  So serious question. I need some tendies. I'm having FOMO...which is dangerous because it means I'm skewing emotional on my trades.   Do you think this SNDL rally will continue? Or is there another sector we're moving to next week?  If we're taking a page from Jack Kellogg (blech) maybe minerals? N-A-K? It's currently right around a dollar...  I want my tendies. My gains are flacid and boring.  On another level...I'm very much about the long term...so the fomo could just be me being jealous of another trading strategy paying off in this moment.  The meme craze will blow over...Cramer wishes (may he take a hot metal rod in the bunghole). Or will it? I love the way we can share thoughts on companies...but right now things are so volatile that it scares the fiscally conservative part of my retard brain into thinking that we're all gonna be fucked when the dollar tanks. That these are mini-bubbles...idk. I'm anxious about it.    So. I ask.

What are, in your opinion, the chances that CCIV announces this Merger tuesday, I.e. before Feb 19 expiration?  My guess is 50% chance.  That makes the 1.30$ FD's for next Friday very attractive:  \- potential loss is only 100%  \- potential gain: a few 1000's of %%%  &#x200B;  A binary bet: is 50% chance of DA this merger Tuesday realistic, or do you think the odds are worse than that?|2021-02-11 10:34:39

mzy6uc|lhifig|lhifig|-4|Hi everyone!  Novice to stocks here, but fascinated with how this sub put Wall Street in its place. You've turned many heads and flipped the script on several stocks.  That being said, for some weird reason (maybe because I liked watching something dead twitch), I've kept an eye on Helios and Matheson stock (remember them... they were the Movie Pass people... that didn't end well), and about a year ago, they finally called it quits and went belly up... ever since, their stock has traded between $0.000 and $0.001... however, it jumped up to 0.003 on Tuesday, and 0.012 yesterday. It is worth mentioning that it did drop 50% today, but still above what it's been for almost the past two years.  So I just gotta ask... was it you folks? Are you planning on sending $HMNY #tothemoon???|2021-02-11 17:28:20

myn86l|lhifig|lhifig|-6| "NLST is making that slow steady powerful rise up the charts in recent months that speaks of big things coming on the horizon. The stock is quickly becoming a leader in small caps regularly trading $3 million plus in daily dollar volume and attracting legions of new shareholders who continue to bid the stock higher. Many naysayers suggested the stock would drop off its July highs after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decision upholding the validity of Netlist’s U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent that applies to DDR server memory modules. While NLST did give back some gains at the time the stock has been moving up steadily with power ever since. Microcapdaily suggested in July that there were way too many good things happening here for Netlist not to keep rising.     Netlist is easily among the most exciting stories in small caps; the big story picked up in July after the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decision upholding the validity of Netlist’s U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent that applies to DDR server memory modules. The decision is final and binding on future cases and represents a resounding win for Netlist. The (‘912) patent is a seminal patent; an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. This ruling has much larger implications than just GOOG which will more than likely set the tone for other settlements long overdue here. Netlist holds a portfolio of patents including over 130 issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents, many seminal, in the areas of hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication and load reduction, among others. The Company’s sales are on a steep rise; Net sales for the third quarter ended September 26, 2020 were $10.2 million, compared to net sales of $6.1 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2019."
