wlf73u|hj7ixd|hj7ixd|18|So what is the end goal here? It seems to me like a big motivation for propping up equities was that boomers need to be able to retain their wealth because they all are heavily exposed to equities and even a 3-5 year bear market would wipe out retirements and bankrupt the US. Social security is not able to function as a sole source of income considering people are living longer.  But at these prices, who the hell are they selling to when they retire and/or need cash to live?  Eventually there needs to be a greater fool right?   I don't see how young people straddled with student loans and low wages are going to be able to hold this thing up when the time comes.  Edit:  And considering the trend of dividends and fixed income, it's not like granny can keep collecting. She's got to dump her square, Tesla, and Google on someone.|2020-07-01 11:02:59

About 11.9 million Americans who are unemployed as a result of the pandemic, or about 7.2% of the workforce, have no hope of returning to their old jobs, while 5.7 million workers, or 3.5% of people, expect to get called back to work but probably won’t, writes [Heidi Shierholz](https://www.epi.org/people/heidi-shierholz/), senior economist and director of policy at EPI. That puts the share of the workforce currently out of work with no reasonable chance of returning to their jobs at roughly 11%, or about 17.6 million people.  “It is likely that many of those who expect to be called back to their jobs will find that those furloughs have turned into permanent layoffs,” Shierholz says. |2020-07-01 11:42:46

Not the ones carefully planned and thought out like the ones folks bought yesterday thinking there would be a huge dip based on the crazy run up yesterday.   TSLA is heavily reliant on the news. It went to 950-ish last week because articles were coming out about being incredibly overvalued and other news about flaws in the cars. Guess what Elon decides? "Hmm, I need to "leak" an email to convince folks to buy into shares again".   If their sales are worse than expected, expect a huge tumble. If not, hello 1300.|2020-07-01 13:34:28

wm02lg|hj7ixd|hj7ixd|10|" Risk asset prices were buoyed by optimism about the potential for increased economic activity associated with reopenings as parts of the United States and other countries relaxed lockdown restrictions. That optimism was reinforced by high-frequency data suggesting a pickup in economic activity. Market participants also pointed to the suite of U.S. and global policy measures taken since mid-March as laying a foundation for the improvement in risk sentiment. Against this backdrop, staff analysis suggested that equity prices had been supported by expectations for a strong rebound in earnings next year, low risk-free rates and positive risk sentiment.

wm0qh4|hj7ixd|hj7ixd|21| How fucked up is TECH? TSLA is now worth more than Toyota. TSLA's production and profit is a rounding error on Toyota's balance sheet. Toyo's finance arm prints money, and so does their insurance, parts and service departments. On a zoomed out graph, you wouldn't even be able to see the profit from these parts of TSLA. IDGAF how good your tech is, when Toyo is the originator of the most successful hybrid on the planet, and has the capability to make better machines, it just doesn't add up. NKLA is worth more than Ford and Nissan, and regardless of the comparison, will soon edge out Honda as well, without ever putting out a product. CVNA, one of the worst cash incinerators in the market is at ATH. Wayfair which had its place in the App Store peak at 8, is now almost out of the top 100, yet it's valuation has doubled from it's pre-covid high.   NKLA is worth more than Honda.  VRM, a CVNA clone is worth almost as much as Honda, and more than Nissan/ Ford.  This shit is pure greed.  TSLA fanboys STFU about a Semi that's not in existence and that literally no major company will purchase.|2020-07-01 13:47:43

NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 76.2% (0.26% average gain). No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 21 years."|2020-07-01 09:14:39

wlg1oa|hj7ixd|hj7ixd|4| This morning, Rosehill gave “investors” a good look at what happens in bankruptcy, in case you missed CHK, and is a great reminder that cases like Whiting were the exception and not the rule.     What happened? “The RSA provides that, following consummation of the Plan, the Company's equity will be owned solely by the Consenting Creditors and holders of the Company's preferred stock.” For clarity they added this sentence. “Additionally, the RSA provides that, pursuant to the Plan, the Company's Class A Common Stock and other common equity securities will be extinguished.”     Will Rosehill continue to exist? Yes. Produce assets and have challenged drilling inventory? Yes. BUT the “common equity” is officially worthless.     And herein lies the point to remember when I say: “you can’t own oil and gas company stock”. It’s not about transitioning the grid, it’s not about being negative on the industry. It’s that so many companies will declare bankruptcy and their shares will be worth 0.     That’s why hedge funds are buying the debt and driving the decision to wipe out the equity. Owning the debt is the best way to buy the asset since at <$40, most companies have assets that are worth less than their outstanding debt.     Do the work. Don’t get caught holding the bag.|2020-07-01 11:09:50

wm9t8o|hj7ixd|hj7ixd|2|TSLA 7/10 1000P  Someone talk me off the ledge  "Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent one of his characteristic  motivational emails to all employees at his electric vehicle company on  Monday around noon California time.  In the email, which was  shared with CNBC, he urged workers to “go all out” with vehicle  production and deliveries, and told them that “breaking even is looking  super tight.”  It’s  not clear whether “breaking even” was referring to the company’s profit  margin, which may require it to sell a certain number of vehicles  during the quarter, or another metric, like production numbers versus  expectations or previous quarters’ figures.  Tesla is expected to report its second quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers this week, before the 4th of July weekend."  If he's concerned about just breaking even, I don't think we're going to see a huge beat.|2020-07-01 14:55:29

Imagine designing a fuckin motion sensor for soap dispensers and it can’t pick up black people hands.   That shit *happened*. I’m sure it didn’t fuck that soap dispenser company too bad, but in another industry where people actually review your product it sure as shit could. Fuck “racism”, shit literally didn’t work for a large group of people, why the fuck would they buy your product. Now you gotta redesign. Scrap any unsold product currently in inventory. Do you supply businesses? Oh great, they may want refunds or recalls/replacement.   Do you know how fucking tight I would be that my designers didn’t pick that up during pre-production/production?

The crooks have been making free money apparantly.  https://i.imgur.com/Re6GN6W.jpg   DKNGW was halted at 7:30 est, only 2 days too late NASDAQ.
