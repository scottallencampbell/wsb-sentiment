And last time it set up for a relief rally like that it hit the very top of the possible run.  Range seems too wide to chop like this for long. It's relief rally or a big leg down.   Bear thesis: fundamentals are shit, september was the last month we could really expect inflation to have slowed its only pain into the cold months and escalation of the war. China is signaling they're big mad about the chip sanctions and they've been pushed pretty far lately (but they REALLY don't seem to want the smoke.) Not that it matters, but COVID is surging again. Earnings are likely to be a dud. There are still TWO potential currency crises just waiting to pop off (Japan and England.)   Bull thesis: lol it's going up. I asked Santa and there's midterms coming. There's an absolutely historic dollar value in retail puts for MMs to annihilate. They WILL teach us a lesson.    TL;DR 3 week expiry 385 calls.
