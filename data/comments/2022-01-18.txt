Of course, with how many people try to buy dips, who knows if we get down to that level.  Still we did get to that 25-30% pullback level in 2018 and in previous small cap retraces.

To reach historical 'cheap' levels we would be looking at a 75% drop from here. 🧸  https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php  --  *Did you know???*  **The CAPE Ratio**:By the Shiller CAPE measure the US market would need to fall a little more than 50% to get to the average again. To reach historical 'cheap' levels, we would be looking at a 75% drop from here. 🧸  https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe  --  *Did you know???*  **Market dividend yield**: If we see a 1.5-2.5% rise in interest rates and the market dividend yield increases similarly, the US market is looking at a 50% drop from here. To reach the levels that were achieved historically to control inflation, we would need a 75% drop in the SP500 from here. 🧸  --   *Did you know???*  **Price to Sales Ratio**: Sales tend to be a lot more stable than earnings over long periods so they are a useful standard candle by which to measure overvaluation. The SP500 price to sales is 3.2 just now. The historical average is around 1.60 depending on which measure you take. The low is 0.8. This implies a 50% drop in the SP500 from here to get back to historical average valuation, or a 75% drop if we revisit historical lows. 🧸  ---  Click [HERE](https://www.worldanimalprotection.us/blogs/5-facts-about-bears) to get extra BEAR FACTS!   or type I-WANT-MORE-BEAR-FACTS-PLEASE to unsubscribe. 🧸|2022-01-18 11:53:19

As she takes the weight of you in her hand, your mind wanders. To your puts. They’ll expire worthless, like you.

I just got approved for options trading on ThinkOrSwim (I WONT use Robin Hood because they’re run by the evil hedgies!!) <boos the bad guys>  I just bought some GME options. I think it’s called calls <giggles>. It’s the option you buy when you want the stonk to go up up up! <this is fun!>  I went and found some that were inexpensive. Like two cents a share or something.   Can you all help me figure this out? <nervously hoping the apes will accept me>  There are a bunch of numbers in my purchase that I don’t understand.  Here’s what it says “1/21 $605C $0.02”  How do I make money on this? <smiles in Lambo and Diamond hands to the moon!>|2022-01-18 09:38:44

t71brw|s6uy8h|s6uy8h|6|  Up 53% with this strategy so far this year  Identify shit companies that are likely to go down, like Pton, hood, arkk, ect. Find around 10 of em. Have puts on these companies make up around 50% of portfolio  25% of portfolio in spy calls or companies that you feel will go up  25% of portfolio in oil plays  What I’ve noticed: spy red, your shit companies print big, oil prints, offset by some call loses still profit  Spy green, roughly half your shit companies still print while the others go up so you break even on puts. Oil prints, and spy calls print and you still profit   Ordered a new boat for delivery next year, told them I already have the money, so this better continue to work|2022-01-18 10:41:43

Only reason why I don't like them.  1) They ran up way too much already, almost 20% in 1-2 months.  2) They're balls deep in AAPL which is solid but will underperform in the near-term.  Safe but probably not mega green.  3) They have massive cat exposure.

However, she just got Covid exposed again, so work, following the CDC guidelines, is asking her to quarantine 5 days because of exposure. With cases being what they are, there is a good chance she gets exposed yet again within those 5 days.|2022-01-18 08:06:27

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.|2022-01-18 09:46:45

t7zp3q|s6uy8h|s6uy8h|-7|My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.|2022-01-18 14:12:52
