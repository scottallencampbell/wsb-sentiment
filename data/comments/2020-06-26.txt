Rebalancing: Quarterly rebalancing folks, it‚Äôs beginning to happen / happening; stock prices higher so percentage wise they automatically switch to bonds to even it up.

w2ji5q|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|6|Tip to time the right moment to "buy the dip" (only applicable if you have PDT) is that if after you buy the call, if it continues to drop, IMMEDIATELY sell another call with +$0.5/1 strike price on the same date, gets the refund and wait till the next sign of reversal and repeat. If it starts pumping up, IMMEDIATELY buy to close all those short calls earlier and enjoy the +100%. If not, short those calls back again and wait. Thank me later|2020-06-26 10:23:49

w2ezdc|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|10|The year is 2058. For 38 years, SPY has vacillated between 300 and 320. As you stare off into the distance, you feel a tug at your sleeve. It's your grandson. "Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy.

But SPY at 300+ doesn't accurately reflect the second lockdown.|2020-06-26 10:01:14

w30r9f|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|6|I‚Äôm not criticising the accuracy of the statement, but the semantics of it. Science is the absolutely closest thing we can get to ‚Äúcertainty‚Äù, since true randomness is incredibly complex, true certainty must therefore also be incredibly complex.   There is no such thing as a fact-based naturally occurring truth that can warrant 100% certain foresight because nobody knows what‚Äôs going to happen in the future, but science is the one thing that we can use to measure and try to prepare for what MIGHT happen based on what HAS happened and therefore COULD happen based on testing a variety of different circumstances, thus allowing for the advancement of theoretical models.  I understand my original comment may not have conveyed my thoughts accurately, I was just baffled by the statement, because science is the one closest thing in life we have to certainty, therefore saying ‚Äúthere are no certainties in science‚Äù, is like, well yeah dude, but everything else is literally speculation, anything not achieved through observation and experimentation is speculation, therefore not even in the same category, up to probability, and in no way a reliable reference, so we can‚Äôt compare the accuracy of science to any other field.|2020-06-26 12:41:17

If the Federal government were publicly traded it'd be a penny stock one scandal away from being delisted and CEOs going to prison.

w2kb34|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|4|If y'all have the patience and want a not-so-wild play, keep an eye on the NFL. If there's even a whiff of the potential for the season to be scaled back or cancelled, CBS has the rights to the Super Bowl this year (on top of all the other football and March Madness). Should those two be in danger of being cancelled or some form of controversy around playing the game without fans then Viacom could be in for a bad time. I wouldn't recommend puts today since they're down so much but if they pop back into the 24+ area getting December puts in the high teens could pay off.     The NFL being as greedy as they are I doubt the game or season gets cancelled but there is a looming possibility of it.|2020-06-26 10:30:33

See that there's a floor of buyers and that there's a roof of sellers. Volatility ensues and we test bottoms and we retest highs. And follow the Nasdaq/Spy for those levels.   Portfolio up 70% for the week being a Kang, Bull, and Bear.  Positions: Spy puts when Nasdaq double tops ATH, Fastly/Docu/Spot calls when Nasdaq double bottoms.

My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the fact that SPY is going down in pre market. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is it going down during a depression? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I just want my calls to print. I want SPY to get to 350 EOD. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought I was going to be a millionaire???? This is so fucked.|2020-06-26 08:03:48

w2u9yi|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|11|The boomer exit strategy was always to sell their shit houses for like 50x what they bought them for in 1985 and use the cash to buy more liquid assets like stocks so they can cash out as needed for cruises and healthcare and such (while those stocks kept appreciating in value). Except, as with all things boomer, their peanut brains nowhere near cover for their rapacious greed. Now theyre stuck with assets nobody wants to buy (at their delusional valuations) and the Fed has prematurely pumped stocks and left boomers priced out. No cruises for you, gramps  Boomers being greedy and dumb, they'll vote themselves a real estate bailout at the cost of dismantling the state except for the military and buy in at the top of the stock market anyway, which will be the signal for Wall Street whales to sell everything and unleash the giga dump. One silver lining is boomers will live to see the last shreds of their wealth evaporate in a dumpocaust of daily -10% candles which will make the March massacre look like babytown frolics|2020-06-26 11:49:59

w2fxrc|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|2|ill say it again.. DKNGüëë INSIDE INFO:   Donkey Kong had a Public Offering to issue millions of new shares the other week, big one actually and plenty of execs sold off shares. Don't let the fake news fool you. Insiders sold because of this offering.   Funny that it happened right around when warrants expire, tomorrow at 5pm.   See this ‚û°Ô∏è https://i.imgur.com/K1BTGor.png  It's common.   With their warrants expiring today at 5, you can saythe beach ball will finally pop up out of water and the stock will rise.   Today was one of the best buying opportunities you would have gotten on the stock, but it's pullback still maintains awesome value.  Here's the big boys trick. They short the stock into warrant expiration to get the best buy price.  See this snippet‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://imgur.com/a/fHdQG8e   Analysts fool retail by publicating buy ratings and increased price targets near the expiration.  The other day was a $55 buy upgrade, last week was a $50 one and tonight was a $60 buy upgrade.  They are shorting the stock up until eod only to buy cheap and enjoy the ride.   See this‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://imgur.com/a/ynsXuEH   Dillution at DKNG ends in under 8 hours so if you don't buy DKNG tomorrow, you ain't black.|2020-06-26 09:53:32

w1z3x2|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|8|Markets seems to have priced in the idea that the US won't close again. I guarantee if the death rate spikes there is no way they can justify staying open. Not full lockdown, no one can afford that again, but cities will lockdown - public pressure will be far too much. Its when deaths exponentially grow and the fear strikes that governments will have no choice. - I'm sure anyone who lives in New York will testify, I was in London when the first wave hits and shit got crazy.  It's strange but the thing that makes the US such an economic powerhouse: freedom of movement, semi-independent states, individualism, crony capitalism, light-touch government, low workers rights, low welfare provisions. Seem to be the worst possible conditions for a coherent pandemic response - much smaller and more centralised European countries are performing much better. Whereas the decentralised and US-like UK has also performed badly, specifically England - tellingly the smaller countries in the UK have performed very well too.|2020-06-26 07:04:56

I'm okay with spending more than 1500 if it's more stable.   Normally I'd buy some OTM (maybe 285)14-18dte spy puts, but they are super expensive right now.  VXX calls? SPXL puts? SQQQ calls?

w1x79q|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|4|Tale of three Murican Dukes!  Three Dukes, vying for the favor of the King, see who can sacrifice the peasants in the realm rather than call the King a liar.   The Dukes each had many chances to stop a great plague. Other Dukes told them ‚Äúthis plague is terrible. People die. Many suffer. But you can prevent it. Wear the masks. Be careful.‚Äù But the King said there was nothing to worry about. And so they laughed off the other Dukes.   One Duke decides to let the plague roam over his swampy lands and beaches. But instead of plague, he records each death as ‚Äútummy ache.‚Äù The King likes that.  That Duke has a faithful servant who builds a ‚Äúportal‚Äù so that the plague can be understood by ‚Äúscientists‚Äù (very unwelcome in the kingdom).  The second Duke with the big hat & the not so smart Lieutenant Duke decided that all the elders must perish so oil could flow & shopping could commence at ‚Äúthe Galleria.‚Äù The second Duke allows the beds to fill & fill with people with the plague. He may be worried but then again he loves freedom. And he wants to be the King‚Äôs favorite.  The third Duke lives in the desert. He was building a giant wall for the King. With the other dukes, he laughed at the ‚Äúpeasants‚Äù saying the plague wasn‚Äôt bad in the desert. People in the realm begged and pleaded. Begged and pleaded that there would be no place to put all the sick people. Even as the hospitals filled, the Duke puffed up his chest & welcomed the King to come & help the plague spread. He was pretty happy to show how much he looked down on other people.|2020-06-26 06:40:11

Sell for a 200$ loss and pick up some puts, make up that difference in an hour.  Ohhh you are hardcore bear gang and your puts are expiring like your monthly grinder membership? Cool, get mounted and then buy a call and reverse those gay trends.  You noobs are either going broke, or gunna learn during The Rectoming. Either way you better be okay with losing money.

The currently established death test of COVID is roughly 5%. In reality, if testing captured 100% of subjects it‚Äôs probably closer to 2%.

w1smi9|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|2|PTON aug 90c and oct 80c if you‚Äôre a logically sound individual   This tidbit from an interview with NYU professor Aswath Damodaran was eye opening:   In September, when I valued it, I thought it didn't really merit the price it went for.  But times have changed because of Covid-19.  Every crisis creates winners. It creates a winner in Peloton, but only if Peloton takes advantage of a very different business model.  How so?  My wife, [who] would never spend $40 a month for any subscription, paid $12 a month to get the Peloton low-price subscription, which you could use on any exercise bike. And she loved it. Maybe coming out of this, Peloton will have a mass subscription model where you forget about the equipment, which is an expensive, low-margin business, and you make it all about subscriptions. So I think Peloton has a chance now.|2020-06-26 05:32:45

w32axf|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|2|BTW, subsequent analysis of every countries' excess deaths show that the actual covid-19 death count was probably understated by at least 50% in most places.  Bananastans are understating by multiples, and China is basically LARPing they don't have covid-19 as they get eaten alive. It's absolutely crazy the propaganda snow job that was done on covid-19 IMO.  Multiple states are overwhelmed and 2 weeks behind the curve. These are the states that will also fall apart when overwhelmed, and have trouble with the citizens complying with reasonable orders.  Shutdown again is inevitable.|2020-06-26 12:53:18

My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Fed kept the market pumping despite the worst economic news in decades. But that all changed when the Bear Nation attacked. Only the Chair of the Federal Reserve mastered all four printers. Only he could stop the ruthless bears. But when the market needed him most, he vanished.  80 minutes have passed and the Bear Nation is nearing victory in the War. Five minutes ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to Robinhood to help fight against the Bear Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after the $4 left in our checking account. Some people believe that the printer ran out of ink, and that the cycle is broken. But I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow, JPow will return to save the market.|2020-06-26 09:49:56

Iron Condor spreads are amazing for uncertain times like this. You limit your profit, but when things swing wildly in either direction, you‚Äôre GUARANTEED a profit. It‚Äôs won‚Äôt be big, maybe like $300 to $700 in a day or two. But that‚Äôs just for one Iron Condor. This scales pretty well.|2020-06-26 14:47:57

w2448h|hg4wdd|hg4wdd|1|So it‚Äôs unlikely that we get Lockdown 2: Revenge of the Bat AIDS, but the odds are that we see rollbacks in some of the openings across multiple states. This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if it were smaller states, but we‚Äôre talking about Texas, California, and Florida, at the very least. Seems like a retest of the lows from 5/14 would be in order, at least for non-tech names. The banks could easily have an 8-10% pullback and they‚Äôd all still be fairly valued at those levels and given the current conditions. Ditto consumer discretionary names. So if you think there‚Äôs a drop coming don‚Äôt be an asshole and buy SPY 220p for 7/17 and then cry that the market is rigged when you get socket-fucked. Just go back to mid May, look at the prices, and adjust your bets accordingly.   Anyway, here‚Äôs Wonderwall.|2020-06-26 08:02:47

Trump and Jpow were forming a super V...so the cabal was scrambling to crash us again...they thought about releasing murder hornets, but went with starting a race war instead.  All attempts to get rid of Trump.   kung flu meant no Trump rallies, no debates with Joe B, also a reason to keep Joe B behind doors and ultimately to get mail in ballots to secure stealing the election from Trump.
