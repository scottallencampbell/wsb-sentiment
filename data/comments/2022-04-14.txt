4oq5wk|u3dunn|u3dunn|9|Reminder: This is a real Cathie Wood quote from the exact week ARKK tanked. *  "I founded the company out of faith. I got this calling one day when I walked into my home. It was a beautiful summer day. I walked in to complete silence, which was very unusual in my household at that time. The children were all gone to Christian camps and other activities. And so I was all alone for the first time ever in my house, all alone for two full weeks. And I walked over to the kitchen island and I wasn’t happy and I wasn’t sad. I was just, *Wow, this has never happened to me before.*  As soon as I said that to myself, I felt a *wham* and I really feel like that was the Holy Spirit just saying to me, “Okay, this is the plan.” And the idea was basically, “**Look, you’ve been a student of disruptive innovation your entire career. Why don’t you disrupt your own industry? It’s broken. Why do you disrupt it with some of these new technologies? Why don’t you harness social media? Why don’t you invite people in—even your competitors—to brainstorm about these new ideas, to help spread the word?**” And so I did that, and it’s been amazing. It’s so much better than anything that I could have possibly imagined.   I funded it for the first three years all by myself. And for the first three years, our assets didn’t grow that much. And I thought, \*Oh my goodness, what have I done?\*Every two weeks there was an exit of a significant amount of my wealth into the company. And I would kneel down and say, “**Okay, God, You’re in control. Even if this company fails, I know I’ve done the right thing. This is a walk of faith for me. Your will be done.**”"  source: [https://www.jesuscalling.com/podcast/surviving-and-thriving-to-help-gods-children-victoria-damone-catherine-wood/](https://www.jesuscalling.com/podcast/surviving-and-thriving-to-help-gods-children-victoria-damone-catherine-wood/)|2022-04-14 06:16:54

Hard to see how it can go up all that much further, US government cannot afford 3+% yields for an extended period of time..., would basically be forced to default through printing at some point in the next decade or two.  Bond markets are screaming recession in the next year, but stocks don't look all that convinced.  Not the first time we've seen this wide divergence (all of 2021 was a huge divergence with stocks rocketing on a presumed multi-year boom while bonds warned of high inflation that would kneecap growth).  Bonds were proven right on 2021 earlier this year, will likely be right about the next year too.|2022-04-14 12:07:05

But it is muddled by the fact that prices are going up too.  Either this is demand destruction or consumers have reached their breaking point and will spend less, which will kneecap GDP growth. The Fed has a very fine needle to thread between causing good demand destruction to tame inflation and setting off a full blown recession.  The only thing supporting GDP now are restaurants, lol.

4orkah|u3dunn|u3dunn|5|TWTR puts is probably the way to go if this battle goes hostile and Musk raises his offer at least once.  Just hard to see the current management agreeing to this buyout offer given it's antithetical to how they run the company.  They'll probably adopt some form of a poison pill and attempt to create/dump 100-300 million new shares on the public to water down Musk's stake and make it more expensive for him to take it over.  And if that happens, the stock will end up at $30 or less if Musk decides to withdraw from the takeover battle.  A long ways to go here most likely, but I wouldn't hold calls or stock in TWTR if this turns hostile.|2022-04-14 06:31:46

But you also gotta factor in price increases, which means a very weak/muddled picture of consumer spending that is the main driver of the economy.   PCE numbers out for today:  https://www.bea.gov/news/2022/personal-income-and-outlays-february-2022  *Real PCE decreased 0.4 percent; goods decreased 2.1 percent and services increased 0.6 percent (tables 5 and 7).*  Maybe the story that inflation has peaked will gain traction due to demand destruction, but it could teeter on the brink of a contraction in GDP that will mean a recession if demand for goods keeps imploding this much.|2022-04-14 08:50:18

And now, do you really think they will sell it to Elon who’s supposedly a champion for “free speech”? (Aka from the left point of view - for misgendering, election fraud, baby eating blood cult conspiracies, and bring back Donald Trump?)Absolutely not happening in a 100 years.

Either this is the demand destruction that will cool inflation, or it portends slowing GDP growth that's gonna lead to a recession or stagflation.

4p1i19|u3dunn|u3dunn|2|The answer for why bank account interest rates remain low:  "Tumin says the online savings-account rates are up only slightly from last year’s lows of 0.45%, because deposit rates have held above the Fed’s short-term target rate, now pegged at a range of 0.25% to 0.5%, for a while now, meaning there’s little reason to boost yields above that range. What’s more, banks have few incentives now to offer attractive deposit rates because they’ve been flush with funds since the earliest days of the pandemic. "  And there it is. Short term rate remains low while the rest of the curve climbs, and banks are greedy fuckers.|2022-04-14 08:02:14

No fucking shit inflation will peak, no one expects it to go up for forever. Wake me up when inflation actually goes down though.  Inflation that doesn't go up but stays flat and persists still sucks.  It will cause stagflation which will shave off big GDP growth going forward.  US will just turn into a shitty zombie economy that relies on restaurants to grow GDP. Lol.|2022-04-14 11:23:35

Either way, he's a genius for making this move.  He can buy up 5-10% of any company and then attempt a takeover at a 30-40% premium while threatening to dump his stake at a huge profit if it doesn't work out...; he's created a guaranteed win scenario.  If you have stock or calls in TWTR, now is the time to sell; this thing probably can only go down if it turns into a takeover fight.  Doubt Musk will chase it into the $60+ range; he'd probably just dump his stake at that level.|2022-04-14 06:08:48

4pbun5|u3dunn|u3dunn|0|Elon will get Twitter no matter what. It's brilliant: he buys a 10% stake, then makes an offer to buy 100%. If they take the offer, he owns Twitter, so he already won. But if they reject the offer, the price will tank due to his "threat" to "reconsider his position as a shareholder". So then when the price is down 20-30%, he swoops in and buys another 10% or 20% of twitter. Now he owns 30%. Now he makes another offer to buy 100%. But at this point it hardly matters, he will be able to outvote anyone (with some help) and install a new CEO etc. He will change twitter no matter what happens.|2022-04-14 09:19:17

Will it be unlikely for Twitter’s price to go beyond $55 since $54.2 is what’s being offered?

4p3y4w|u3dunn|u3dunn|-5|Your grandfather told you this was how they buried Koreans in the war. Sometimes alive. That's where you got the idea. You remember how wide-eyed you were when he told you that story. You also remember your mother wincing at the finer details being shared with her seven-year-old son. The moment was tucked into a permanent part of your memory.  In the pink dawn light, you look down at the chain wrapped around your ankles, legs, and waist. The other end of the chain is wrapped through several cinder blocks carefully resting on the edge of the bridge. You look out across the water and sigh. You took your wife to this place on one of your first dates. You both laughed at the other picnickers--teasing the way they flirted and interacted--as if you both weren't also falling into a silly, sappy love.  Even now, at the end, you instinctually look at your phone. Or perhaps it's not instinct, just a final prayer. You see the market is still flat. That won't save your far out-of-the-money Tesla puts. That won't save your life savings. That won't save you.  You tap the top cinder block with your toe. As you fall toward the water, you notice a dark shape gliding across the water. Beautifully, calmly. *What was that?* you ask the air bubbles floating away from you. *A black swan?*|2022-04-14 08:21:17

4p01zd|u3dunn|u3dunn|1|I thought a while ago (around the time MSFT was buying LinkedIn) that Google was the most natural buyer for TWTR.  Still think that's the case in terms of utility (more combination of Twitter results/Google search and putting together some form of collaboration between Twitter and Youtube still makes sense) but obviously Google has so many anti-trust issues right now with Android/search/ad market share, it's hard to see how they'd ever get approval to buy TWTR at this point.  Hard to see any other bidders; TWTR is more trouble than it's worth to everyone else.  They're probably going to look for every possible defense, but short of somebody like Marc Benioff (Salesforce) being willing to take a giant risk, hard to see any obvious white knight here, especially at $60+ per share.|2022-04-14 07:50:20

4p7wie|u3dunn|u3dunn|1|The good thing about $TSM is that they are investing bigly in CapEx (I think 30B?) to fulfill current and future needs. On top of that, production yields are constantly increasing. Datacenter spending will be at all time highs for IaaS providers like GOOG, MSFT that posted 40% yoy increase in datacenter revenues. Even AMD reported 40% increase in datacenter revenue. [Take a look at Applied Materials projection of Data Generation.](https://i.imgur.com/GSAKX2h.jpeg) You want to be selling shovels (semis) to the gold miners (tech), especially with gross margins of 55%+.  Political risk surrounds TSM where lot of retail doesn't understand that China isn't gonna invade Taiwan. They have more problems to deal with than trigger a bunch of countries reliant on Taiwan. Plus, if China attacks Taiwan, then all surrounding countries such as Japan and South Korea would start weaponizing. Do you think China wants to deal with this when they have a slowing economy, property crisis, and COVID? They're literally on the brink of giving stimmies.  Also, Biden's chips act isn't just for American companies, it's to build foundries IN AMERICA. TSM is likely to get a piece of this pie as well, given their expertise.|2022-04-14 08:50:45

The unintended consequence for higher rates, however, mean would be sellers will no longer list homes for sale, because sellers are now also unable to afford a new home if they want to move.  That means supply will still keep drying up and keep prices elevated despite rocketing mortgage rates. People who were considering $750k-$1M homes will now just start buying up more and more $500-700k homes to compensate for the interest rate.  First time buyers are still gonna be fucked.  There's really no solution until supplies are increased.  Housing is caught in a catch 22.|2022-04-14 09:39:18
