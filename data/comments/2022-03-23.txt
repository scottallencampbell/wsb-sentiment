1sn5hw|tkqhif|tkqhif|34|I met Ryan Cohen 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old  niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the  waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but Ryan himself.   I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was  sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say  anything to him.   Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I’m trying to  quiet her down because I didn’t want her to bother Ryan, but she  wouldn’t stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over.   He started running  his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she  was probably hungry or something. So Ryan put down his phone, picked up  my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the  middle of the barbershop.   Chill guy, really nice about it.|2022-03-23 08:58:09

1s3i1v|tkqhif|tkqhif|11|The year is 2058. The daily news is being read to your thoughts by your iMind when you mentally whisper *Stop.*  "No more lollygagging, you two." You put down your coffee and throw your hands up in exaggerated frustration. You scold your son Elon for not finishing his breakfast as he jumps up from the kitchen table. He and his sister Elona are off to school. You watch as they walk into the next room, lie down in their education chambers, and plug their minds into their virtual classroom. The embossed white and red GameStop logo on their helmets catches the morning light coming through the window, and you glance outside.  Your ride quietly waits for you in the driveway, ready--as it is seven days a week--to take you to work. Before you board the Tesla, you decide to clean up the remnants of Elon's breakfast so your wife won't have to when she finishes her OnlyFans shift. She was recently drafted into service by the U.S. Army, to join the other women working to improve morale among the soldiers entrenched in Russia.  You wince at the sight of Elon's uneaten toast. That's seven or eight million dollars of wheat down the drain. With a sigh, you walk out the front door.|2022-03-23 06:05:34

Before it tops it has to hit bottom. Most think 430 was the bottom but it’s completely possible that it was not. The tea leaves say spy 400 by April 14th. Followed by the most bull run you have ever seen to the top of 500-530 by august/ September. The market will then go into recession. An actual bear market from 530 down about 40-50% crash.

Having the fed meeting out of the way cured some of that and allowed us to rally this much but I don’t think this is a systemic, fundamental change in perspective happening, I think it’s more so just a manic “green pullback/reversion to the mean” rally on the temporary removal of uncertainty.|2022-03-23 13:28:27

1sc5e6|tkqhif|tkqhif|2|Total loss of Russian oil won't be seen until end of April – Trafigura 23 Mar 2022 12:13 LAUSANNE, March 23 (Reuters) – Trafigura's co-head of oil said the market could see crude hit $150 a barrel this summer and that the total loss of Russian oil would become clearer in April. "I think you will see record backwardation and you will see $150 a barrel this summer," Trafigura's Ben Luckock told the FT Commodities Global Summit, adding that north of $200 was also possible. Backwardation is a market structure where the front month is higher than the following, which can signal tight supplies. "You'll know at the end of April what the total loss of Russian oil is. As it stands right now, there's a vast amount of Russian oil there...Russians have cancelled crude cargoes and stored some (that haven't sold)."|2022-03-23 07:32:13

This sub is filled with apes who are claiming to have made tons of money on GME, even though statistically, most of them have lost money given that GME has gone from $500 to $140.  So, start replying "positions or ban" to any ape claiming to have struck it rich, and follow up with the mods when they don't. Make these dumbasses be honest or get banned.|2022-03-23 06:26:18

1sjsya|tkqhif|tkqhif|0|He sees you there. Quiet. Solemn. Cross-armed clutching your shoulders, coyly hiding your bare chest. The candlelight flickers revealing your crooked smile. There's a dampness in the air. It feels like an August evening in the bayou. The moisture condenses on the small of your back as it slides down into your deep crevice. He takes a step forward and you immediately gasp and turn slightly away. He approaches and gently places his hand on your left knee, pulling it apart from your right. He leans in and whispers softly into your ear, "naked shorts, right?" Just as your small wee wee stands at attention, the chairman grabs ahold. "Who is your dad?" he forcefully mouths under his breath. With no other option but to give yourself to him, your arms relax and lower from their defensive position. You brush his hair away from his brow and scream out, almost in relief, almost in ecstasy. "Ryan Cohen is my dad!"|2022-03-23 08:33:58

Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated. Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming. GameStop is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming. this GameStop earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and i believe Amazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to GameStop. so what do they have to do with each other? competitors and GameStops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.|2022-03-23 11:09:44
