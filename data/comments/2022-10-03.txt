Before the October low in 2002, there was a +4.87% one day rally 7 trading days before the bottom. It then went on to drop 10.14% in those 7 days. Seven days from now  puts the bottom on Oct 12th, 2022. As, I've already stated many times already  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqmq3e/what\_are\_your\_moves\_tomorrow\_september\_29\_2022/iqc57pk/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqmq3e/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_september_29_2022/iqc57pk/?context=3)  Not to mention, my She-Hulk DD has been dead on, for ever episode but one. Including the release of the 7th episode on the 29th which correctly predicted the massive drop on Friday. As we know the final episode is released on Oct 13th, and should allow the market to finally bottom and go higher.

It is days like this that should teach you to not buy short dated puts. 3 months out at minimum. Also why you take profits consistently so you have cash to take advantage of cheaper entries.  Do these simple things and you will grow to be a big ole grizzly like me.  Most important, however, is bear markets do not last forever and 99% hate them. Don't be dogmatic. Know your levels and swing bullish when the market gives you the signs.

They changed their unspoken short day from Friday to Monday.which explains why the Friday sell-off was virtually unopposed by the Squeezers.  Timed with announcers across most websites hailing the rally across all sectors, in the face of no good news across almost all sectors, that gives away the nature of the rally.  Finance sector pundits started speculating over the weekend that the economy is so bad that the Fed must pivot in short order.  So there you have it.  The stock market is so bad as of Sunday that they say the Fed must pivot to lower interest rates to avoid crashing the economy.  Thus the market rally must be because of the anticipated pivot, not because of the strong economy. All the news today ignore the real reason for the rally.  Thus, the ultimatum of wall street to the Fed to pivot - must have been effective, though yet unacknowledged by the Fed.  But until it is announced, the Fed may still be forced to raise rates further as the high prices of everything could result in a midterm election upheaval in Congress, and thus, the crash could resume.  All it takes is for Powell to say that the rates will keep rising until inflation is down to 2%, and this Pivot Anticipation Rally will Peter out as it should, since raising rates eventually is unavoidable to prevent worsening inflation.  More delay in raising rates means the higher the final interest rate target will have to be, as the inflation rate will keep rising.  If the Fed can be cajoled into delaying any rate hike, this will be the last time it can kick the can down the road, because by November, it will RUN OUT OF ROAD.|2022-10-03 13:44:59qvahti|xuf428|xuf428|0|bottom's in|2022-10-03 06:03:15qvhciq|xuf428|xuf428|0|#Bears, LMFAO!|2022-10-03 07:15:05qvjlme|xuf428|xuf428|0|currently at Lowes shopping with my wife's boyfriend for a shovel to bur(r)y some bulls with this morning|2022-10-03 07:36:04qvk1aj|xuf428|xuf428|0|When bears get cocky, just remember this...
