tf6ldg|cbfc3z|cbfc3z|9|Theory:  It seems big investment companies are collectively toning down expectations for 2019 (see MS downgrading global equities from outperform and GS and others putting a 3000 target on S&P end of year while recognizing downside risk). But for huge players to get out of stock positions they need volume. Which we just haven‚Äôt had.   That‚Äôs where earnings comes into play. And this could be why Pepsi dropped despite beating expectations and setting solid guidance. They need the volume that comes from ER type events to slowly decrease massive positions.   If today is high volume due to Powell, could get ugly. And if the theory holds, it could be a bad earnings season. August 16 puts are the play my friends!|2019-07-10 07:28:53

tgjrt4|cbfc3z|cbfc3z|3|For people who love buying the DIP.  $AVGO: Currently trading at 274.5  * **Patiently wait** for selling exhaustion. This would be seen on the daily candle as a hammer candle.  * Currently both RSI and STO on the daily is pointing towards selling exhaustion. Give it a a couple of days or even next week. **Let them dip into heavy oversold!** * Its already under 8,20 and 50EMA on the daily. 200EMA is around 266. * **There is a massive green candle on the 4h on 18th June which is currently under test**. The bottom of this candle is 267.  My DD: Wait until 266-268 area and then go long on AVGO September 300calls. If AVGO plummets to 267 from here..they should be around 150-200$ each contract. Buy half size here. Incase it goes down and you don't want to sell, add more at 257 area.  **Since expiry is way out, set a stop loss of around 30-40% which is fine.**|2019-07-10 16:01:56

tf5il0|cbfc3z|cbfc3z|3|It might be too much for /r/wsb simpletons that think the game is about whether fed cuts in july (spoiler: it does, nobody cares) but here's an interesting article:  &#x200B;  >**Traders Are Certain Fed Will Cut in July, But Unsure What‚Äôs Next**   >   >Powell‚Äôs testimony will be scrutnized for clues on rates   >   >Treasury 2-year yields have risen about 20bps from June low   >   >By Liz Capo McCormick   >   >(Bloomberg) --   >   >Lurking beyond traders‚Äô apparently unwavering confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month is a more nebulous outlook about what the central bank will do after that.   >   >Traders are still pricing a full quarter-point reduction in July, yet they have slowly scaled back views on how much easing will take place for all of 2019 -- **lowering expectations to 64 basis points from around 80 basis points two weeks ago**. At the same time, options traders are still adding to bets the Fed will embark on a series of cuts, rather than a one-and-done approach.   >   >‚ÄúThe market collectively thinks there‚Äôs a cut coming this month because the Fed has basically said there will be,‚Äù said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. ‚ÄúBut to think there‚Äôs a big string of cuts coming after that you have to believe in a serious economic downturn and that‚Äôs not clear -- especially after the June labor data.‚Äù   >   >The addition of a higher-than-expected 224,000 jobs in June seems to make it less urgent for the Fed to take aggressive action. That means it‚Äôs even more crucial for traders to scrutinize guidance on the policy path this week as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell starts his two-day testimony to Congress Wednesday, the same day the central bank will publish the minutes of its June meeting.   >   >If Powell ‚Äúmakes clear that all is not well, and that he stands ready to do more, then markets might soar but real business confidence might tank,‚Äù Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note.   >   >Dealings in eurodollar options after the July 5 payroll data show traders have put aside views the Fed may cut rates by half a percentage point this month (a quarter-point is now seen as a lock). Yet even as the amount of easing priced in has been dialed back, those options traders have also favored buying contracts that profit if Fed officials reduce rates beyond just their July 30-31 policy meeting.   >   >Hawkish Signs   >   >‚ÄúHawkish would be anything that puts into question a second cut,‚Äù Steven Englander, global head of foreign-exchange research at Standard Chartered Bank in New York, wrote in a report. ‚ÄúHints at ‚Äòone and-done‚Äô could be devastating to market pricing, even if Powell pointed to a July cut.‚Äù   >   >U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter, and is tracking about a 1.3% annual rate, according to the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs tracker. Proponents of a rate cut have pointed to weak inflation and uncertainty over trade tensions as further reasons for the Fed to ease policy.   >   >Powell might strike a cautiously optimistic tone, which will possibly be a slight disappointment for doves, John Herrmann at MUFG Securities in New York, wrote in a note Tuesday. ‚ÄúBut the economy‚Äôs more gripping risks suggest further interest-rate cuts are in the offing.‚Äù   >   >Treasury two-year yields were little changed at 1.91% early in London trading on Wednesday, having risen from June‚Äôs low of 1.69%.|2019-07-10 07:12:44
