ivx8g4|qkanjp|qkanjp|4|DID THE 24/7 SUPPLY CHAIN FIX SHT? The port of LA/Long Beach is to start the countdown with its new $100 a day per container rule, which applies for rail shipments three days from now and trucks in nine days. These fees rise daily: e.g., a 10,000 TEU ship faces a 10,000 * $100 = $1m fee on day 1 its cargo is still stuck in the port (i.e., NOT in the ship!); 10,000 * $200 = $2m on day 2; 10,000 * $300 = $3m on day 3, etc. If they get delayed 3 weeks, the total bill will be $231m, which works out as $23,100 per TEU. That more than doubles the already-high cost of ocean carrying.  ( WTF? Labor shortages and one crane per 50-100 trucks etc? Fixed?) B screwed.|2021-11-01 09:20:57

Celsius is growing much faster and should be valued at a significant premium to BodyArmour. Therefore, if BodyArmour is worth ~$6.59 billion, one can reasonably estimate that Celsius may be worth ~$10 - $15 billion. At $10 billion, that would put Celsius at $135/share on the low end and $200/share on the high end.|2021-11-01 12:08:29

ix7n26|qkanjp|qkanjp|3|Pro tip when yoloing into a stock:  Don't think twice about yoloing into a good company that is at or near ATH.  No bagholders = no one looking to offload bags at the nearest uptick.  This is why whenever people try to catch a falling knife, it usually doesn't work out.  Many bagholders = price suppression on any uptick as bagholders look to move on.  PLTR and CRSR are 2 examples of stocks that got stuck in this shitty loop.  Neither can maintain a sustained uptick because bagholders are unloading at high volume any time stock moves up to their break-even point  tl;dr Buy AMD now!!!  That's an order!!!  P.S.

iws5no|qkanjp|qkanjp|8|TSLA and GME behave similarly. My theory is that in both cases, supply for shares is locked up in retail investors who refuse to sell. As a result, whenever there is incremental demand, this shit shoots up.   No matter what, no one sells their TSLA shares. Any sort of short covering or anything thus fucks the price up.   Eventually maybe years down the line, they‚Äôll miss earnings or growth forecasts and this shit will come cratering down as retail investors baghold and eventually sell.    But for now, this shit is the new US T bill.|2021-11-01 13:03:19

Do I need enough collateral (cash) to be able to exercise the leap I bought at a strike price of $20 to buy the stock to cover the calls I sold or do I sell the leap at the price of the leap itself and that somehow covers it (I don't see how though since I need to cover the shares not just the calls)  Thanks for helping out a true retard.

ivis1i|qkanjp|qkanjp|-14|$6 billion is more than enough to solve global hunger and prevent the upcoming famines.  Spend a billion each in North America, South America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Africa.  Put a third of the spending into immediate expansion of local agriculture, where $300 million per continent can likely make the difference for about 3 million lives to have enough food on each continent.  Put half the spending into factories that produce a self-replicating set of vertically integrated construction robots that can handle everything from collecting material for construction of vertical farms to handling basic elements of harvesting the output so that all people have to do is direct the machines and process what they eat by hand (so that machines don't have to waste time with stuff like husking corn). The only limit to how many lives this can save is how intelligent the design can get with using the money efficiently, and how far distribution can reach.   Which brings us to the most important part of the spending and the reason 6 billion is more than enough. Put the remaining spending into military equipment and wages for a private security force to protect the people distributing the food.  **While agricultural surplus is in an emergency level decline and this will not be true anymore soon,** we currently grow more than enough food to feed everyone on Earth and there are actually significant resources going towards getting more than enough food to those that don't have enough. The problem is the people in charge of the world do not want everyone to live so the organizations trying to feed people aren't allowed to do what it takes to succeed and are instead misdirected to waste their resources.  Most of the people starving to death are in warzones where the Red Cross has more than enough money that they could just march right in and pass out White Castle Crave Cases like candy if they were allowed to use a Predator drone to shoot whoever tries to stop them. A Predator drone doesn't cost anywhere near 6 billion dollars. A single billion will get you a lot more than a single Predator drone. While you're building an army of self-replicating robots, maybe you can even be more efficient with your spending. But you don't need to be. 6 billion is more than enough.   The problem isn't that nobody can get 6 billion dollars together to spend on food worldwide. The problem is billionaires are way more psychopathically evil than just not wanting to pay 6 billion dollars to feed the poor. They have people starving to death because that is part of how they've set the world up to operate.|2021-11-01 07:10:39
