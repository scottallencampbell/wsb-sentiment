c6gmvd|pkus1y|pkus1y|13|Am I the only one who feels like their stocks are in a permanent down trend? Even when they have green days its almost always followed by a lower low the following week.  I've actually forgotten what a bull run feels like which is pretty fucking alarming considering the S&P and Nasdaq are in one of the biggest bull runs in history.  I ask myself everyday why I bought the stocks I did instead of buying the mega caps or just the index and honestly it always comes down to greed... I wanted more than the average and instead I got significantly less than the average, negative in most cases in fact.|2021-09-09 08:30:44

c7vekm|pkus1y|pkus1y|-1|I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me. Dang|2021-09-09 14:29:37

c83kc5|pkus1y|pkus1y|0|Has anyone looked into the story with CBL properties? Basically their bank wrote letters to CBL tenants asking them to pay rent to the bank.

I'm a noob idiot that likes to get a little chuck and tickle from losing money.|2021-09-09 15:24:49
