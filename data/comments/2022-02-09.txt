toq2co|mlyq20|mlyq20|16|Retard here. Please respond.  How is it that PLTR volume is always so damn high, and yet price movement is so damn flat? I‚Äôm strongly ‚Äúguessing‚Äù it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an equal amount of buyers and sellers. Is it still the sell off of shares by long time holders, like company execs? The sentiment from retail investors is to buy and hold. So if it‚Äôs not retail doing the selling, and the sell offs aren‚Äôt predominantly still due to company execs and long time shareholder holders....and institutions haven‚Äôt bought in to a massive extent (to sell)...is the flat price movement due to options trading?   And, Everytime I check, the volume of calls being bought far exceeds puts being bought...wouldn‚Äôt that make the price rise?   What am I missing. Be as much of an asshole as you want but can someone please lmk for real what the deal is? They had two massive new contracts recently.

There was a case to be made that this would keep companies honest and incentive people to dig for wrong doing. But that is far from the main results of short selling now.  And now anyone has the ability to share information instantly and it can be accessed by pretty much anyone on the planet. One of the pillars of perfect competition, which is what every market is supposed aspire to or head towards, is perfect information. We are closer to that than we have ever been (miles to go though).  \*Takes a deep breath\* In conclusion, it's time for short selling in its current form to bite the dust.|2021-04-07 14:02:07

Test the waters - average cost down into a position (not always, but do this if not sure about a play). 3. Only play weeklies and 0dte if you know what's up. Otherwise stick to AT LEAST 1 month out expiry, or 2 month - for added safety (though reduced leverage, thus reduced potential gain and loss). 4. Buy ITM or ATM only. OTM options is why you always lose, even if you picked the direction right. 5. This is all just a game. If you're here to solve your financial problems - stop and talk to a professional financial advisor. This is 100% gambling. It's possible to get rich off this, but neither fast, nor guaranteed, nor easy. Slow and steady wins the race, so get a job to figure out your finances, and only gamble here with what you can afford to lose (duh!).|2021-04-07 13:03:56

toa4qf|mlyq20|mlyq20|8|Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.  It‚Äôs a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.  Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That‚Äôs the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it‚Äôs a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.  We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. ‚ÄúSupposed to‚Äù because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up.   Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He‚Äôs not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.  All else being equal there are reasons to believe the excess liquidity sloshing around the system will find its way to risk assets, specifically stocks, before too long. First quarter earnings could change that, but that will be the story for next week.|2021-04-07 05:54:09

tob6no|mlyq20|mlyq20|2|Quick Rant:   Trading FX and commodities can be more profitable than options. (I trade options too).   Reason: Cross correlations and Commodity currencies.   Cross currency correlation:  If you know that GBP/USD is going up you can open long positions in GBP/CAD and GBP/JPY tripling your profits simultaneously.   Commodity Currencies: If commodities like gold in Australia are going up, you can simultaneously hold long positions on Gold as well as AUS/USD since countries who‚Äôs currencies are connected to strong commodities have a positive correlation.   It‚Äôs like killing 5 birds with one stone. Multiple profits with one play. (if you do it right)  It‚Äôs also the only market that‚Äôs open 24hrs a day, 5 days a week (asides from weekends) so you can trade pretty much anytime you want.   Then you can re-invest most of your gains from trading currencies and commodities back into trading options or long term equity plays.  This is the way.  Sry just a rant, been a member before GME and bandwagon fans, and I also like trading options but it‚Äôd be nice to see FX and commodities trading get some more love on here too. :)   Also, for BB shares, EoY target price $40 and $150+ in 3-5 years. good long term value investment with QNX + IVY + rise of EV market.|2021-04-07 06:08:03

Which options would you recommend for May that would yield the max profit assuming the stock goes to 420.

Plus tons of people put off buying new cars during the pandemic and will be buying now so I think it's going to be a good year. On top of all that they just invested over a billion in EV development so I'm hoping to see a new ATH by 2025.

You found this out naturally as an end user using its software. You intend to make this knowledge public on WSB, as well as on other mediums.  Key points: 1. You discovered this flaw as an end user of their software (they have millions of end users) 2. It is not public knowledge yet 3. You are not employed by the company nor do you have friends/family at the company  The question: is it illegal to load up on puts prior to revealing the information?

It does not matter what the broad market or other meme stocks or other highly valued software stocks are doing. PLTR always dumps at opening.  I bet my left nut that PLTR will reach at least 50 in the future, but unfortunately I am not a hedgie with 1 bil. dollars who could invest in thousands of securities.
