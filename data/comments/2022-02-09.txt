w8ly41|soax1f|soax1f|6|The best cure for stock market euphoria is a sobering lesson in stock market history. During 1999-2000 the Fed gradually raised interest rates by 2%. The S&P 500 hovered near its peak in the 1,350-1,520 range during the first 8 months of 2000 then steadily declined by 47% to 815 during the next 2 years. It didn't make it back up to 1,520 until 2007 which was the peak just before the next recession in 2007. It once again declined by 52% during the next 2 years. It wasn‚Äôt until 2013 that it made it back up to 1,520 which was the breakeven point for those who had bought at the peak in 2000. Valuation metrics and giddy retail sentiment are positioning the markets for a repeat, but this time around the Fed will be less willing and mostly unable to prevent any substantial declines.  Take your minor wins while you can still get them permabulls.  We will still fuck you in the ass in the long run over the next two years. Mark my words.|2022-02-09 10:03:58

w95607|soax1f|soax1f|6|God damn, one of the biggest blunders of Pelosi's career has to have been when she completely dismissed the idea of restricting stock trading by Congress in that one press conference. All she had to do was answer with some humility and say something generic like how terrible it was that some congress members profited off the pandemic by dumping stock right before the lockdown and that they need to make sure congress members aren't using their position for profit. That probably would have been the end to it. Instead she scoffed at the notion retorting "it's a free market" which made headlines everywhere cuz it was so out of touch. It put a target on her back, and gave tons of momentum to the idea of banning all stock holdings. If that makes it to the floor it's basically would be way too popular to vote against it.

I‚Äôm to lazy to do real DD, but the way CPI incorporates housing there is a lag. They have units that they track, but they only survey them once every 6 months. So it basically takes a full 6 months to really see the extent of housings effect on inflation.  Housing is also like 30-40% of the index. Don‚Äôt know about you guys, but I‚Äôm hearing a lot of chatter about ‚Äúthe rent is too damn high‚Äù.

w91jiu|soax1f|soax1f|2|Can someone explain to my dumb brain how investing in an ETF works?   SPY for instance. When I buy a share of SPY, am I influencing the price of it at all? As far as I understand, SPY tracks the S&P, and the S&P is an aggregated price of the 500 largest US companies. Do I buy a share of SPY and then the fund managers take that money and invest it in those 500 companies respective to each company's weight which then influences the price of SPY/SPX? Or are the SPX and SPY completely separated from the 500 companies they hold, have no influence on the prices of the underlying, and are more akin to a third-party spot price simply telling you this aggregated value?  Basically, I'm asking if SPY is the chicken or the egg: does buying/selling SPY move the price of Apple and friends, or does buying/selling Apple and friends move the price of SPY? Or is SPY possibly the chicken *and* the egg in that they both move each other both ways?|2022-02-09 11:40:06

w7r0jq|soax1f|soax1f|5|this is part 2 of CMG article on TDAmeritrade. wtf?  I was disabled for about 10 years. During that time a woman befriended me, and asked to move in. I needed no assistance, but she was homeless and I was alone. We agreed she would pay half the rent and utilities, which she did for a year.    She would "cash advance" my credit cards and ATM and tell me she had placed these funds in her bank for me. She collected other sums of cash, and did the same. I also paid the entire food bill for two. All the while I was on heavy medications.    I knew I was being taken advantage of but she said if I stopped paying her half the bills, I would get nothing. So it went on that way for 10 years. She kept track of the amounts and tell me the balances, but I was never allowed to withdraw any.    She had been mentally abusing me to the point I went to a hospital for rest. I was no longer impaired and thinking clearly. I had given her  $40,000  or more. I asked firmly for  $10,000  so I could buy a car. She laughed and said, "You really didn't think you would get that back."    I was abused and conned in my home for a long time, and there are no witnesses. All I have are tape recordings where she sneers and says she lied about this to me. And repeated, "No one will believe me." Will they be of any value to a lawyer?    \-- Feeling Hopeless|2022-02-09 06:06:11

w9xkxz|soax1f|soax1f|2|Sit down kids, pull up an sandbag, history lesson time.  On this day in 1966, the Vietnam-era U.S. bull market came to an end.  Where Was The Market? The S&P 500 was at 94.06 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 995.15.  Death Of The 1960s Bull: The U.S. economy was booming in the 1960s. An increasing number of Americans bought stocks throughout the decade, sending the Dow near 1,000 for the first time in January 1966. In fact, the huge market boom of the 1960s was not unlike the boom of the 1920s. Between February 1956 and February 1966, the Dow more than doubled, gaining 111%.  Interest rates played a key role in the longevity of the rise  Once the bull disappeared in 1966, however, it didn‚Äôt make its return for quite a long time. The Dow didn‚Äôt break 1,000 again until November 1980, more than 14 years later. It took more than 20 years for the Dow to double once more and close above the 2,000 level for the first time in January 1987.|2022-02-09 14:57:24

(ya I know, big spender lol)  &#x200B;  Massive overselling creating a great entry point for a stock that, while I'm not always crazy about, is still a massive moneymaker and has growing income streams from a series of successful acquisitions.    I think the 'metaverse' won't pan out as well as they're hoping, but FB is about 70% of the entire VR industry and its a quickly growing industry. Probably not one with limitless potential but I can easily see 100 mill unit sales for occulus & then all the store purchases that go with it in a 5 year window.   Nobody ever lost money selling escapism to technophiles.   &#x200B;  I may never own a real lambo, but I'll be driving my e-gf in a lambo to my yacht in the metaverse.|2022-02-09 08:55:59

w9ee0k|soax1f|soax1f|2|I don't know why I am typing this.  There is a difference BTFD in a stock under all the 50, 100, and 200 DMA's on the 3 month chart like $CLF that still had support above the 100 and 200 DMA's on the 2 yr chart than BTFD on stocks like $SQ, $PYPL, $ARKK, and even $FB to a lessor extent that are all below the 50, 100, 200 DMA's on both the 3 month and 2 year charts. Trying to catch a falling knife refers to BTFD on stocks with no support.  Now of all the stocks mentioned $FB might be a buy if it holds above $233 (200 DMA on 2 yr) after CPI Thursday's close.  But just looking at % down from ATH's is a losing strategy that has been proven since dot com thru 2008 thru 2018.|2022-02-09 12:58:30

The more bagholders the more people will want to unload except the buyers wont be there because everyone knows you guys are all down 75% at best by now. Since this is the case, you're all gonna end up in a race to the bottom to unload your worthless positions before you hit 0. Buyers know this and wont give you the ask you request and the bid/ask will tighten up at low prices further skewing volatility to the downside.   &#x200B;  Good luck.|2022-02-09 11:22:04
