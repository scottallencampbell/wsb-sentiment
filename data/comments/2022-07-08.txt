Do the same time 2 weeks later for the GDP release. Market will selloff for 5-7 days after CPI, then bounce for a few days and then crater on a negative GDP that puts us in a recession.

TSLA missed deliveries, is shutting down factories for upgrades even as they move delivery dates further out and face increased competition  MSTR is still underwater as a company, has negative earnings, better options for gambling on BTC, huge liabilities and is trading at a higher price than when it’s assets were nearly $1B higher.  DDOG is valued at 35B with the revenue of a 5B startup and has pumped 25% in a week based on 0 positive news  The macroeconomic situation is bad and worsening (with the caveat of some drop in gas prices)  I don’t mind losing money when I get a prediction wrong, but when I get it right and lose that really hurts.

What are the incentives of lenders to sell mortgages to wall street?  Answer, volume at the expense of credit standards.  When interest rates bottom how far can lenders push mortgage terms to keep refinances, loan volume, and home prices rising?  What percentage of jobs are dependent on rising home prices?

fd99cu|vu75oc|vu75oc|3|Anyone ever try condors on spy based off of charting?  I know it seems stupid on such volatility but I feel like spy charting is easier to predict than single stocks.  Condors are hard to sell but spy volume could prove helpful for this.  Am also a retard so if anyone actually makes money using this strategy please advise.  Thanks.|2022-07-08 12:17:21

ffj335|vu75oc|vu75oc|-2|All right faggots, i’m gonna show you my full proof way of getting free margin. I’ve been doing this for about five years and have never actually paid for margin. So what you Gotta do is set up share lending through your broker, Buy stocks on margin, ensure that your Margin is split up, so if you have for example, three stocks, and 25k cash. you divvy the 25k And 25k of margin equally through position size. So if you buy 20k aapl, 10k cash 10k margin. With margin interest rates forwarding around 2% you get a round 2% back per year lending your shares this basically canceled out your margin payment, and I usually get a little extra maybe like five bucks or so.

How will the federal reserve keep wage inflation from spiraling out of control? These companies will have to offer more and more to try and poach from their competitors to fill their job vacancies. I guess with all these tech companies freezing hiring and starting layoffs that’ll force more people into service/trades. But I doubt it’s enough to fill the gap. Fed will be forced to pivot.

fdbrz2|vu75oc|vu75oc|0|Idk fellow apes maybe this soft landing is possible.  Rates can continue to go up if labor market holds up. Most of the fun money is from stimulus, market gains, and housing gains. You take those 3 out and the fed could Def slow down to a nice stopping point and keep rates level until they need to pull the trigger on an emergency cut if they need.
