-iPhone demand softer than expected
-Global PC sales (and hence Mac) down
-Forex issues cutting into margins
-Component prices cutting into margins
-Kept iPhone pricing the same when rumors suggested increases to protect margins
-Q4 guidance called for 1.6% increase in EPS, 6.1% YoY increase in revenue; if iPhone and Mac demand has been that soft, where are those increases coming from?
-Tim Apple is OG 🌈🐻

Bullish case for Apple:

-Services business is strong, and that is consistent money coming in
-Large supply of cash on hand; higher interest rates equal more interest revenue
-App Store revenue is also consistent $$$ coming in

I put half my account on 192.50c 11/25... But I'm a poor and it's under 1k I'm just experimenting and learning... I figure when I can take 500 bucks to 20k or so, I'll be convinced I'm worthy and dump in real savings... And I've been ping-pong back and forth from about 800 to about 1500 over and over lol. Ah well, gotta get the knack before betting the farm, so to spek. 

I've had bouts with the stonk market before, and always eventually get fucked and get scary and pull out. Especially if it's become real money. Best sesh for me was 500->16k->5k and then I really needed the 5k...

I'm kinda getting the impression that it's more better strategy to wait mostly all the time, while still watching closely, and leverage hard into certain plays that meet *all* the criteria. From chart signals, to company macros, to put/call ratio in the direction of the play, etc. etc. If you start poking around for every good play out there, you make loads of mistakes. If you focus on like a few nice blue chips & get super familiar with their price action, this seems like the way to go.

In its press release, the company also warned it anticipates Reality Labs’ operating losses to “grow significantly” in 2023.

Despite the steep losses, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg doubled down on the company’s metaverse push during the earnings call, saying “people are going to look back on decades from now and talk about the importance of the work that was done here.”

Both complicated bets but going to watch. Really don't like being 100% "invested". Felt much better with 50% cash.

 I am funding my trip off this account. Took my last draw on it (I hope). Did a quick check and am averaging 10k a month with withdrawls. Trip all paid for and still have significantly more in my port than when we started. As market drops that will only get better.

There once was a shepherd boy who was bored as he sat on the hillside watching the village sheep. To amuse himself he took a great breath and sang out, "SELL! ! The bear is chasing the sheep!"

The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the bear away. But when they arrived at the top of the hill, they found no bear. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces.

"Don't cry 'SELL', shepherd boy," said the villagers, "when there's no bear!" They went grumbling back down the hill.

Later, the boy sang out again, "SELL! SELL! The bear is chasing the sheep!" To his naughty delight, he watched the villagers run up the hill to help him drive the bear away.

When the villagers saw no bear they sternly said, "Save your frightened song for when there is really something wrong! Don't cry 'SELL' when there is NO bear!"

But the boy just grinned and watched them go grumbling down the hill once more.

Later, he saw a REAL bear prowling about his flock. Alarmed, he leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could, "SELL! SELL!"

But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again, and so they didn't come.

At sunset, everyone wondered why the shepherd boy hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy. They found him weeping.

"There really was a bear here! The flock has scattered! I cried out, "SELL!" Why didn't you come?"

An old man tried to comfort the boy as they walked back to the village.

"We'll help you look for the lost sheep in the morning," he said, putting his arm around the youth, "Nobody believes a liar...even when he is telling the truth!"|2022-10-27 08:54:25tzogg2|yenwt6|yenwt6|-2|Bull trap load up on puts bb|2022-10-27 09:10:42tzt6po|yenwt6|yenwt6|-2|AAPL drops 2% today, rallies 2% AH, then ends tommorow down 1%.
