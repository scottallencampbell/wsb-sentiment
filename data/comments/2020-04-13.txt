nao000|g0gvfn|g0gvfn|11|China reports largest number of cases in six weeks:  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/13/coronavirus-latest-news/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/13/coronavirus-latest-news/)   I know "long term spy puts to bet against the reopening" is the most hivemind opinion here, but jeez, this feels like deja vu all over again. Watching things just beginning to fall apart in Asia while the market stubbornly believes things will be just fine in the US feels a \*LOT\* like early February.  Of course, IV is much much higher so this time it's both a riskier and lower upside play...but still...who knew that just paying attention to what's happening in non-western countries could feel like an information advantage...|2020-04-13 12:59:52

namt8s|g0gvfn|g0gvfn|8|There is a Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) where the **Fed is illegally accepting stocks as collateral for loans** to the trading houses on Wall Street – as it also did during the 2008 financial crash. Under any possible interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act under which the Fed operates, it is only allowed to accept “good” collateral for loans. When the stock market is making wild swings and losing as much as 3,000 points in a day, stocks are decidedly not “good” collateral. Loans issued to the trading houses of Wall Street under the PDCF facility grew from $27.7 billion on March 25 to $33 billion on April 1, an increase of 19 percent in one week. During the 2007 to 2010 financial crisis, the Fed made $8.95 trillion in revolving loans from its then newly created PDCF facility. It kept that $8.95 trillion a secret from the public until Congressional legislation forced it out into the sunshine.  This motherfucker game is rigged.|2020-04-13 12:50:08

nasmb8|g0gvfn|g0gvfn|12|Some anecdotal DD: my parents are small time commercial real estate landlords.  Their tenants include: National Auto Body chain, large dealer of tractors and other industrial equipment, and other similar types of businesses for the few properties they own.  They’ve received letters from their tenants essentially saying “we will now only be paying you half of our due rent indefinitely”.  Basically, F you, were not paying our rent any more for as long as the eye can see and there’s nothing you can do about it.  That’s not just one outlier, it’s every single tenant they have.  Ppl don’t realize how bad this is going to get, these stories are all too common.

nallsi|g0gvfn|g0gvfn|18|FED's balance sheet blasts to $5.8T, FED is backing to **bail out foreign banks** along with Wall Street.  FED [released the shocking details](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/) of what it has been up to in the past weeks. Its balance sheet has skyrocketed from $5.3 trillion as of March 25 to $5.85 trillion, a growth of $557 billion in one week’s time.  One of the factors affecting this growth was a $142 billion jump in the amount of its Central Bank Liquidity Swaps, where it provides dollars to foreign central banks in exchange for their local currency. During the last financial crisis, some of these dollar swaps were used to bail out global foreign banks that were in trouble. Given the current condition of numerous European banks, and their ties through derivatives to Wall Street’s mega banks, there is every reason to believe these dollar swaps are another thinly disguised bailout of a Frankenbank-financial system – for the second time in 12 years.|2020-04-13 12:40:16

Throw said money into long term bank puts(December expiry). I think you know what's next. We aint paying any of that interest shit. Until the day of reversal, Christmas eve. We all sell our puts for big tendies, pay back our loans to hopefully save credit scores and then buy all the calls our pussy asses can afford.  If every member took out a $25,000 loan that's 25 BILLION in loans not being paid! Ok i just realized how insignificant this is. Jesus i am but a puny ant in a field of giants|2020-04-13 11:31:33

But we need to get this forum back on track on tracking down meme stocks and good DD. The front page is literally nothing but bear posts and the mega thread can become saturated with them.  Back in the day things like TSLA’s run today would be hyped up and everyone would get on board. I remember SPCE had a front page post right before it went parabolic. Even the crash had a front page post and hype. After the crash though this place changed and everyone is stuck on that meme instead of moving on like this place used to do  /end rant|2020-04-13 16:20:35

Many of you though probably read the articles claiming “worst in NY is over” “were plateauing” whatever.   Not true. My mom has chest pains and trouble breathing and is still being denied care - you literally need to be on the cusp of grasping for air and only then will you get care. My moms not on her death bed or anything.. but those are the signs, any other symptom of a disease you’d be tested for it.. unless of course you didn’t have a lot of test kits.   Point being no there’s not a lot of tests still, clearly. Imagine how many others were told the same thing.   Don’t give in to politics.. there literally has not been a glimpse of a turnaround other than the fact that the virus doesn’t seem as deadly as portrayed.

nax53g|g0gvfn|g0gvfn|4|This is interesting to me, since I just came across what the NFP is. It is released once a month on the first Friday of the month (April 3rd this month) covering the previous month.  The NFP (Nonfarm Payrolls) measures the change in the number of people employed during the previous month, excluding the farming industry. Job creation is the foremost indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity.  The latest report for the month has the NFP at (-)701K. It was estimated to be (-)100k. The previous month and all other months prior were around (+)250k.

Break above channel invalidates above. Breaking VWAP downwards confirms downside https://i.imgur.com/QYdINNd.jpg  https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0gvfn/_/fna4c1j/?context=1 go downvote this some more thanks.   Edit: VWAP broken. Testing lower wedge, then lower channel. As I’m typing this lower wedge broke and now testing lower channel/2735. https://i.imgur.com/FXsrIye.jpg  Edit 2: lower channel (light purple) broken. Downside confirmed. https://i.imgur.com/OeThjyZ.jpg  Edit 3: https://i.imgur.com/BABJwWi.jpg small attempt to get back in channel. Not going to happen.  Edit 4: https://i.imgur.com/jO1h1fb.jpg rejected  Edit 6: just in case anyone else is still reading this, 2710 is key (March 13th gap), 2640 is major (double top). Free fall down to 2550-2430 if we break below those two levels.  Edit 7: Holding 2750 today into the close would open for a move down to 2710 very easily. After that, edit 6 applies.   Couldn’t see anything the last 30ish mins because TOS was down so couldn’t really see where we were headed to call it out. Oh well. As of now we are testing VWAP (2740), resistance level (2740), low volume, touching 60 RSI on 5m, 50 RSI on 15m. Downside likely. Should see big rejection. Break through 2745 invalidates above. Break below 2730-2735 will open up 2722 to confirm. https://i.imgur.com/e4qVtyi.jpg  Edit 8: once again just like edit 3, trying to test back in channel, rejection very likely. https://i.imgur.com/FLu9PQ1.jpg   levels to watch for potential bounce: 2730 (resistance level we’ve been testing all day and last night), 2722-2725 (lower bound of 15m channel). https://i.imgur.com/ZjLHQ8B.jpg  Edit 9: https://i.imgur.com/MDXjjM6.jpg rejected  Edit 10: found support at 2726 and were now stuck in a bit of a range. Technicals say we will be heading down. 15m RSI back above 50, 5m RSI back above 50, rejected VWAP earlier, low volume/demand, upper channel now below 2745). However during power (half) hour fundamentals are more in play, could be seeing a short squeeze. This channel (white lines) on the 15m https://i.imgur.com/WPbKP1W.jpg is getting narrower by the minute (top at ~2744, low at ~2726). Downside likely according to techs. Personal hunch is short squeeze EOD. I trade more on techs than personal hunches.  Edit 11: New trendline forming (light blue from top of previous channel) https://i.imgur.com/RBC0e9L.jpg bearish. Wedge from bottom of previous channel https://i.imgur.com/KFnNfJe.jpg  Edit 12: Super low volume. As mentioned in edit 10 we’re in a bit of a range. Power hour when volume picks up will determine our fate. Techs pointing downside. As I’m typing we had another rejection from top of wedge (2 light blue drawn from previous channel).  Edit 13: Broke through upper wedge (top light blue). Testing VWAP at 2740 (dark blue), if broken then upper wedge of 2743 (top white). Techs still say we’re going down but like I said before, fundamentals come into play during power (half) hour. https://i.imgur.com/IKYmIfk.jpg  Winding up for a big move.  Edit 14: If we take a look at 15m chart for the day, big wedge (yellow). https://i.imgur.com/0nQDAVV.jpg bearish as we have multiple resistance levels along with VWAP + smaller wedge on 5m in previous edit pointing bearish. I see a large pullback here but we have to break this wedge one way or another to see where we’re headed. Upper is currently ~2738 lower is ~2728.  Edit 15: big test here https://i.imgur.com/YxT7I6s.jpg cross followed by white lower channel end.  Edit 16: Has anyone seen volume? Where has he gone? https://i.imgur.com/7ax4BRU.jpg range has tightened to ~2736 (upper) and ~2730 (lower) looking for break in either direction. https://i.imgur.com/xCQOhKA.jpg looking for break above VWAP for confirmation (2745) and below lower end of channel for confirmation (2725).  In summary, above 2736 signals up, 2745 confirms it. 2730 signals down 2725 confirms it.  Edit 17: rejected confirmation and now looking to get back in channel, similar to edit 3 and 8, then it’ll have to go through VWAP just to get back to where it was 10 mins ago.https://i.imgur.com/DQCJZfi.jpg  In the event we don’t, some resistance levels are 2745, 2750, 2755, and 2763.   Edit 18: Back in channel but testing VWAP. If we break below 2740, we are headed to 2733 minimum (unlikely).  Edit 19: If we reject 2750 here then we go back down to 2742. However it looks like we will be testing 2755 shortly as VWAP is starting to trend up. Bullish.  Edit 20: ranging 2755-2750. If we break below 2750 then we go 2742 minimum (likely now that RSI is approaching over bought levels). If we break above then we will test 2763 minimum (unlikely).  Edit 21: There’s the break. Gap filled to 2763. More testing now. Rejection likely as were touching 70 RSI on the 5m. As I mentioned before though, technicals are less telling as fundamentals are more in play EOD.  Edit 22: Rejected after touching 70 RSI and straight plummeted through 2750 with no regard. ~2740 as it is upper bound for previous channel (white) and VWAP (dark blue) https://i.imgur.com/b3n2khT.jpg minor support at 2745 (Wednesday’s close).  Edit 23: Battle for 2750 is real.   Edit 24: This started as a basic call out for what I thought would happened based on TA and turned into something else entirely lol. Closed above 2750, could be seeing more green this week if we don’t gap down tomorrow because of earnings. Despite tomorrow being more telling and today being a down day, this is technically bullish. Might see a retest of 50% fib retracement level (2785) medium term but tomorrow, like I said, will be more telling of where we’re headed.  tl;dr: Thursday was February 19th. Today is February 20th if we close below 2750 on /ES.|2020-04-13 11:21:11

The way I see it unfolding after working with him for 15 years, is the stock will sell off on earnings from $250 to $212 and he will say “I got it right.”  That’s a whole other ball of wax and psychiatrist meetings, but inversing his highest conviction trades is a definite winning strategy over nearly 20 years.|2020-04-13 15:12:57

"Can't have that beer virus spread all over my Xbox, PC, or near my girlfriend", he said, totally valid point. But unlike all you autists, my wife's boyfriend is a cool guy. He has temporarily lifted his ban on fapping so I won't be so bored. But there are problems: I can't fap without visual aid and I can't use tissue because of the toilet paper shortage. Luckily, he's not only cool, but bigly smart. He rented out to me 3 amateur videos of him and my wife together for only $420 AND he has allowed me to use his old fap sock.

If we can see 279 as resistance (this is where we closed Friday), we move lower this week. I told you about 279 on Wed and Thursday.  I made all these numbers up and did zero technical analysis of any kind using Fib or Elliot Wave Theory. It's just voodoo, so don't make fucking comments about where I got the numbers. Just pay attention to them and see if my witchcraft works.  I will buy calls above 279 until 293, puts below 279.|2020-04-13 06:51:58

Which means that the people who own the pork belly contracts are saying, "Hey, we're losing all our damn money, and Christmas is around the corner, and I ain't gonna have no money to buy my son the G.I. Joe with the kung-fu grip! And my wife ain't gonna gonna make love to me if I got no money!" So they're panicking right now, they're screaming "SELL! SELL!" to get out before the price keeps dropping. They're panicking out there right now, I can feel it.  &#x200B;  PUTS ON HORMEL (HRL)|2020-04-13 07:44:07

n9unwr|g0gvfn|g0gvfn|2|>Dunkin’ Brands (DNKN) – Credit Suisse gave the restaurant chain’s stock a double-upgrade to “outperform” from “underperform,” noting both valuation and the company’s 100% franchised business model. The firm said that model is one of the most attractive in the restaurant industry and warrants a premium to its peers.  This could become a pump and dump. The franchise model enables them to avoid short-term damage but if franchisees start going out of business then they'll see a noticeable reduction in Q3 and beyond.|2020-04-13 08:36:12

nbg3ok|g0gvfn|g0gvfn|2|So this won't happen, but I am being serious when I say if every single member of wsb (like all 1 million members) each bought like 2 upside TSLA calls tomorrow, that will push TSLA probably up like 10% because market makers have to then hedge by buying stock as well as pushing up upside vol (which then makes them even shorter delta), which then creates a circular loop that also forces shorts to cover.  Then market makers have to keep buying stock as they get into the short upside gamma region, so TSLA will go up 10%+.  That's what I mean when I say TSLA doesn't trade on fundamentals, just a gamma switchboard that lights up.|2020-04-13 16:55:21

The virus itself is a-lot less deadly than expected.   Some companies are still doing well in this environment.   You’re able to pick the winners and losers.

Estimate .5-.75% rally without news.   Small gap down during after hours without news. Volume continues to drop as the market gets nervous about leg 2 of the corona virus (jobs market).|2020-04-13 12:32:31
