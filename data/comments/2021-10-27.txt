It’s a very mean and nasty TICKER and I don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as SPY. But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now if you know what you’re CALLS are worth then HOLD until you get what they're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the DIPS, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t as RICH as you want to be because of him, or her, or anybody! BEARS do that and that ain’t you! You’re better than that! I’m always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You’re my RETARD and you’re my blood. You’re the best thing in my life. But until you start believing in SPY, ya ain’t gonna have a life. “|2021-10-27 13:46:36

i8mkpv|qgt5w7|qgt5w7|7|Just saw a comment about the hertz-uber-tsla-cvna deal being stupid and I want to bring a contrary discussion to the thread. I feel like this is a good move for all of the parties EXCEPT for the uber drivers themselves, but there are even cases where this will be GOOD for them. This deal for hertz will only be in 4 major cities where cars are an issue. This allows people without cars to now be able to pick up some side gigs with uber. Their profits will be diminished due to the costs of renting the vehicle but hopefully due to the decrease in gas expenses and increased premium of uber riders riding in a luxury car it might make up for not owning the vehicle. This looks like a huge win for all.....|2021-10-27 07:29:58

It's not likely to move much at first, but will likely move $50-100 in the same direction that it moves after earnings are announced.  Look at the momentum we're seeing out of MSFT/GOOG.  AMZN is likely to follow that pattern with a ton of money rotating in or out.  You'd have been much better off buying GOOG calls at open today than yesterday.  You do not need to buy high vol options beforehand that require it to open up or down $75-100 to break even.|2021-10-27 10:24:33

I think there's a decent chance we see a big AMZN breakout at some point given what we're seeing out of MSFT and GOOG.  Obviously AMZN has the cloud operation and also the ad revenue coming in, and those are 2 big reasons why those first 2 are powering forward.  Just requires investors to be fine with the post-Covid situation of Amazon's retail ops, which I think don't have downside left at this point; stock's consolidated over a year now +/- 400.|2021-10-27 10:16:42

iae8ab|qgt5w7|qgt5w7|3|listen up. im not very clever but I've been skimming trough some annual reports. Many companies increased their operating cash flows last year, but lots of the increased operating  cash flow was really just reduction of inventories. I think they have to increase the inventories at some point and operating cash flows go down just like they went up. SuPPLy CHaiN iSsuEs reeeee. Companies that carry inventory. Just look something like Nike. But nike is quite efficient and streamlined I guess so have a look at some not so efficient that have huge & expensive inventories.|2021-10-27 14:50:30

(literally only half of a bio that i copy and pasted from one of these accounts) with Soviet Propaganda posters as their banner image  i'm not even saying anything about agreeing with them or not, just what's with the obsession with these labels and groups idk what half this shit means. and why where it so openly like that where's the motivation to learn through discussion  some of these accounts i even like honestly since a lot of them actually are intelligent with interesting takes, it's just so bizarre to me. i can't imagine they have jobs or non-online social lives|2021-10-27 06:34:10

He had a big investor firm mentor and "played" the market for a bit until I met him in a class, I eventually asked if he could mentor me and he happily agreed, but he never.actually.did.it...  So, I have no money sitting on legit nothing (put into perspective I cannot even own a Facebook stock atm.) I was just trying to figure out how to eventually after saving make my way in? Always is a risk I know, but I cannot do options, I can baerly do day trading, and if you cannot do options you cannot really do futures either, so kinda lost. Amy advice or help?|2021-10-27 05:48:13
