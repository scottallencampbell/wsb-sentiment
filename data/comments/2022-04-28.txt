3bval2|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|4|Question for you guys about the wash rule. I’ve been scalping CLNE for several weeks and have sold off portions of my position along the way for profit. I’ve also added even more shares along the way to average down in order to keep my total position above market price. This triggered the wash rule through my broker and also added $0.30 per share to my cost basis. My question is, since I only sold for gains why would my cost basis go up after triggering a wash sale? Would this be because when I averaged down, my initial investment was currently below market price when I sold even though my total investment was above current market price?|2021-06-28 10:25:20

3cpxbk|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|4|GME has to rebalance at the close. MOC auction imbalance gets posted to dealers about now secretly, then to everyone else at 3:45. I bought $40k of mostly OTM puts expiring friday.  The reason is that I think the index funds need to sell 5m shares, and they are going to try to do it all in the MOC in order to preserve tracking. That if it shows up in MOC will tank the price 10% or more.   If I am wrong, I just sell the puts before the close and probably don't lose money, or not much. If I'm right, I make a ton.|2021-06-28 14:08:08

Been hard at work at Amazon for 6 days straight while he and my stepmom have nowhere to be all day every day but it’s somehow my responsibility to keep inventory and save what I bought so their child can have milk. Not to mention it’s not a big deal if she goes one morning without milk. Can’t tell ME to be an adult here without being a hypocrite.

3cuohg|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|6|I know I’m screaming into the void here but just wanted to give you the heads up to maybe make some money. Sometime in Q3 (looks like next month), the Sprott physical uranium trust is going to ipo on NYSE, allowing everyone to buy physical uranium, except uranium production has been at a standstill for a long time due to few miners who can economically mine at the current price. If they buy enough, there will be a massive supply squeeze just as uranium consumers (utilities) need to start renewing their contracts. And what happens when an industry goes from losing money to making bank overnight? I am trying to front run this. Right now is the dip before the rip. Either buy now or be prepared to rush into the squeeze when it blows up. This is totally unlike the “silver squeeze” because uranium is dangerous and more tightly regulated.

3cwgj9|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|5|Workhorse is about to hit the big red candle formed after it had lost the USPS contract to oshkosh. Since then it has been shorted to hell despite having a strong future in electric vehicles and even drones. Deals have been in the works with Ikea and UPS looming near. Today WKHS is finishing its inverse head and shoulders, this combined with the short interest it has acquired leads me to believe that its looking at a run towards the 27 dollar marker left before its big fateful red candle.   Also a beautiful cup forming this past week!        IMO could be the last time to buy in on it before some sweet gains. Good luck to all!|2021-06-28 14:55:21

3cbp2p|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|5|Why is it when I see someone shilling GME they seem to just be drunk idiots cheering on their own inebriation. But when I see someone shilling silver they seem to be trying to convert me to an MLM founded on a conspiracy that the moon landing isn't real and Walt Disney is alive and working on a silver mine for the illuminati and if I don't accept silver as my personal savior I'll be damned to hell.  In theory they both should want as many converts as possible, but one comes across as people dancing in the field at a concert, and the other as door to door missionaries selling commemorative plates.  Do the silver shills even call themselves silverbacks? If not, they're way too self-serious to consider.  Edit: I'll give the silver folks credit for not using baby talk.|2021-06-28 12:25:44

3brcty|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|2|"The porn industry has clearly diversified, in terms of consumer tastes. However, it remains a question whether the porn industry *creates the supply*, as in Say's Law, or simply responds to the fetishes and kinks of its consumers. For one, research that was carried out from 2000 to 2016 showed that the nature of pornographic films has altered almost irreversibly in the past decade. It has become more fetish-based and more extreme, while penis length and breast size has also increased."  \- *The Porn Industry and its Discontents*, by Joe A. Walsh|2021-06-28 09:55:01

3btp1m|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|1|Need some math help here.  Jeffrey’s is saying this GameStop Russell thing will make index funds must sell 5 million shares than they will buy. Because they don’t care about the price just about getting the closing price to enter or exit, most of those shares will happen at the close auction or with a dark pool doing the same.  So if 5 million shares got sold by GameStop to raise capital and that was a selloff of like 30% over a couple weeks, what will the stock price do at 4pm when index funds attempt to sell 5 million shares in a 15 second period?🤔  Any math experts here?|2021-06-28 10:13:12

3bryuu|o9h5w0|o9h5w0|0|"The dangers of porn are often overstated. For example, a school district ran a campaign decrying the ill effects of pornography on the penis length of their students, claiming that watching more porn would result in shorter penile length. No study has ever been conducted to prove this. On the other hand, no corresponding study has been made to prove otherwise. The problem with most anti-porn campaigns is not the zealousness of their conduct, but rather than unsubstantiated claims that concerned parents often make in lieu of scientific evidence."  \- *The Porn Industry and its Discontents*, by Joe A.
