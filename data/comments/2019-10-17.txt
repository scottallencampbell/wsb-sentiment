Treasuries led a government bond retreat.  The mood of investors had been cautious earlier in both Asia and Europe, but risk appetite returned as the U.K. and European Union said they agreed on a new withdrawal plan. Initial optimism was tempered however, as the accord must be approved by EU leaders and British MPs. A key Northern Irish party said it won‚Äôt vote for the deal.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed as every major national¬†benchmark¬†in the region turned higher, while contracts for the three main U.S. equity gauges followed the advance. Gold slipped alongside bonds as haven demand ebbed. A gauge of the dollar also dropped.|2019-10-17 06:16:46

43vgvz|dj4t45|dj4t45|3|By Hilary Russ  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fast-food chicken chain Chick-fil-A is turning the tables on in-house dining, unveiling a new sit-down table service through its app that means customers will not have to wait at the counter to order.  On Thursday, the privately owned restaurant operator announced "dine-in mobile ordering," when guests in or on their way to a store can order through the Chick-fil-A app on their mobile phones.  After finding a seat, guests tap their phones to their corresponding table numbers and an employee will bring the meal to the table.  Most big restaurant operators are trying out new technology - at drive-thrus, counters, kitchens and delivery services - to speed food orders.  In September, McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) acquired Apprente, a voice-technology startup focused initially on drive-thru ordering, with plans to look later at using new voice technology for mobile ordering or kiosks.  In tests that began last year at 80 Chick-fil-A stores in five local markets, large parties and families with children in particular said they liked the dine-in mobile service.  "This technology will be particularly helpful for busy parents who can now head straight into the restaurant and have their meal brought to their table at their convenience, without waiting in line," said Khalilah Cooper, Chick-fil-A director of service and hospitality, in a statement.  #LONG COCKüêì|2019-10-17 15:52:51

I lost about $1.5k USD in my first month of trading options and as a student i can't sustain more losses.  Here are some things i learned to increase your chances of winning:  &#x200B;  * Never go against the market, unless you are absolutely confident (and even think, think twice). Buy your options in the direction of the market. I know OTM cheap options are enticing because X company is undervalued and is going to pump... but please resist that thought. * Buy out your options several months in advance, even if they cost more. They cost more because you are less likely to lose your money. * Buy options ITM always.   I'll still browse but i am not longer participating. May your fortune not be like mine.|2019-10-17 09:54:11

42banh|dj4t45|dj4t45|5|Let's talk about soybeans. Trump claims phase 1 includes China buying $50 billion in soybeans. That's not realistic and here's why. China was transitioning away from American soybeans even BEFORE the trade war started. In the year 2017 they only bought $24 billion in soybeans. In the past 12 months they only bought $9.2 billion in soybeans.     For them to buy $50 billion in soybeans, they would have to buy at 2017 levels, with NO tariffs applied on the soybeans, for TWO YEARS.     So in other words $50 billion in soybeans is literally made up and a bullshit lie.|2019-10-17 11:27:47
