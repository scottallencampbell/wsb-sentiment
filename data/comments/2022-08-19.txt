If you charged more for swallowing ($30 a dick) and could swallow about 12 loads a day, and suck an additional 16 dicks to lower your overall dick intake by 6 dicks a day, and while I've never sucked a dick I am pretty sure 6 less dicks a day would be worth the dozen loads, which would actually negate the need for packing a lunch and save you more money there too.|2022-08-19 12:04:35

kwxnni|wsa0in|wsa0in|67|***A little advice for those who had a rough day in the market after hours yesterday:***   Be careful of those who slyly shift their sales pitch every time their get rich quick scheme fails, to keep you from withdrawing your money. They don't know more than you, they don't care if you make money, they just don't want you to sell so that they can do it before you do. All the essays written last night are damage control to salvage their own portfolios by selling a new fantasy, don't let them convince you a dog in a party hat is a unicorn.  Just because you've lost 50% of your money doesn't obligate you to stubbornly lose the other 50% too. Try to unemotionally evaluate - if you could take that 50% and buy something now, would it be the thing you're in?  If not, sell and put your money the place you think it will net you the most.   &nbsp;  I've taken 6 figure losses before, I've also made back everything I lost and more, and it never involved me trying to time the top of a pump and dump. Look for opportunities, trade smart, learn from your mistakes, and don't stubbornly depend on hopes and dreams to make you rich.|2022-08-19 05:05:11

The dip in gas prices is only a temporary reprieve that's minorly helping inflation.  Watch Putin fuck the world up in the winter when he shuts all gas off to Europe.  Then you got housing and rental prices that still keep going up and never go back down, which is a major chunk of CPI.  A fed pivot based off only 1 or 2 data points.... what a joke. Soon the picture will become clearer that inflation is sticky and difficult to bring down, and the Fed won't be able to release their foot off the gas of rate hikes.  This shit won't be a soft landing, but an absolute inferno.  Anyone who thinks there's gonna be a soft landing and a Fed pivot already probably believed in inflation is transitory and inflation is a Putin price hike too.|2022-08-19 07:32:42

kyv1wc|wsa0in|wsa0in|7|Honestly all of this pain is completely the bulls' fault. Had they not sh√≥rt squeezed the market we would have already seen the bottom at 330 about a week ago. Instead they did a ghey 10 week pump that extended this bear market at least another 3-6 months that could have capitulated already and started a new bull run. Instead they loosened financial conditions, inflation fight is much harder, and now the fed now has to go harder. Oh well more opportunity for bears to have a better ride and opportunity down even harder to 300.  #üêÇ=ü§°|2022-08-19 13:37:31

kyzx7g|wsa0in|wsa0in|2|**Cineworld group needs to repurpose some theaters into betting game arenas.**      Everyone pays $5 to play and has to stake $20 or more depending on the event. Then they are handed a tablet and they go to their designated theater room. Inside that room are 60 players who have all staked $20.     Players participate in a variety of games ranging from trivia, sports betting, esports betting maybe betting on BTC price movements, etc.     For example, for a BTC event, players must stake at least $20 but can stake up to $200.   Every minute they are asked a simple question: Green or Red. Players place bets ranging from $1 to $5 on if the next candle will be Green or Red and payouts are determined by the ratio of Green to Red bets where house takes a 1% fee on every bet. That's 1% a minute for all you apes which compounds pretty fast.     Shit I'd love to do nothing more than to eat pizza in a theater betting on candle colors with my fellow apes.     On Esports, it could be like a League watch party. At the start of the match bets are placed on simple things like "First blood", "First Tower Kill". Some bets are open the whole time like "which team wins", "Most CS", and then there are other milestone bets that come and go like "First Dragon", "Second Dragon", etc.   **Shit this would make SO MUCH FUCKING MONEY**|2022-08-19 14:09:23

It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútake a certain amount of volume to push it up or down‚Äù. That number can move up or down with practically no volume because it‚Äôs simply the last price two parties agreed to trade at.

kx46cy|wsa0in|wsa0in|-3|Prior to yesterday, there was tons of DD about how $BBBY was going to moon.   - The company has reshuffled the board to encourage future growth - Despite the failing retail, the new credit card line is the company‚Äôs future - Short interest >100% - Stock is 52% shorts - Ryan Cohen said he was in all the way until 60-80%  To make that last point clear, a good number of investors, including myself, were only in on the ride simply because they believed that Ryan Cohen was some financial genius and he must be seeing something no one else is.   The same mindset holds true for his sale. Why did he pull out? Was he just pumping and dumping for the lulz? Or did he see something in the company that made him lose faith?  With that said, all other DD remains the same. Since last night, the board has not changed, the company‚Äôs shift towards credit cards has not changed, and I bet the stock is heavily shorted, maybe even moreso now.|2022-08-19 06:18:18

kxdj0q|wsa0in|wsa0in|-1|NRDY   I have been a shareholder since it was valued at about 9 dollars. I sincerely believe that it shall constitute the future of teaching; the predictions that online learning would be done are ridiculous, firstly, with US school districts actively increasing their orders with the company; many still chose to learn at home as well, and it is especially useful to use for homework and centralised and standardised education; that is not to mention the fact that it is also used as training for non-school-age persons; it also saw a slump in revenue as to be expected since about half of Q2 is not the school year. Q3 and Q1 are often their best times; many large banks still hold their positions in the company, and they would absolutely not do so if they thought NRDY was due to be going nowhere. The absolute best part, however, is the fact that they have NO DEBT and something like $130m in cash on their balance sheet, so are in a perfect prime position to expand in the current times when interest rates are so high|2022-08-19 07:41:52

ky3zp6|wsa0in|wsa0in|-1|How does it work when someone with a decent enough % to be considered an insider sells? Or even when a company has a shelf offering?   It just seems that every single time I hear about insiders selling or the company having a shelf offer, the volume and volatility get crazy to an extent that just doesn‚Äôt seem natural for what‚Äôs happening.    Like with the bbby sale ‚Äî RC and the fake ginger kid selling ALL their shares in one day would have made up less than 10% of the volume from ONE day. Is the rest of that volume retail? It just doesn‚Äôt seem possible with the number of shares the company has outstanding.  And how would the price ONLY tank AFTER it is completed? Like that just doesn‚Äôt really make sense and I‚Äôve seen the exact type of stuff happen practically every time a similar action occurs.    TLDR for you edgy retards, every single time an insider sells or a company has a shelf offering, volume goes into the stratosphere to an extent that doesn‚Äôt even remotely make sense.
