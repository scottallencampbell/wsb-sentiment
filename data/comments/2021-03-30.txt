su2k7y|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|8|I work for a company that has incredibly strong ties to the automotive industry. Tomorrow’s infrastructure bill could be huge for EV. Here’s why:  The number one thing that is stopping electric vehicles from going mainstream is the charging stations. It’s pretty much a chicken and the egg scenario.  On one hand, you need charging stations to charge a car when you are on the road. However, these are very expensive for the OEMs. They recoup these costs by selling more EVs. But to sell an EV you need the charging stations.  Additionally, most OEMs tend to use their own proprietary plugs, adding to the complexity of this problem.  Thus, if we solve the problem of EV charging stations, we solve the problem for EVs going mainstream. I’ve been hearing that EV charging stations are a big part of tomorrow’s infrastructure deal.|2021-03-30 14:33:30

ssnt57|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|22|I love how GME folks seem to understand that GME is currently massively overpriced, which is fine, as their thesis is based on a short squeeze.  But then they also spam GME headlines about new board members and stuff, as if they are investing in a regular, fairly-priced stock that will rally on good news.  It can't be both. You can't be betting on a short squeeze and also be betting on a fair valuation, as those two things are in conflict. I feel like most of these people don't even know what their goal is anymore.|2021-03-30 08:01:20

ssq79v|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|5|so I learned about this ancient punishment called "ordeal of the boats".   Essentially, they would take two canoes, and lash them together one on top of another. Holes would be cut out for the head, arms and legs. Then they would put the criminal inside, with their head and limbs hanging out. They would then force feed milk and honey to the prisoner (to induce diarrhea) and smear honey on their faces and limbs. Then they would put the boats out on a calm lake in the hot sun. The insects would get attracted to the honey, and the diarrhea, and lay eggs. The insects, and larvae would then eat the prisoner alive.  Sources say, one of the prisoners took 17 days to die.    Sounds like a good punishment for QQQ.|2021-03-30 08:23:28

sscltv|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|9|The big story is still Archegos Capital. Yesterday I said this didn’t look like an LTCM-type of systemic event. This morning that view appears vindicated.   Couple of reasons for this. For one, financial stocks would be on the front line of any massive unwind as many of these banks were/are counterparties not only to Archegos, but to its counterparties. But that fallout appears limited to Nomura and Credit Suisse. The XLF (ETF that tracks financials) is up 0.7% in the pre-market.   Then you have the stocks that were at the center of Archegos’ implosion (or cover images for the story, at least): Viacom and Discovery. Both saw extensive selling from Friday through yesterday but are up in the pre-market today: VIAC by about 6%, DISCA by 1.5%. (Yeah there are a bunch of Chinese internet stocks that also figured into this story, but they have other issues affecting them).  Finally, you have the news coverage of the story. These have moved on from what you would call ‘first day’ news pieces to post-mortem type of things. A quick sample of the headlines this morning:  * “How Archegos’ $20 billion decision led to banks’ share prices tumbling”: CNBC;  * “What is Archegos and how did it rattle the stock market?” WSJ;  * “Archegos Capital blowup: What investors need to know”: Bloomberg;  * “Goldman U-turn on Hwang put bank at nexus of margin call”: Bloomberg;  Knowing a thing or two about newsrooms (from experience), I can tell you there is no way anybody would have time or interest to pursue projects like this if the bigger story about Archegos was still developing.    Things could certainly still (d)evolve from here. There may be pockets of information about Archegos that could cause fear in the broader market. But for all intents and purposes, the story would appear to be done. In a few weeks you may have already forgotten about it.  Back to today’s markets: Ten-year yields have quietly climbed north of 1.7%. Maybe the inflation story will surface again|2021-03-30 05:50:16

sskbav|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|4|Do I have this right about the hedge fund domino-effect   Market/ economic destruction might be unravelling. Here is how: (short term debt cycle & long term debt cycle)  Because of low interest rates funding investment with credit is very lucrative ->  hedgefunds get over-leveraged ->  Over-leveraged hedgefund get margin called. They are forced to liquidate. Which means they sell a lot at once driving the price dratiscally down  (like seen in the blocktrades from our boy hwang) ->  This is bad if a lot of funds are over-leveraged. Because the total amount spend drives the market that is either paid by money or credit.  If you spend more someone else income increases. That means if someone spends less someone else’s income decreases.   Credit is volatile.  if borrowers get margin called credit is wiped out. Credit wiped out equals less spending.  ->  Here you get a downward-spiral where one persons spending equals another persons income (over and over again) Less and Less spending will drive the market down.|2021-03-30 07:26:14

Well, like me Carvana is down about 20% for the month, but that $10 of stock has still grown 425% for the year. Rough times we're in, but patience, AND forgetfulness, pays off.|2021-03-30 08:17:29

Going for a date and strike to get a $4000 premium off rip. Set that aside to service the card and/or buy back shares if the opportunity presents itself. GME probably has pretty good support down to $120 right now. Strikes and dates I feel safe selling without getting assigned are paying a 30% premium right now. Wish me luck.  P.S.

Discount that cash flow you fucking retarded boomer fucks.   Love the agate Cathie got for TSLA price target.

stktj9|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|6|   # AMC Executives Sell Large Amounts of Stock -- Barrons.com  BY Dow Jones \&amp; Company, Inc.   — 6:59 AM ET 03/29/2021  AMC Entertainment ( [AMC](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=AMC)   📷Loading...) stock has rocketed so far in 2021 in volatile trading, and executives of the theater chain recently have sold large amounts of stock, after selling none last year. In fact, for three out of four of the executives, these are their first stock sales on the open market on record.  AMC stock has soared nearly 400% year to date, fueled by so-called meme trading. At one point, when shares hit $20.36 in January, they were trading at nearly 10 times the year-end price of $2.12. The S&P 500 index has managed to rise only 5.8% so far this year.  The four executives sold a total of nearly $3 million of AMC stock earlier this month. AMC didn't immediately respond to a request to make them available for comment on their stock sales.  The selling was led by Stephen Colanero, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, who sold 100,000 AMC shares on March 23 for $1.1 million, or $10.52 each on average. He now owns 108,879 shares, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Colanero, who has been with the company since 2009, last sold stock in June 2018, receiving $86,000 for 5,364 shares, a per-share average of $15.95.  Kevin Connor, senior VP, general counsel, and secretary, sold a total of 72,358 AMC shares over March 16 and 17 for $982,600, a per-share average of $13.58. Connor, who has been with the company since June 2007, now owns 65,884 AMC shares.  Elizabeth Frank, executive VP, worldwide programming and chief content officer, sold 40,000 AMC shares on March 16 for $542,400, an average price of $13.56 each. Frank, who has been in her post since July 2012, now owns 173,780 AMC shares.  Chris Cox, senior VP and chief accounting officer, sold 29,068 AMC shares on March 16 for $373,800, a per-share average price of $12.86. Cox, who was named to his current position more than a decade ago, now owns 42,000 shares.  AMC executives aren't the only recent stock sellers. Private-equity firm Silver Lake, which had been one of the company's largest investors, sold its entire stake in January for $713 million.

ssb0un|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|3|what's with people buying AMC?  It's been 2 months since I've even heard what "shares" and "options" were because I'm new at this but from what information I've gathered, why is AMC even attractive?  Theaters are still pretty fucked in the states because of COVID19 until after may - june-ish when vaccines roll out for healthy people and even then it's going to take some time for people to get the vaccines and be safe enough to go to them, movie production is pretty stalled too and it'll take time before they're able to get into creating movies again with the lack of them syphoning more audience to different mediums like online streaming services.  If I knew what fundamentals were, I'd say that's bad fundamentals.  is it just the possibility of a squeeze that's getting people to buy it?|2021-03-30 05:26:17

st1viq|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|2|AMC has two paths forward:  1. The vote dilution happens, which I believe will happen because what the board wants it will probably get. Then, the stock is diluted to the tune of %100!! The stock tumbles worse than VIAC and DISCA as 500,000,000 shares dilute the stock price, which causes new retail to flee and AMC can then start rebuilding and might be able to get out from those high interest debts and be profitable in a few years  2. The vote dilution gets voted down by short term investors and AMC gets a small bounce. Then, the company, who obviously needed that liquidity to stay afloat or else why would they even risk looking that incredibly weak by putting %100 dilution to a vote, slowly grinds away and loses everything and all the "hold" and " buy the dip" clowns ride their accounts to zero.   In my opinion, there is no obvious path forward for investors unless you are super long, but the stock has been diluted so many times your money is better spent pretty much anywhere else in the market. Plus, if you are very long you are bringing into play the fact that Covid is changing the streaming game and new release expectations. People like to scream about studio contracts to theaters chains, but the reality is the studios will follow the money and more and more the streaming services themselves are becoming the biggest movie producers.|2021-03-30 09:59:14

sts15x|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|2|I think the unfortunate situation for PLTR is this. With the previous run up, there was massive bullish option activity. MMs hedged against the delta for every one of those calls and subsequently had a short term loss on their books.  &#x200B;  Well now the situation is that big institutions (1) have a shit ton of shares already, and (2) they are recouping the previous short term loss on those calls through theta decay. So there's not going to be any buying pressure due to the first point, and the large open interest on OTM means that gamma exposure has already been taken into account. There's no mechanism to push it past 25 until a significant portion of those options expire.  &#x200B;  Shit sucks and I am long, but it has eaten away at a huge amount of my portfolio thus far.|2021-03-30 13:14:30

stu88q|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|2|AMZN reminds me of the Roman/Persian/Mongol Empires. They're way too bloated and proving to suck at customer service.

sscjbd|mgcgcy|mgcgcy|-8|I feel so fucking bad. My bird has been screaming insanely loud earlier and earlier in the morning and I thought she was just trying to get me to wake up and feed her earlier so when she does go on long enough to stop me from sleeping I've been doing stuff like bang on her cage or put it on the front porch for a few minutes or whatever I can to give her negative feedback because there are almost no forms of positive feedback she can recognize to train her by that. But I just noticed it's that the season change put her spot right where the sun hits first in the morning and she just wanted help with the sun hitting her eyes waking her up in such a brutal unpleasant way just like I was so frustrated with her for. And when it occurred to me before that this could be the problem I ignored it on the logic that she would just move herself into the shade if that was it, as if she's not a bird with a brain the size of a raisin. Now I'm just sitting here crying over the fact that I was so mad at her when she just wanted help with the same problem as me and I was too much of an asshole to understand. I bought these pet birds thinking my depression could get better and I'd take good care of them but now I've turned into a piece of shit who can get legitimately angry at a fucking bird and I can't actually get better no matter how badly I want to. I don't understand why natural selection had to make me give so much of a shit about things yet be so incapable of coping and so alone against everyone else that I can't do anything but fuck up and hate myself. Like, either don't put my DNA together in a way that makes a person who gives a shit about things, or if you do, put some female humans on earth who give a shit about stuff too so that life is enjoyable, or if you're not even going to do that, make the giving a shit about things come with the strength to cope with life being shit. This design is just fucking stupid.|2021-03-30 05:49:14
