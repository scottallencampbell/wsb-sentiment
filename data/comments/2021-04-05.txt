Check out any Target (TGT) or Zara (ITX) S-1 report or even a fucking boomer like Nike (NKE) and you see even better online numbers _and_ growth.

tfur83|mkh463|mkh463|22|Stock futures are pointing upward, with small caps leading the charge. Russell 2000 up 1.5%. Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all up around 0.5% to 0.7%. That’s as of 0630.  This follows a better-than-anticipated nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. About 916k jobs added in March versus 647k expected. The fact that leisure and hospitality were the biggest contributors shows that the economic recovery is gathering pace in the areas that were hardest hit by the pandemic.  Seeing how stock markets were closed on Friday, we may be playing a bit of catchup to that news now.  On today’s economic calendar, we have ISM non-manufacturing PMI out at 0945. That should shed more light on the services sector of the economy. A reading of 59 is anticipated. Last month that figure fell well short of forecasts.  At some point if all these economic figures keep beating estimates, the inflation drum is going to start beating again. That will bring concerns about tighter Fed policy. We played this game last month and inflation concerns seemed to win out at times, even though the Fed stuck to its guns.   Looks like that will not be the story for today. Bond markets are quiet so far, with 10-year yields mostly unchanged around 1.718%. Crude oil is down almost 2% but that’s due to OPEC production increases. Copper is higher though, by about 2.6%.|2021-04-05 05:44:51

tfti4p|mkh463|mkh463|36|My take on what the share offering does. If you actually read and believe the DD about the new vision of the company and eccomerce and gaming then revenue up is good news and share offering is good news. They need money to fund that change and want to have a healthy cash balance in case of a massive deleveraging.   If you just believe in the squeeze then this has to go through the SEC first. The government. Slow as hell. Meanwhile DFV will presumably exercise his contracts by 4/16 and the blackout period ends around the same time. Dont led FUD control you, think about all the variables at hand and make your own decision. I like the stock. Not financial advice. Pos 5 shares  Edit: 🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌|2021-04-05 05:26:53

th4yff|mkh463|mkh463|8|Reddit asking what my thought are. Sure thing, Reddit, I'll let you know.     I have gone through the five stages of Grief, a.k.a "5 stages of Palantir".     1) Denial as in "How could this soon-to-surpass-30$ stock go all the way to 20 and then take a dump every other day so it keeps teasing 23 and back down she goes!".     2) Anger as in "YOU PIECE OF @#\~€¬¿?!!!!" as market is green like grass and PLTR takes yet another dump. Or it goes up a tiny bit and insiders sell it into oblivion.     3) Bargaining as in "Ok, ok, I may be able to sell if it goes back to 26. Make it 25. Ok, I'll settle for 24. Is it too much 23.75 to ask?".     4) Depression as in "I could have made so much money elsewhere and I'm stuck with this dumpster fire of a stock...".     5) Acceptance as in "Palantir will do Palantir things. Stop looking at it funny every 3 minutes and eventually you'll break even and move along to pursue other venues".     I regret nothing...except not having sold today at 24.40. I fucking knew she would tease me and purple ball me back into low 22s :(      Morale of the story: if life gives you a second chance, take it.

tgqpxy|mkh463|mkh463|10|Can't believe how out of control this bubble has become. And not just in stocks. Real estate, fake internet gold, trading cards, etc. Virtually every industry. I think the crash will be more like the dot com bubble, where we just lose a lot of value and not economies collapsing like the housing...however homes will lose significant value still, particularly in certain localized areas. As for the markets, I 100% stand by my prediction of SPY back to 200 before year end. Which is slightly over a 50% correction at this point. Of course it will be oversold at that point and probably start climbing to 300-350 range rather quickly, where I think it will end the year. But with the amount of margin and unknowledgeable retail traders in this market, you can bet the selling will be over-emphasized when it happens.|2021-04-05 10:48:51

tfu56s|mkh463|mkh463|12|GME premarket shows its down to 172.68 (-10%), but even if they immediately sold all 3.5M shares, if the market cap is to remain constant then the price should only drop to 182.33(-5%). IMO this means the 10% dip is irrational and should really only be a 5% drop.  Calling it now GME will be 182 by EOD. RemindMe! 1 day|2021-04-05 05:36:11

tge8uh|mkh463|mkh463|-10|NIO, PLUG, GME still holding! I have panick sold before, 9 times out of 10, at a loss, and then watched em spike to sometimes record highs the next day or that same week. I foresaw the AMC situation when it was <$3 I bought I believe 100 shares, I sold em at a 10 cent loss after a week or so because I was still new to it and was advised by a friend with a lot more experience, to not buy it and to get rid of what I had and so i did. I would have made a shit ton on that especially for being brand new to the market but I listened to someone else and didnt take my own chance on it. I wont advise to hold/buy/sell anything for that very reason, go with your gut and your own research and take the chance if you can afford to, dont just do what a stranger on the internet says too, but read up on the information this sub provides. Lastly leave your emotions out of it, trade on knowledge not how your feeling that day, stonks take dips and even dives sometimes, if you are at a huge loss and everytime you look at your portfolio it's worse, and stressing you out close the app for a few days give it some time because stocks have to eventually move back the other way. I'm not an advisor, and definitely not the most experienced compared to most on here, but seeing the divide and rumors over the past week or so, I figured I'd offer some small advice to those who it could help. God speed, let's all get rich my fellow short bus riders!|2021-04-05 09:10:14

tg8uve|mkh463|mkh463|1|I have a dumb question... but doesn't owning **ANY** stock basically work as a hedge against inflation?  Not just gold or housing or whatever?  Like, lets say there was 25% inflation over 5 years, just to pick random numbers... wouldn't the market cap of Apple or Broadcomm or whatever else essentially just be 25% higher as well?  They are selling products... and their prices for supplies would go up, then their prices on their products would go up as well, so their revenues would go up, so their earnings would go up, so their MC would go up?|2021-04-05 08:22:43

th3zq1|mkh463|mkh463|0|Tesla (TSLA) article...  “Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock price is up big due to its recent production and delivery numbers for the first quarter of 2021. Here are some reasons to be excited about the stock.   Production/delivery numbers: Tesla released its Q1 production and delivery numbers that beat Wall Street expectations, even with the material shortage that forced its California plant to shut down for a few days.  Price target increase: Analysts have begun to increase price targets for the company. The most notable was Wedbush, with a price target of $1,000. Strong fundamentals: Tesla is currently profitable, positive in cash flow from operations, has strong growth expectations, and has a healthy cash-to-debt ratio.”  _______  Source: https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/05/3-reasons-investors-are-bullish-on-tesla/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article|2021-04-05 12:28:25
