1khhaa|tj88zu|tj88zu|3|alright whos retarded enough to be shorting BBY rn? They're bigly profitable and they sell shit that people cant wait for shipping on. I spent all last year deploying computers for people that would pay an extra $500 to have a computer today because they didn't plan ahead and their new hires needed it now as opposed to waiting 2-4 days for amazon. That isnt going away bc companies are still hiring tech positions like crazy and neither manufacturers nor amazon can keep up.  We did 7 figures with Dell annually and even with the discounts from having a corporate account the time frames for delivery were often the killer. The entire IT industry has been in shambles over computer parts for over a year now and we frequently had to source from Best Buy or other local retailers just to make deadlines.  I have 2x $BBY Jan'24 $100C, looking to add 2-3 more on the next dip and ride out this wave.

Perhaps it‚Äôs fate that today is the 21st of March and you will once again be fighting for our freedom not from market makers, hedge funds, or manipulation but from annihilation.  We‚Äôre fighting for our right to live, to exist, and should we win today the 21st of March will no longer be known as an American holiday but as the day when the world declared in one voice,  We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. We‚Äôre going to live on. We‚Äôre going to survive. Today we celebrate our Getting Tendies Day!  &#x200B;  Edit:  Yeah I know we're already open, I didn't think of this until just now, so suck me off.|2022-03-21 09:11:00

1kljp7|tj88zu|tj88zu|1|What if inflation turns out to be transitory? Not that it‚Äôs going away but just coming back to a more stable rate and dropping some without the fed hiking 7-8 times?  No way I hear you say. How would that happen? Well if you are making a call on elevated inflation you‚Äôre in many ways making a call on consumer demand and essentially making a call on the strength of the economy.  But what‚Äôs happened over the past few months is that 30 year mortgages have gone to 5% in a straight line and oil has gone to $110+ a barrel. All of this has created a very loud narrative about how bad things are and how they are only going to get worse. Throw in the fact that the stock market corrected 15-25% in most areas (some much more). There‚Äôs many other factors- student loan payments resuming, etc.  What does all that do? It has a massively negative impact on consumer sentiment and unsurprisingly this has started showing up in consumer sentiment surveys. When people suddenly feel poor they slow their spending. Fewer vacations, fewer discretionary purchases, less eating out, etc. Yes people have to eat so there may not be a major drop in food prices but that‚Äôs only part of CPI. Add in more and more companies increasing their supply chains and it‚Äôs not hard to imagine major inventory overhangs in the next year or two if demand starts to slow.  Not saying this will happen btw, just something to consider. The stock market gets its cues from the bond market. The bond market gets its cues from the fed. The fed gets its cues from the loudest narrative. The loudest narrative comes from CPI. If there‚Äôs even the slightest chance CPI begins to abate the market can definitely rally.|2022-03-21 14:57:12
