f7szky|vtf0g7|vtf0g7|7|Technicals in utter shambles. Long post alert.   May be a short term  (5d) bullish channel forming. 389, 393 and 396 being key points. Could see 396 Monday? Would be the absolute top without breaking the 4 month bear trend. Channel from the absolute top in January is all the way up at 440, very doubtful thats in play.   No short term bearish trend, but a massive and unbroken long term one. Volume has been very weak since breaking under the long term bear trend and coming back into it mid June.   Tl;Dr bulls may be getting a nice rally to 400 next couple days. I'd say buy calls, on technical grounds, but I'm not gonna do it myself because volume isn't convincing and fundamentals are as bearish as I could ever imagine them being. So don't get too cocky about it. Will be closing puts and going on the sidelines. Until 396 or momentum reversal.|2022-07-07 10:17:58

f8ught|vtf0g7|vtf0g7|6|Is there anyone who unironically believes this rally is justified from a macro pov? If so could you explain?   Bloomberg always explains the days move in such a way that you either think ‘yes duh’, or ‘so that’s why this is happening’, or ‘now you’re just grasping at straws’ and today is decidedly the latter.   Economy cooling means inflation is…. Still incredibly high but maybe it has peaked? So what? Means the fed might take it’s foot of the brake oh wait they want inflation to go down way more? Samsung earnings were ok so maybe it won’t be so bad? But I thought the economy was cooling?   It makes zero sense to me. It just seems like in the next few days or maybe around CPI or earnings we will reverse course and Bloomberg will just write ‘investors are still concerned by high inflation and a bleak economic outlook’ or some shit|2022-07-07 14:19:33

f90chd|vtf0g7|vtf0g7|3|My predictions: Too many cross currents to have conviction on anything right now. I think CPI will likely come in less than expected (8.7%) and markets will briefly rally, especially tech.  But QT hasn't even started in earnest yet. 94% of market thinks Fed will increase by 75bps on 7/27 (6% believe 50bps increase). Even though 75bps is priced in, market will probably stall on 7/27 or 7/28 after JP speaks.  If anything, I'd buy some SPX calls as a hedge since I'm 75% in cash right now but I'll wait to see if we're down tomorrow before doing that.|2022-07-07 14:57:32

f8kw1v|vtf0g7|vtf0g7|2|I wonder if people continuing to keep buying these dips will lead to an even worse sell off when it eventually comes. If let’s say half your portfolio is cash and half stocks, and your stocks have a bad week and are down 15%, your entire portfolio only goes down 7%. But if you continue to buy the dip and buy the dip, and have 100% of your portfolio in stocks, when those stocks lose 15%, now your whole portfolio is down 15%. I think these people who keep piling in will eventually be worn out and start to pull the plug. Once people start pulling out entire portfolios, the selling will obviously be larger than if they had not gone full port in the first place. And I think this will create a waterfall effect for a quick selling event that devastates markets. We will probably have several more dips and rally’s for people to buy into, before they can buy no more. Once inflows start to drop off should be a telling point.|2022-07-07 13:18:18

I’m sure there’s plenty of people like me. And there is no way in hell I’m missing out on another potential bottom. I’ll off myself if that happens. Seriously.   It’s why there’s so much dip-buying going on. Mass psyche of trying to catch what could be the last big dip for the next decade.   On we go, bulls. Ride or die.|2022-07-07 08:05:28

f7t4md|vtf0g7|vtf0g7|2|For the week ending July 2, there were 235,000 unemployment claims filed, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.      What Happened: The seasonally adjusted figure for first-time claims was 235,000; this is an increase of 4,000 from last week's figure of 231,000.      The number of new claims surpassed the four-week moving average of 232,500.     In addition to an increase from last week’s reporting, this figure represents the highest unemployment claim number since Jan. 15.       With the amount of new claims surpassing the moving average, a grim trend has begun to form. The figure is higher than the Dow Jones analyst expectation of 230,000 claims. |2022-07-07 10:18:55

f6v06d|vtf0g7|vtf0g7|1|Can someone ELI5 and include either an example or a link that demonstrates why a stock dividend will negatively affect short sellers in a way that a traditional split wouldn’t?  - stock dividend will encourage lenders to recall their shares so they can receive the dividend.   I don’t think this checks out because their loaned portion will adjust proportionately. If you loaned out 100 shares, now you loaned out 400 shares and can recall them.   - short sellers must pay the stock dividend themselves if they hold, so they will all cover.   This doesn’t make sense because it gives companies a nuclear bomb to fuck shorts whenever they want to. This would be a common practice whenever companies want to bump their stock price, such as before c-suite stock compensation is due. Markets don’t give companies the option to force short sellers to buy shares or pay.|2022-07-07 05:27:48

The divorce was based on the fact that the fraudsters created a fake restaurant where men from Tinder were invited on a date.    Deceived people came to the establishment, where the girls were treated to food at inflated prices. For example, the cost of olive oil is about 1,000 hryvnias😁        The victims had to pay large bills from 5,000 to 20,000 hryvnias, thus they profited from the feelings of men. As the police found out, in fact the restaurant did not exist, and all the ego staff were actors. All participants of this "performance" face up to 12 years behind bars.|2022-07-07 09:35:48

Was that the death knell?   Or will you all buy for one more great run today to $160 or whatever before dumping it?     Come on, I need a win. ES has been pissing at me all week. Market goes down, I short, it launches a spike. I cover, it squats and takes a dump right in front of me.     What's up with that co. that sells CDs that nobody will ever patron again? You buying for one last moon shot or dumping because it's finally over?     Thank you|2022-07-07 07:37:28
