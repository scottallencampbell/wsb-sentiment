Retail investors step in and hike up cost.  GME is so volatile it threatens to go nuclear.  DTCC realizes they're gonna lose a bunch of money. Oh no.

nwt9j0|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|6|What are good alternatives to Fidelity? I switched from Robinhood. Their phone app is truly terrible. I liked that they didn't limit purchased on GME, AMC, etc. I had a question regarding the transfer from Robinhood and stayed in queue for over an hour for the online chat. Sometimes my number in the queue went up. I had heard that their customer service is great, but I wouldn't call that good customer service. I have heard good things about eTrade, but didn't they block trading on a lot of the "meme stocks" too? WeBull is owned by Alibaba, and I wouldn't trust them with my data or money.  Edit: I should note that I didn't stay in the line after an hour. I dropped from the queue when I was still about number 120.

nwvhou|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|5|Bets on PLTR? I bet that the lockup selling is priced in, and actually not many people will sell because it's fallen so hard anticipating a dump. I suspect we struggle at milestones like 30, 35, and 40 again because shareholders who want to sell will wait for a better price. All the chimps who panic sold shares 25-27 will start to panic buy when we start going up throughout next week. We might see a spike back over 30 but I don't think it will hold due to my point above.   I could be wrong and we could dump back to 18. Jacked to the tits on shares/calls though.|2021-02-18 12:20:30

You've testified you had a short interest in GME in the timeframe in question?  And what happens to the value of those short positions when the underlying goes up 2000+% in a couple weeks?  Mr. Robinhood what happens to the buying pressure during a short squeeze when brokers discontinue the ability for investors to buy the underlying?  So the testimony today Mr. Melvin and Mr. Robinhood is that you expect this committee to believe that brokers preventing the ability of investors to continue to buy the said stock was completely unrelated to a colluded effort to protect the grossly underwater short positions of institutional investors in that exact same timeframe?  and is instead a fluke liquidity issue based on volatility?

nvw5vm|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|8|Lmao all you palantards. How fucking seriously dumb are you? It‚Äôs an INVESTMENT. It‚Äôs not a TRADE. So if your whining about the price action you playing this ticker wrong. Buy n hold check back in 5 years. That‚Äôs it.   This company has existed for over 18 years and it‚Äôs STILL not consistently profitable. Nearly 2 decades in and they for the first time just finally generated 1b in sales.   Yet they are valued as the Tesla of their questionable business sector even though they aren‚Äôt doing anything disruptive or on the grand scale like Tesla is. Karp is not musk. Get fucking real palantards. There‚Äôs no justification for this trash being over 40b market cap when they have proven to do fuck all for many years in a row.   Thiel took em public for a reason. To dump on you morons and cash out. That is obviously short term noise and won‚Äôt matter in 5 years plus when it (if) successfully grows and matures|2021-02-18 08:00:30

Historically the large institutional investors have been right more than wrong.  Is it different this time around?  Does the "retail revolution" have the power to change this?

Catalysts: just released news today that their company has one of the only rapid saliva tests that picks up the coronavirus variants. They have a MDEL stamp for emergency use.   In talks with global partners for their rapid test, including major sports groups.    In talks also with the bigs at Dallas Fort Worth airport for use of their rapid test for travelers inbound and out.  They are talking of uplisting to Nasdaq.   Think a sona like run, but with healthy consolidation in between every new high, and stronger diamond hands. Also, SONA is a dumpster fire, which is facing lawsuits for lieing to their investors. EMPOWER, has transparency, and much much bigger things in store.   Do your DD, buy, and thank me later. ‚úå   Already a 10 banger. Soon to be a 20x.

As i understand for every share that is currently traded, 4 more will be available from today) because i couldnt sell at 39 after it was 44! I couldnt sell at 37, after it was 39 and so on.

nwcob7|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|3|  Alright, listen up smooth brains, it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to anyone but climate change is here. As we‚Äôre seeing with Texas, this won‚Äôt lead to just a firey hellscape resemblant of LA, but more dramatic cold seasons as well, which we are currently seeing with Texas. Almost as if the weather will be getting more VOLATILE.   A quick google search shows several companies, including Enron, paved the way for trading weather derivatives years ago. With the involvement of a player like that, I‚Äôve literally never felt more confident in an asset class. I‚Äôm proposing a real simple play, either straddle or strangle that line as hard as you can. Added bonus: a position totally separate from the financial markets, which should make all of you ‚Äúserious investment‚Äù nerds happy.   No positions yet as I am a retarded who still needs to figure out how to trade weather derivatives, can‚Äôt wait to lose all my money.|2021-02-18 10:11:26

nvr4o6|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|4|CCL - Why I like the stock:     We are in a period of COVID recovery. Second-round vaccines are being distributed. 40 mil Americans are vaccinated. And Carnival Cruiselines stated a few hours ago they are test running three ships re-opening in a COVID safe environment.     CCL is trading at a 60% discount from its pre-covid stock price just 9 months ago. No matter what, this stock will likely increase in value over time, simply because people will eventually vacation again. BUTTTTT the reason I LIKE THIS STOCK, is because a travel boom is expected in the upcoming summer or early 2022. Every day COVID results worldwide get better, CCL goes up.     This means that a 60% discount may actually be even more of an undervaluation than what is to be expected in a short period of time.     Insiders are divided. Several organizations rate it a buy, some a sell, a few hold. Perfect time to recognize a boom before insiders start pouring their money into the company.      SHORT TERM: If the ship tests go well, the stock goes up.     LONG TERM: If COVID gets better, the stock goes WAYYY up. As in more than doubles, likely triples in a short term pop as traveling increases when COVID restrictions lift.     Other rationales: It's cheap. The company has real value, so there is no unexpected floor to wash away your gains.      THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR OR ANALYST. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT CCL STOCK. THIS IS JUST THE RANTING OF A MAD MAN.|2021-02-18 07:11:04

No mind, no form, I only exist; Now ceased all will and thought; The final end of Nature's dance, I am it whom I have sought. A realm of Bliss bare, ultimate; Beyond both knower and known; A rest immense I enjoy at last; I face the One alone. I have crossed the secret ways of life, I have become the Goal. The Truth immutable is revealed; I am the way, the God Soul. My spirit aware of all the heights, I am mute in the core of the Sun. I barter nothing with time and deeds; My cosmic play is done.|2021-02-18 10:59:34

Not having a long history with these things, I ask the following:  Doesnt' this hurt the ability to merge with a company?  If the underlying asset is just worth $10/share, how does driving the price above $60 add value to a merger partner?   It would seem they're getting $50/share of "Air" for the $10 of value the IPO vehicle brings to the table?    What am I missing here?|2021-02-18 13:17:58

nwnrgo|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|1|I've been investing a long time. Longer than I will admit. Value is very important and should never be overlooked. I'm sure you've heard many say the equity markets are overpriced for the most part and with stocks like Tesla that haven't made a profit in the last four quarters, they're right. So how much is a stock really worth and how do you figure that out. Warren Buffet is famous for buying dividend-paying blue chips when they're cheap and holding them for long periods of time, through their up and down cycles. The value of a stock or any cash flow is called the net present value. It sort of what an investor is willing to pay for something that returns an X percent annually, where X is the average interest rate investors are currently receiving from their investments, some call the capitalization rate or CAP rate. Projected earnings is also a key means of determining the value of a company, however, those estimates can be really wrong so you surely don't want to hand your fortune on projected earning. There are other ways as well but I don't want to write an investor's guide I just want to get people to think about say what GME is really worth and the answer "what a person is willing to pay is not a very good one. Sometimes stupid people pay too much money for something and then lose their shirts.|2021-02-18 11:28:16

But here's why I-LIKE-THE-STOCK.  üöÄ The current price is using a previous downward trend line as support. üöÄ The price rose up to 22 in the last two trading sessions and I expect this to break this mark in the next five trading sessions. There's a gap on the daily between 21.79 and 23.80 and a break of 22 could push this to 25. I definitely see this happening in the next 15 days.  üöÄ The price broke out of a strong consolidation zone and a strong support of 15.5  üöÄ I see an incoming GOLDEN CROSS on the daily between 50EMA and 200EMA which means strongly bullish.

nwmog4|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|0|$GLBS is the easiest 500% play on the market right now ! Good afternoon Bulls . The objective is still the same , the path is still paved and the setup is still primed for an amazing run . The only change is who holds the shares and who will profit from them . Keep in the back of your mind that you could own shares of a company that now has $90,000,000 in cash on hand , in one of the hottest sectors of 2021 , a fleet composed of ships that demand the highest rates in over a decade , news soon to be dropped regarding multiple ship acquisitions , an ER that is going to blow the top off any ER this company has EVER seen , exercisable warrants at $18 and $35 (which both the institutions AND company want the stock price to pass so they can profit from them) and you get to buy it at a QUARTER OF ITS LIQUIDATION VALUE ! Are you kidding me ?! This is the best play on the market . That is why you have seen so many big players load up and wait these past few weeks . This is a literal goldmine . 600% increase in price from here is as close to a guarantee as you are going to get . If just getting over $10 is what you are focusing on ? Then you are in the wrong place with the wrong mindset and hands to weak to hold this . Do not sell yourself short . Do yourself the favor and hold on tight to your shares here so YOU are the one who benefits the most here . Good luck bulls I will see you at the top ! Cheers üçª|2021-02-18 11:21:20

While the Comcast Business network already serves thousands of residents and businesses in the area, this concentrated expansion deploys more than 2.5 miles of infrastructure in and near Chester's main business district, which has experienced a redevelopment boom in recent years. New and existing area businesses will now have access to advanced broadband services.  Significant work has already begun to provide high-performance internet, Ethernet, television, advanced voice and other solutions to many businesses and organizations, and additional network expansions will continue into the second quarter of 2021. With this latest project, Comcast Business has now invested more than $85 million in proactive network expansions in the region since 2014, including more than $30 million invested in the City of Philadelphia.|2021-02-18 08:57:30

nvrhr9|lmk8bq|lmk8bq|-21|It looks like the SLV (a major Silver ETF out of London) is in trouble. It announced the other day that its authorized agents "may" not be able to acquire the physical silver it is required to purchase because of limited supplies.  Apparently, some large long positions were bought and they could not find the physical bullion to buy. IMO, this could be seen ethically as a breach of the protection of shareholder's equity. If the fund can't provide a realistic market value of physical silver bullion, then it can't protect the shareholder's equity. The entire idea of buying silver right now is to hedge against inflation. If they can provide a true market value price for physical silver, then owning it defeats the purpose. As many of you probably already know, last year, there has been a separation in pricing with physical silver bullion prices $5 to $10 higher than futures prices on the COMEX and prices in the various ETFs. If you go out and try to buy physical "bullion" right now, you would probably have to pay in the $32 to $38 range, if you can even find it, whereas the Comex Spot price is just over $27. Speculation is they, both the Comex and major ETFs are not acquiring the necessary silver to meet the positions and it's squeezing the shorts and they are trying to protect them. Former traders at J.P. Morgan are currently being prosecuted for market manipulations of silver. My suggestions are too long Comex silver futures to continue squeezing the shorts and look into filing a class action suit against SLV.  Any ideas, critiques or alternative suggestions are surely desired.|2021-02-18 07:14:56
