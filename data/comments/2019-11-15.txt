If I close the current one and get a different spread for Dec, I can get away by paying only 2.5k or so and get more time. Or I can get a 303/306 spread and gain some credit while not losing too much additional money. Otherwise I take the full loss. Obviously can only do this once, I don't have a high personal risk tolerance :p  Any holes in the strategy?|2019-11-15 06:54:48

7kqaa0|dwp9pe|dwp9pe|3|Ross says phase 1 will get signed "in all likelihood." Can't even say what's in it. ATH cool cool cool cool cool cool.  What I find interesting is Ross brought up the issue of will China commit to $40-50 billion per year in ag purchases. This is probably one of Trump's core demands and it's not remotely realistic at that dollar amount, given their current demand for these products and that they've already shifted many agricultural supply lines to other countries. The Chinese don't even want to commit to 20 billion, they'd rather the document say we'll try our best to start buying stuff from the U.S. again without specifying a fairy tale dollar amount.  It does seem based on what Ross said that 1. Trump is not very open to phase 1 rollbacks so the best  you'd see is calling off the December ones. And 2. He expects China to cave on the 40-50 billion in soybeans.  So when Kudlow and Ross say that in all likelihood the phase 1 will be signed, what they're really saying is in all likelihood the Chinese will cave to Trump's pressure.|2019-11-15 06:54:05

I give them a 2-3+ hour window and they come an hour before like everytime. Even when I purposely set the time further back.

7kylk7|dwp9pe|dwp9pe|6|Guys I've been buying SPY puts for nearly 2 years now. 2018 was my most successful year, I went from being down 90% on a 10k investment in October 2018 to coming out of it with 16k (a $6k or 60% profit) in December.  I've come to basically the same situation I found myself in October of 2018. We're at ATH, the sentiment is mega bullish, the ALL tab on my RH account today says -$1k when I could've quit last year when I was $6k ahead, yet I continue to average down with all my savings on SPY 293p 12/31.
