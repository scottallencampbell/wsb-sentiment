"Meanwhile there was welcome news in terms of a    marked easing in upward price pressures, but it's clear    that price growth remains elevated despite coming off    recent peaks, all of which points to a bout of **stagflation**    in the near term."|2022-07-06 08:51:08

f3sph3|vsmc7v|vsmc7v|6|Hey you degenerates, here's your DD. Make sure to read the fed minutes, and keep in mind these excerpts from the last couple statements.  May fed statement: The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. **With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong.** In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to **3/4 to 1 percent** and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee decided to begin **reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities** on **June 1**, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in conjunction with this statement.   June statement: The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate **to 1‚Äë1/2 to 1-3/4 percent** and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee **will continue** reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. **The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.**|2022-07-06 13:19:56

f3sm7s|vsmc7v|vsmc7v|6|Markets have nearly fully priced in another 75 basis points rate hike in July with which the minutes align with. Investors are paying closer attention to discussions around the September rate decision, however.        See 50 or 75bps at the next meeting, July, as likely.    Even more restrictive policy is possible in time.    Fed's George was the only official not to back 75 basis points in June.    'Many' participants judged there was a 'significant risk' higher inflation could become entrenched if the public questions Fed's resolve.    Participants 'concurred' that high inflation warranted 'restrictive' interest rates, with the possibility of a 'more restrictive stance' if inflation persists.    The Fed expects inflation to remain above 2% for some time.     https://www.fxstreet.com/news/fomc-minutes-even-more-restrictive-policy-is-possible-in-time-202207061803|2022-07-06 13:19:19

f3kyrt|vsmc7v|vsmc7v|10|Unlike the **QQQ** (Nasdaq), **IWM** (Russell) or **DIA** (Dow Jones), the **SPY** (S&P500) ETF has a very important requirement:  To join the S&P500 the company needs to be **profitable for 4 consecutive quarters**!   **$SPY** was engineered to constantly **go up** unlike all other ETFs in the sector that only have market cap requirements. Unprofitable companies are delisted very quickly.   In 1970's companies remained in S&P500 on average for 30 years by 1990s it was down to 20 years and now its closer to 10 years on average.   Over the past decade, **50%** of the S&P 500 has been replaced. If the trend continues, approximately **75%** of companies on the index will be replaced by 2027. Unprofitable companies are delisted fast and are replaced with good profitable companies that work in the current economy!

f3g1c1|vsmc7v|vsmc7v|7|^^^Sponsored ^^^by ^^^secretary ^^^Janet ^^^Yellen  **Series I** bonds are paying almost **10%** right now. That's pretty much S&P average yearly returns since 1993. You can buy them directly from the government website, max $10,000 per year in digital bonds plus $5,000 in paper bonds when you do your taxes by filing form 8888 and using your refund. What happens if you don't usually get $5,000 back from IRS every year? You can use this little trick. You can "overpay" your quarterly taxes by $5,000 and at the end of the year when you get that money back you can use it to buy these savings bonds. You can also buy these as gifts for your family or friends with absolutely no risk for them.   https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm  Are you really confident you can return 10% a year in a coming bear market?  You know you gonna gamble that $10k on options anyway, why not get a guaranteed return?   Get Series I bonds today.   ^^^Sponsored ^^^by ^^^secretary ^^^Janet ^^^Yellen|2022-07-06 11:55:02

f309u3|vsmc7v|vsmc7v|6|The next big Audiophile hipster fad is going to be CDs. Its better than Vinyl, cheaper than Vinyl, has high volumes of cheap used CDs lying around, and high end 90s-00s Players are available on the used market for cheap. Its also quality wise better than Streaming since unless you have the hyper specific situation of having an expensive high end DAC that can connect to your phone, you are capped at 1/4 the data rate of CDs.  Clearly the smart move is to get in on the ground floor and start picking up high end CDs and CD players off the used market, and holding them until insufferable hipsters find out the only new CD players being made are 300$+ audiophile players. Then flipping these 30$-50$ players for like 150$ each.  Its better returns than Crypto or the stock market, but you have the addes bonus that your collateral investment is something you can actually use and enjoy.  Don't be the poor sap FOMOing in 3 years later paying 12$ per used CD.|2022-07-06 10:13:07

f2talj|vsmc7v|vsmc7v|1|The ISM Services PMI edged lower to 55.3 in June of 2022 from 55.9 in May, but continued to point to strong growth for the services sector, beating market forecast of 54.3. The slight slowdown was due to softer new orders (55.6 vs 57.6) and a fall in employment (47.4 vs 50.2) while business activity rose faster (56.1 vs 54.4) and price pressures eased for a second month (80.1 vs 82.1). At the same time inventories contracted for the first time since January 2022 (47.5 vs 51). Still, the outlook remains challenging as "logistical challenges, a restricted labor pool, material shortages, inflation, the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine continue to negatively impact the services sector‚Äù, according to Anthony Nieves, Chair of the ISM Services Business Survey Committee. The Inventory Sentiment Index (46.2 vs 44.5) contracted in June for the fourth consecutive month, indicating that inventories are in ‚Äòtoo low‚Äô territory and insufficient for current business requirements.|2022-07-06 09:25:35

f3oybp|vsmc7v|vsmc7v|1|Opinion, not advice. I think oil going flat for the last 3 weeks was anticipating the possibility of demand destruction. It‚Äôs at an inflection point, where consumer demand for oil isn‚Äôt priced in, rather an unknown. We know supply ain‚Äôt getting better anytime soon, demand will eventually fall, but I think that is a timeframe further into the recession. Which is why buffet went long OXY. There‚Äôs still another massive pump from limited supply and demand not dropping as fast as possible. This theory breaks if demand craters, but crater is emphasized because it has to happen fast for oil prices to really significantly change. War in Ukraine will become the next Afghanistan, billions will be spent and no true resolution will happen. Russian oil is fully off the table soon, and JPM idea of 360 a barrel is maybe only off by a hundred bucks or so üëÄ pure theory|2022-07-06 12:54:22
