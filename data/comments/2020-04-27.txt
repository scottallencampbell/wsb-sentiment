oqbhtc|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|11|Think $BA's current price is based on them being seen as primarily an airplane manufacturer?  Initial selloff was driven by lack of commercial airplane sale prospects for the next year and the pandemic scare. Could have been a major over-sell.  Over the last decade, BA has reduced commercial airplane sales from 75% to \~40% of its revenue, with significantly more diversification in other sectors. Earnings call has a chance of reminding people of their diversification, and having a stronger position than expected.  They're going to get government bailout money for the airplane sector, and continued government cheese for their defense and aerospace contracts.  Boeing Global Services maintains, upgrades, and keeps old airplanes in service all over the world - which will be in high demand as Airlines seek to maintain their old fleets and defer new plane sales until there is more certainty around travel.

Maybe i'm just not a poultry guy but I don't see the honest appeal here. That said the quality was better than that of a McDonald's biscuit so I won't knock it too hard.   It is unfortunate Wendy's launched their new menu during the pandemic but if they can hold out I can see them winning some market share in the breakfast space.

orejfn|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|15|My opinion on todays market movement:     Last two weeks investors have moved into tech as a "safe space", which is reflected in its gains obviously over the last couple weeks. Sunday, Cuomo announced that NYC hospitalizations have been steadily decreasing over the last 14 days and virus deaths hit a one-month low. The greatest outbreak center in the US is slowing down and investors see this. This signals to investors that the virus-curve is flattening and we are on our way to recovery. So in the short term (1-2 months) we will be fine. What remains to be seen are the long term effects the shutdown will have on the economy and business.     Today, you are seeing investors be more optimistic about the market in the short term w/ a near-term recovery (V-shaped) and are moving money back from Tech into the more traditional sectors which explains why tech is down today but SPY is up bigly. If techs earnings are within the pessimistic expectations of wall street, we will keep mooning.     TLDR: If you are a bear, you better be fucking hedged.|2020-04-27 13:08:03

oqoqf4|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|3|USO DO THAT DANCE AGAIN WE LOVED LAST WEEK  USO: United States Oil Fund LP USO, the biggest exchange-traded fund with oil exposure, said Monday that it would further reduce its holdings of oil futures contracts in specific months. USO's valuation has plummeted along with the price of oil CL in recent weeks, and regulators also believe its dominance in the market for these futures has skewed pricing. The fund will now have approximately 30% of its holdings in the July futures contracts, and approximately 15% of its holdings in each of the August, September, October, and December contracts, skipping November. USO will shift about one-third of its positions to the holdings noted above on April 27, 28, and 29. The fund's moves come as West Texas Intermediate for June delivery CLM20 was trading down 28% early Monday. USO is down 15% on Monday, and has lost more than 83% in the year to date.|2020-04-27 09:33:28

orirpy|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|3|Although there hasn‚Äôt been a complete cleanse yet, the question is will the government save it again like 08 or will we allow it to happen naturally and become a better system   So far we have JC Penney file Bankruptcy (no brainer there; it should‚Äôve gone under years ago), Neiman Marcus, and today diamondback energy, just US market examples...  So we have those examples all impacted from direct hits aka retail sector (no one is outside shopping) and diamond back is a structurally poor company hit hard from low crude prices  The question is: who will die through an indirect impact? If we see that, it‚Äôll change the whole view. However, we have the fed who has acted accordingly--and fair enough it‚Äôs their job. They don‚Äôt look out for the US speculators, but more for ppl's 401Ks etc..  Now let‚Äôs say the fed bails companies out again...We will end up in a low growth low inflation environment like japan, and we will probably hit GDP growth of 1.5% until a new asset bubble occurs. If that happens in say 5-6 years, it‚Äôll be detrimental and the tools the fed used this time around will not work again think ECB etc.  So will we see a cleanse? Idk, it‚Äôs up to the government, but do I think it‚Äôll happen.|2020-04-27 13:42:15

oqnlp0|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|2|Question about ITM bull call spreads. If the difference between the prices is less than the difference between the strikes and the calls are deep ITM, is that just easy, low risk profit?  Specifically weekly AAPL 265c is 28.95 and AAPL 260c is 24.25. So the net you spend is 4.7 but as long as AAPL stays above 265, which seems pretty obvious, this feels like a free .3 or 6%.

orrkwn|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|3|#Sirius XM earnings report before open tomorrow.  They fell around 35% during the drop and have only recovered around 15% of that so far.  They do 3 mo, 6 mo, and 12 mo contracts for locking in prices (though you can cancel at any time). Most of their users are never going to go cancel until their billing period is up, I know I wouldnt even think about it being active until then.  Normally I can talk the salesperson into giving me a cheaper price on renewal because they have 0 overheard for new listeners, its all sales based. The past 3 years Ive been able to easily get a discount in order to keep me signed on, they were giving up to like 50% discounts to keep me around when I would threaten to cancel.  However this past time, and this was before the virus, they wouldnt give me any discount at all no matter what tactic I tried. For a company who's overhead is set whether you have 1 listener or 100 million, this seems very bullish to me. They know they have a product people will pay for.  Sirius was also early on offering free streaming until the middle of May for anyone. They know people are locked at home and they are trying to acquire as many listeners as possible.  Their current subscribers wont cancel to take advantage of this, so I imagine they will boast lots of user growth.  Not that far OTM options are cheap as well currently, seems like the upside is pretty big.|2020-04-27 14:54:37

The public portion of their company is about 1/7 of their valuation. What is 1/7 of $3.3b? That's what their market cap should be. Since you're probably too stupid to think to do that, I'll do the calc for you. Their market cap should be no higher than $480 million. That means their shares should be no higher than $10   Keep in mind their valuation is counting on gambling becoming legal in several states and their revenue share dominating there. If you want to play them long-term... Fine. But 2020 revenue is going to be shit, they're valued at 15 years of revenue growing faster than it's grown yet.

oqzhwz|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|2|Am I the only one super skeptical about this whole tanker pump?  To a layman it makes sense on paper but I don't see how overabundance of domestic oil translates to increased tanker revenue unless ports are literally turning shipments away, though im pretty sure that oil is already sold and bound in a contract before it leaves the middle east.  Unless the glut is an opprotunity for tanker companies to put more ships into the game, which sure makes sense for a second but I also can't really imagine these companies have spare tankers sitting around when those are literally their means of revenue.|2020-04-27 11:05:50

Ask yourself this question, if a company was going bankrupt and their shares were $100 a piece, and then JPow comes around and says he will not let it fall below $100, are you going to ignore the bankruptcy and load up or not?   When the fed is backstopping everything, it doesn't matter what you are buying, it could be literal dog shit but as long as someone else (the fed) will pay top dollar for it, you buy that dog shit and make some money.|2020-04-27 14:35:02

orwblf|g8y4jt|g8y4jt|1|what % of a theta value decays in between options trading periods?  e.g. at 9:30 my TSLA c's had a -5.53 theta value. so the most accurate way to think of that is that the option will decay that much in the next 24 hour window. i know it's a somewhat exponential curve on the scale of days, but what about hours?  so 4:00PM today to 9:30AM tomorrow is 17.5 hrs. does a proportionate amount of theta decay in that period? so 17.5/24 = 73%  73% of -5.53 = -4.04 so if IV and intrinsic value stayed the same (share price stayed the same), would my option lose 4.04?|2020-04-27 15:34:04

Right now, the economic news is really bad.  Yet, as expected, stocks keep going up.  The question is WHEN will the market react to the economic news.

In other words, if we keep the economy shut down, right where it is, it seems that the pandemic won't get worse. That is not at all the same as saying things are getting better. We have no evidence the virus is going away, or that we're becoming immune. Which means that sending people back to work again - restarting the economy - may simply re-fuel the pandemic. Optimism will be justified when the President announces a detailed plan for how we will uniformly test for the virus, trace and quarantine all carriers, and execute a contain and control plan that allows local work to restart, with a statewide and then regional rollout. But based on the last 4 months of shoot-from the lip incompetence, don't expect any such planning from this Administration.|2020-04-27 10:39:26
