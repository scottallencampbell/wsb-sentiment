357dz2|ii4hau|ii4hau|6|"Theta Gang" (if I can call myself that anymore) checking in, and checking out from the market early today.  Wednesday saw 4 massive earnings blowouts (DKS, CRM, PLAN and URBN) that ended up costing 40% of my account value in one day, and over a month's worth of gains were lost.   On tilt, I bought a TSLA FD yesterday to see if I could scalp a quick profit, watched it immediately drop into "diamond hands" territory, held it until today and managed to sell it for a small (but incredibly stressful) profit. Ironically, buying that option blew out my buying power for the day, or I would have short-strangled ULTA and gotten my ass handed to me yet again this morning.  I also dabbled in a few other longs: SLV 26c, HPE 9p and TNA 9/4 36. None of that shit is working out. The TSLA 2300c FD made a profit simply because I saw it went green and took my money back; if I held ten minutes more, I would have taken a loss.    I don't know what it is, but every long position I have ever taken since I started dabbling in 2005 has turned to shit. This serves as yet another a reminder to stick with what works for me, even when I have to take a big fat L.  I am become Theta, destroyer of profits.  Ending the week, I am down 22% of my account value. It puts me at 60% up for the year, and a little over 100% since abandoning bear ways in April.  I need a drink.|2020-08-28 10:42:05

I put 4k in the bank and proceeded to lose most of the 9k I had left buying puts in a market that i didnt understand why didnt circuit break everyday anymore. But I got smart (or more autistic?) and as of today have turned that same house money back into 12k. I have it all in buying power as of now. How much would you send back to the bank?|2020-08-28 12:32:06

34k5pe|ii4hau|ii4hau|17|While washing dishes, you faintly hear the baseball game on the TV in the other room get interrupted by the local news broadcast team. *Must be another report on the hurricane.*  You dry your hands and walk into the living room just in time to hear the anchor say, “We’re going live now.” The screen blackens for a split second, then cuts into a shot of a brightly lit, white room. There’s nothing in the room except two men and a chair. Sitting in the chair is...Steve Jobs. You rub your eyes. Lounging at Jobs’ feet is Tim Cook, who nuzzles against Jobs’ shin like a hungry cat. You rub your eyes again, but when you open them, the spectacles and black turtleneck and dad jeans and every ounce of Steve Jobs is still in the chair. Suddenly, he speaks:  “Resurrection. A small, but essential part of the Buddhist tradition. Bodhidharma was poisoned six times by jealous monks who envied his wisdom and teaching prowess. By the time of their sixth attempt, Bodhidharma had already completed his missionary activities, and transmitted the Dharma to a successor.” Jobs shortly pauses to play lightly with Cooks hair, then looks at the camera again. “Therefore he made no further effort to rescue himself and died. He was buried at Mount Xiong'er, in a stupa erected at Dinglin temple.”  Jobs stands and walks closer to the camera, until his face fills the screen. “Years later, one of Bodhidharma’s former students stumbled upon his old Master, alive and well. Shocked, the student begged his Master for an explanation, but Bodhidharma would not give one to a lesser, fragile mind.”  Another pause. “Just as I will not give one. Simply know this. I have the power of resurrection. Apple has the power of resurrection. The secret is proprietary and for us to use as we see fit.” Jobs then laughs, and it’s an awkward sound—not simply because he lost practice while dead, but also because he never practiced much while living. “At the conclusion of this broadcast, we are gifting the world a live Tupac concert. The stream will only be available on Apple TV.”  He then steps back from the camera and sits back in the chair. “Oh, and one last thing.” Cook looks up at the camera and smiles at Job’s voice. “I remember well those who poisoned me. Tomorrow, it will be announced we are acquiring TikTok.”|2020-08-28 07:08:19

35jbyn|ii4hau|ii4hau|3|> Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) claims its attempts to inform users that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) would take a 30% cut from its new online events feature was thwarted by the latter, Reuters reported Thursday.  > What Happened: The Mark Zuckerberg-led social media platform was forced to remove a message that informed users of Apple’s cut in order to get its events tool aimed at helping small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to users, according to Reuters.  > Apple allegedly referred to its App Store rules that prohibit developers from displaying “irrelevant” information, the social platform claimed.   > “Unfortunately Apple rejected our transparency notice around their 30% tax but we are still working to make that information available inside the app experience,” Facebook told Reuters.  > A similar message due to appear on Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Play Store reportedly doesn't show up on that marketplace either.  > Why It Matters: Last week, the social media giant voiced criticism over what it referred to as the “App Store Tax” on its initiative to support small businesses through online events.  > The platform wanted Apple to reduce its 30% commission or alternatively let users use Facebook Pay.  > The Menlo Park, California-based company is also facing challenges related to advertising revenue, which it says would be significantly affected by changes the iPhone maker has made to its iOS 14 operating system.  > Epic Games Inc sued Apple this month after its “Fortnite” game was removed from the App Store as it tried to circumvent the 30% cut by introducing alternative payment systems for in-game purchases.  > Price Action: Facebook shares closed nearly 3.5% lower at $293.22 on Thursday and fell another 0.3% in the after-hours session.

The constant fears and hesitations you cause are worse than nails on a chalkboard.**  **It is only when I put in the hours doing the work you tell me not to do that you hide for a while.**  **Your ugly side is absolutely disgusting as you reach deep into your arsenal to give out headaches, illness, and stress. You love to make engines stall and tires go flat.**   **I know in this never-ending war I will lose some battles. Since you attack first from within, you have many advantages. You maybe beat me tomorrow, but I will prevail today. Every word on the page is a chink in your armor. Every sentence is a jab to your gut. I am a writer. I am creative. September I’m ready to fight. Next week I’m ready to fight.**   A bear.|2020-08-28 11:05:09

35f7ug|ii4hau|ii4hau|3|nothing to do with trading but my try hard adjunct professor locked us out of the discussion, after he locked the syllabus behind a cipher. The syllabus is scrambled text, i am pretty sure its a cipher. i only have 3 clues,   1: the ciphered syllabus  2: " As one looks into the mirror,   Time moves swift,   What once was youthful aging,   Has one later rot and wilt. "  3:  "What comes next in the sequence.... 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, ...?" (even my dumb ass knows its 47)  the next step is to enter a pass code to proceed. I assume that pass code is in the cipher.    any ideas? im trying to get this shit done so i can spend my weekend waiting tables to fuel my gambling addiction|2020-08-28 11:44:27

34hkpl|ii4hau|ii4hau|4|Part of me thinks Powell’s comments were carefully timed to be right before the market open in an attempt to pump them before donnys big speech last night but didn’t work. Also was really suspicious that futures started mooning in the middle of his speech. Probably just a coincidence but then again why move the comments up randomly on the schedule? In any case price action showed yesterday that Fed is pretty much powerless now to further pump this market given where it is. I was reading a well respected charlatan yesterday who was calling this a new bull market that will run for years and comparing it to when tepper called the bottom in 2010 lmao. Yeah so similar except that I don’t think S&P and Nasdaq were at ATHs then with multiple mega cap companies having 2-3x’d over the last 12 months. How people so dumb?|2020-08-28 06:34:20

369tva|ii4hau|ii4hau|4|If you are a US citizen, you are $80,278 in debt.  $26,500,000,000,000  / 330,100,000  At 2.492% average interest rate you pay $2000 a year in interest on your debt (which we are not paying any principal back on). That'S 3.4% of the median, $59,039 US salary.  However, the $59k median salary is for a family, not an individual. The average family size in the US is 3.19 persons, or is $252k in debt, which owes $6,282 in annual interest. This is 12.6% of the median family salary.   Trump lowered tax on a family of 3-4 at the 50k level about $100-$500.\* But he's added 30% to the national debt, or $1450 in annual interest per family.  THIS IS JUST TO PAY FOR WHAT WE BORROWED FROM THE FUTURE WITHOUT RISKING RAISING "TAXES" TO PAY FOR IT NOW. This money has showed up disproportionately in the stokc market as retail investors, last year 15% of the market, but now 25%+, are piling in to a dangerous game of musical chairs, one that has, among other less high flying stocks, sent TSLA from $185 in May of 2019 to nearly $2300 today, up some 1100% in 15 and half months.  &#x200B;  \* Note that in some places, especially  "blue states," the reduction and/or elimination of *ad valorem* tax deductions actually increased tax for families at, or near, the median salary, so this $100-500 was not across the board.|2020-08-28 15:44:41

35vjd4|ii4hau|ii4hau|1|Retard question because I got into a situation I don't understand. Got a NVDA $450/455 expiry 10/16 bull call spread. NVDA dividend date is Sept 1st. I got an email from Robinhood warning me about dividend assignment risk.  I'm not actually facing any risk though right? The bid for the spreads are around $3.00 because there's so much time until expiry, so the potential value exceeds what they'd make from exercising to get the dividend. It's really unlikely anyone would exercise the short call, right?   And worst case scenario I get assigned, Robinhood will exercise my long call and I'll get the max value of the spread then pay the dividend amount?|2020-08-28 13:52:32

For the last 50 years, if there's going to be a party swap, stonks fall on September.  In 2016, 80% of the polls predicted a Dem victory but failed, now 99% of the polls say Biden will win. There's a stronger consensus, and after all, Trump lost the popular vote last time.  I'd say on the one hand Trump should win because of the riots and Biden being senile. On the other hand, Trump should lose because he's a clown.  Thoughts?|2020-08-28 10:34:41

Monday will probably be flat green open with a bleed to 350 before rocketing to 351 after closing today somewhere around 348.15.  &#x200B;  Reasoning: Everyone and their mother has puts today. Even the bulls. Bulls are also super long on 349/350/351 on the day and monday. They're getting bled out as well. VIX is up 10-15% on the week so everyone is buying super expensive insurance.   &#x200B;  I know I know, if the Vix is up, then a "move is coming" or some shit. But not. That is true when the VIX is cucking, not bleeding up day over day. If stocks take stairs up, the VIX uses a grappling hook.   &#x200B;  My theory on the trade: Errrrybody getting cucked. By EOD, both ATM calls and puts will be worthless. Then at some point the Vix will begin to die, crushing the value of your puts and your calls. Even on Monday if we open lower still or begin to get to 350/351- the VIX will be down enough and SPY will have been flat enough overall to screw you.   &#x200B;  Day trades today, weekend goes to theta, and then buy positions on Monday unless they're long dated.|2020-08-28 09:18:31

358mey|ii4hau|ii4hau|0|Back when NVDA was $420 I bought $450/455 debit spreads for October. Those shits are so goddamn far itm and they're still only 50% max value because I way fucking overestimated how long it'd take for them to hit. Just got thousands of dollars locked up for another month waiting for them to get closer to expiration while everything else moons. Not the worst problem to have, but it's no fun watching everyone else have a good time.  tl;dr - fuck spreads. FDs from now on.|2020-08-28 10:51:59
359obv|ii4hau|ii4hau|0|I think we’re looking too much into Vix. Put/call ratio has been at an all time low so obviously logic would tell us it has to go back to yearly averages. That just means more people buying puts, which causes Vix to go up.  But it doesn’t necessarily mean a crash is coming or whatnot, it’s simply just reverting back to the norms.|2020-08-28 11:00:23

35lx5u|ii4hau|ii4hau|-7|Hello friends.   Ok my third day trading as a Robinhood investor has not gone as well as I had hoped. I bought $500 worth on Wednesday morning and had worked my way up to $550 but alas I have lost three BigMacs today and am down to $538. I will not let a red day break my confidence that I can do this! We need the red days to help us appreciate the green ones even more. I hope that maybe we can hold through the split at $2,200+ but I am wondering if hoping for a third green day was asking too much. Still up...heck, it just keeps dropping doesn’t it? Still up 7.5% in total which is still really cool.   All the best,   -Zak from South Dakota.|2020-08-28 12:36:41

34dthn|ii4hau|ii4hau|-13|THIS IS A WARNING TO BULLS  The stock market right now is at an all-time-high despite the dire economic conditions. The US economy contracted by 33% in the 2nd quarter and unemployment is over 10%, yet somehow the stock market keeps shooting up. This is a result of the Fed pumping money into the market, buying corporate bonds, and setting interest rates near zero. The result will be inflation which hurts lower and middle class Americans while benefiting the rich even more.  Meanwhile the virus is nowhere near under control. There are studies showing that seasonality has a huge effect on its spread and death rate, yet the media is surprisingly silent on what likely awaits us in fall. Instead mainstream financial news outlets are telling their viewers not to worry, the market is going to keep surging into 2021, just keep buying even though it's obvious the market right now is in one of the biggest bubbles of all time. The elites created the financial conditions to herd people into the stock market rather than bonds or savings accounts, like sheep ready for slaughter.  For months the Democrats and media have been blaming Trump for the spread of the virus, as if the blame lies on him and not the country from where it originated. The nefarious plot is clear. Once it becomes evident in fall that cases and deaths are surging again real panic will spread through the market. The big players will do what they can to trigger a massive sell-off, and the Fed may also aid them in making bonds more attractive than equities. The result will be a market crash not seen since the Dot-com bubble in 2000. The elites in the know will become richer and the middle class will lose much of their savings. The Democrats will place the blame on Trump for not enforcing harsh enough lockdowns this year in order to secure a Biden victory, who has already promised that he will shut down the country again if the scientists recommend it.  TLDR: If you're still in the stock market, GTFO now and watch it soon burn.|2020-08-28 05:37:13

366cx8|ii4hau|ii4hau|-1|Jerome is saving the US with his 0% interest rate policy, average inflation policy, and digital money printing. It will make servicing the national debt much easier. When accounting for inflation, the REAL interest rate is actually negative so it is beneficial for the government to borrow. Even though you would get 0.75% on a 10Y T-bill, a 2% inflation makes that dollar you get back worth even less at the end of the day, and you would have lost 1.5% in purchasing power. This shit can't go tits up, because only the poor suffer (they can't afford to borrow or bad credit) while everyone else can borrow and inflate their debts away. And you can always declare bankruptcy, change your identity, and start all over.|2020-08-28 15:16:33
