Valuation (forward and trailing) multiples are about to be through the roof when they were high prior to the drop. Tech is about where it was prior to the drop, some even higher. For most of these companies, their financials are fundamentally worse. I’m generalizing, but the market still seems fundamentally broken. Next ER could be the next leg down as the reality of the situation for many companies becomes apparent to investors, then the algos will follow the larger sell orders, maybe.  JPOW also turned down the brrrrr, so stocks can’t just keep pumping due to inflation.   With that weak ass DD, I have decided to inverse myself and will stay long. Can’t go tits up.

noqe5n|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|8|Today is a very important day because the APR17 monthlies expire... and there is a LOT of OI. I suspect that the MM will try to suppress the market in order to expire the monthlies. Max pain for SPY is 277 and SPX is 2800. The market would have been flat if no news, but it can still close higher on this meaningful news. APR17 straddle was priced at about 4.65 yesterday, so ideally the MM want the straddle to expire. You can see that option sellers are trying to keep the market below 285.00. On expiration day, this is called [pinning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinningthestrike.asp). If the straddle was 4.65 and SPY is up 5.70 right now their loss is minimal. This is a major reason why that +10.00 spike from last night didn't hold (combined with the shadiness of the news).|2020-04-17 08:51:20

And there is massive, market moving hysteria that a cure has been found, just like the hydrochloroquine trial.     >Preliminary results were promising; it was used in the emergency setting during the [Kivu Ebola epidemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu_Ebola_epidemic) that started in 2018, along with further clinical trials, until August 2019, when Congolese health officials announced that it was significantly less effective than [monoclonal antibody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody) treatments such as [mAb114](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAb114) and [REGN-EB3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/REGN-EB3). The trials, however, established its safety profile.        It wasn't even effective for what it was originally designed for (Ebola).

Six weeks later, the trade truce was signed between US and China with an out clause, a very clever out clause:  "In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other." [Trade truce deal, article 7.6](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf)  China no longer needs to buy $200BNs of American goods.

nqabi9|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|7|Anecdotally, my company of ~200 people laid off 25 a couple weeks ago. They got a $1.3m PPP Loan two days ago and are only hiring back 4 workers and increasing 10 workers back to full pay who had it reduced.   If this is a common theme, which I think it will be, unemployment is going to keep going up and remain high for far longer than a lot of people want to believe.   Many companies will likely see that while not ideal, they’re able to get by with fewer employees and they aren’t going to rush back into hiring everyone back when there is massive uncertainty about what the economy is going to look like in 6 months.   If you’re justifying this rally based on some notion that markets are discounting a fast V shaped economic rebound, know that that’s probably BS.

Markets have soared on bad news and lead to a meme around here that buying calls on bad news = profit.   The markets will tank back down just as illogically and buying puts on good news will = profit.

npo4c1|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|6|Imagine this:   Powell colluding with China, selling them freshly ~~printed~~ written calls, telling them it will go up and manipulating the market to keep his promises. For a whole lot of time this works perfectly fine for every party involved. The calls are ITM, expiring monday, and China isn't exercising them yet because Powell tells them to hold for the big bounce coming over the weekend (China has now enough of these FED calls to buy a substantial amount of the s&p500) They accumulate those calls, buying more & more and they go up &up & up. This happened for the last 3 weeks.    But Powell ain't no bitch. He scammed china. Over the weekend (yes, this one) he publicly stops all monetary support to the markets, bringing them down and making all Chinese puts go OTM, expiring worthless.    Now Powell has collected mad tendies from china from selling the calls that expired worthless. And bears got a huge red day. Powell then (a few days later) writes every american a huge, fat check. With the money he robinhood'ed from the communist party of evil gyna. He of course gets removed as a FED chair for what he did, but he's popular in the USA anyway. Also, Trump pardons him of any crimes the SEC prosecutes him for. He runs for president 2020 where everyone still remembers how Powell helped prop up the economy, steal from the evil commies and qrite every american a check (trump feels betrayed but has no chance to win). Everyone likes this. Americas social democrats liked the UBI-kind of vibe, the conservatives liked that he screwed china, the financial elite liked that he saved the stonks. He wins a landslide victory and is president.    The end.|2020-04-17 13:42:04

We close flat IMO. Everyone keeps throwing around Bull traps on any rally. THIS is a bull trap. Futures are slowly bleeding, at apex last night we sat at +900. Be smart. P/E should mean something. Just because a stock has a lot of buyers and not sellers and the price goes up, does NOT mean that is what the company should be valued at. Why do you think buffet is sitting on the sidelines with all this cash he raised? He will see earnings and then once we get back below 2,200 S&P and things are reasonable.

Of course that's super retarded, but betting against it has financially fucked me in the ass. It's the gayest thing in the world, but you have to be that homosexual to make money on it. Turns out Bulls are the gayest ones after all.|2020-04-17 11:56:59

nolx28|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|3|The problem with oil  is storage capacity, its reaching the available maximum. You can't just close the tap on an oil well, you have to shut it in. In contradiction to Saudi etc where you can just drill a hole in the ground and it starts flowing, US requires advanced oil recovery techniques (inserting steam, water or chemicals) to get it out. Shutting in these wells is much more difficult and quite costly to get them going again at a later stage.  Giving the oil away for free can make more sense financially than shutting down oil fields...|2020-04-17 08:03:15

Chinese officials have repeatedly defended the accuracy of their data.  >The adjustment in the  Wuhan  figure pushed the death toll in  China  to 4,632.  >Wuhan  officials said they arrived at the new figure by double-checking data from medical facilities, crematoriums and testing records dating back to late March, and by revisiting records from prisons and nursing homes.  >Authorities also increased the number of confirmed cases in  Wuhan  by 325 to 50,333 after the review, the notice said.|2020-04-17 12:09:55

npwufh|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|4|*In a December 2006 interview, Cramer described activities used by hedge fund managers to manipulate stock prices—some of debatable legality and others illegal. He described how he could push stocks higher or lower with as little as $5 million in capital when he was running his hedge fund. Cramer said, "A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... When I was positioned short—meaning I needed it down—I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures." He also encouraged hedge funds to engage in this type of activity because it is "a very quick way to make money."[33] Cramer stated that everything he did was legal, but that illegal activity is common in the hedge fund industry as well. He also stated that some hedge fund managers spread false rumors to drive a stock down: "What's important when you are in that hedge-fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction."[34] Cramer described a variety of tactics that hedge fund managers use to affect a stock's price. Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as "the Pisanis of the world," in reference to CNBC correspondent Bob Pisani, who Cramer insinuated was able to be manipulated, saying "You have to use these guys." He also discussed giving information to "the bozo reporter from The Wall Street Journal" to get an article published.[35][36] Cramer said this practice, although illegal, is easy to do "because the SEC doesn't understand it."[37] During the interview Cramer referred to himself as a "banking-class hero."[38]*  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer  Why is this guy giving advice on stocks again? For all we know he's trying to manipulate the market right now.|2020-04-17 14:57:31

Yesterday, it said I still had 3 left, which I thought was odd, but I still used two like Monday. Today, it AGAIN reset to 3 day trades left. This effectively gives me 6 day trades to use in a week. I've been using it for months and have never had this happen before. I don’t have 25k balance, so I'm really confused. Has this happened to anyone else?|2020-04-17 08:56:59

The sharp  drop in the LEI reflects the sudden halting in business activity as a  result of the global pandemic and suggests the US economy will be facing  a very deep contraction.”|2020-04-17 09:32:51

This morning I was planning to eat my 50% loss on puts I bought a few days ago and turn them into calls.  Not because I think the market will go up, but because I just believe I should bet the opposite of my gut.  The reality is, if I did it, the markets will tank.

Edit: play is 5/1 strangle (earnings on 4/29) Edit2: they also haven't announced if they're taking a bailout, which should happen earnings and it'll be extra volatile.

It's the most important question for you to answer and the one question that matters most:       Why should I care?  It may come as shock, but your customers don't care about your product, service, company, or idea. They care about themselves--their hopes, dreams, and quality of life.

np6ewn|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|2|Here is why buying puts on any company in this environment is not recommended:  1. Historically, recoveries happen long before the economic consequences are fully felt. Markets are not a barometer for the economy, they are a future economic barometer, but how long into the future it projects is variable. 2. A virus is a temporary concern by nature. Even if you believe that the world economy will be shaken by this, it doesn't matter much to the markets if the markets knows the effects are temporary, i.e less than a year. 3. If you know something about the world economy, chances are every hedge fund manager knows as well. I.e it's priced in. The only time you should short is if you have information you think other people aren't paying attention to. For example, in February there were a fair bit of people who started shorting the market because they noticed people on Wall Street weren't paying attention to China. 4. Shorting in general is a much harder way to make money. Historically, every virus the world has ever endured has seen a full recovery less than 2 years later.|2020-04-17 11:13:41

It's just a crap shoot for singular events now a days. 5 years ago a positive phase trial result meant your stock was up 50% that day. Not anymore as much.|2020-04-17 09:03:28

np1hoa|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|1|**Long Puts (Jan 2021 timeframe):**  * $UBER: Demand for Uber rides (their only profitable business) is zero. Demand for UberEats has exploded - but they lose over $3 for every food order placed, meaning they are hemorrhaging money at an absurd rate. More on this [here.](https://qz.com/1693843/uber-eats-will-lose-money-until-at-least-2024-say-cowen-analysts/) * $XLE: Brent is going to $10 a barrel IMO. Saudis and Russia are already discussing re-opening talks, which is a symptom, not a solution. A handful of companies that comprise $XLE will go bankrupt over the next 6 months and take chunks out of the price of the ETF.  **Long Calls (Jan 2021/Jan 2022):**  * $CSCO: Cisco's WebEx solution is the market leader for videoconferencing and enterprise telepresence and their solution is more secure than Zoom's. They also pay a fat dividend and have beat earnings expectations every quarter for the last 3 years. January ***2022*** calls with a $50 strike are trading in the $3 range. $CSCO has unfairly been left behind in the tech rally. * $MO: Altria also sits on a mountain of cash and demand for cigarettes appreciates with stress, alcohol consumption and boredom. They pay a fat dividend too.  Thoughts/feedback welcome. I am holding all the above mentioned contracts (overweight on the UBER puts and CSCO calls).|2020-04-17 10:32:58

Because I imagine if I sell the 300c I bought for profit before expiration and the SP does reach 306, I would have to have shares to sell to the guy who bought my 305c.

nqluu1|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|1|Hey I am new to trading and all this and was just researching puts and calls. So from my understanding, a put is when you expect the price of a stock to drop so you can sell it for more than its worth. And a call is when you expect the price of a stock to go up so you can buy it for less than its worth. But now I have a question. In a put, when the stock is lower than the strike price, what is stopping you from buying a ton of shares of the company at a lower price in the market, and then selling all of them for the strike price agreed upon? And the inverse of this, in a call, if the price of the stock is higher in the market than the agreed upon price, is there any limit for how many shares you can buy besides the amount the seller holds? Thank you for the help as I am just a bit confused.|2020-04-17 18:47:01

Most of the patients that recovered had severe pre existing conditions and were on ventilators at the time. Using this on people with preexisting conditions and the potential need for ventilator before the ventilator is needed, it should stop the replication. No question looking into the science of it. Will work great with like 90% certainty.   China also stopped the testing due to not enough patients signing up for the trials. By the time they did the studies they were already heavily over the peak or simply didn’t wanna share that it was promising as it hurts their alternative goals  https://youtu.be/46H6jo_J4_o  Hate this guy but he’s not dumb|2020-04-17 06:21:46

One can easily be developed in a month, especially with whole world working on it. They get developed fairly quickly - 95% of the wait is just doing a million trials and getting FDA approval. This is an exceptional case where the FDA has already bypassed 90% of their trial requirements. For example, any vaccine has a mandatory 3 year animal testing phase before human trials are even allowed to begin, and they already waived that 3 year requirement for the first time in history|2020-04-17 11:18:30

He's also continuing to directly call out governors in democratic leaning states.   This, combined with the regional coalitions in New England and the Pacific Coast make for a **very** dry tinderbox.   Given the ideological differences in New England and the Pacific versus the base that Trump is riling up today, given the likelihood that Trump will win re-election, and given the lack of faith that democratic states have in him as a leader, are the pumps being primed for armed civil unrest?|2020-04-17 11:22:10

npg2h0|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|-1|Okay cuck lords, Here’s an easy position to play. Play $BAC..Hedge with $BAC puts and calls. You can get them super fucking cheap with soon expiration dates. These positions break even price is roughly $1.50 up/down. It’s been moving around that the past few days anyways. Yesterday I seen some bullshit graph some guy put on a different forum about the crash of $BAC so I bought 25 contracts at .11c expiration date today, bought around $21.60 and sold at $22.45, up this morning to +148%. Yes if I would have held I probably would be up a lot more because it’s sitting at $23.00, but I’ve lost it all in the past and I’m taking profits and not looking back. With that being said $BAC Is super fucking cheap and can make you some decent gains. The profit per loss with hedging this is little to none, this moves up .20c and you’re up $100 and I’m playing it with not a lot of money. STOP worrying about $SPY because no one here has itm positions besides the select few who bought right before the drop and or put their life savings in and are risking loosing it all reading DD on people who are DiaMonD HaNds with their $SPY $220p.|2020-04-17 12:34:38
npg92z|g2z9p8|g2z9p8|-1|Rug pull is not happening, its all horseshit.  Every beat down major company is going to soar into earnings +30%, +50%, +70% fuck it who cares.  The entire time SPY will waffle and grind higher.  Every time you buy puts on something that went up it will go up again, it will bear trap you multiple times and return to flat.  I thought SPY 300 was a "reasonablly unreasonable" target a while back, but now I think we'll hit 325+ before any real loss of momentum.  The drop will only come when the last bear is truly dead, and that could very well be at SPY 350.|2020-04-17 12:36:11

We’ll always have a bull market. No more shoddy capitalism either.   God I miss jimmy carter   I’m going to go cry about my worthless puts now|2020-04-17 10:41:33
