bhj6lk|ph24jo|ph24jo|3|MVST on a nice 3 day run here.  Finished up its SP AC merger 5-6 weeks ago, and shorts pushed it down after it tried to take off once.  But shares available to short fell below 10k a couple weeks ago and borrow fee has risen from 10-20% to 100+%.  Options are still cheap (12.5c Sept/15c Oct), and there's plenty of squeeze potential here now that it's made a nice base and risen 3 straight days.  Squeeze pressure probably comes in around the 12-15 range if it can reach there in the next 2 weeks.|2021-09-03 14:59:41

bfwgzt|ph24jo|ph24jo|9|I've been unemployed for awhile now. Let me tell y'all, it's not the fault of the unemployed. I'm still waiting on jobs that I applied six-months ago! I was scheduled for an interview yesterday, but the manager just decided to take the week off and didn't check her calendar. Now I'm waiting for another week. One time, the employer had issues with Zoom, canceled the interview and rescheduled it a month later.   I'm Black, so that's just another layer of bullshit. Folks will already have an internal ~~higher~~ hire, but just waste my time to come in so they can check off a box.   My job is in a field with a really small community, so I find out through the grapevine. Nobody makes a decision on a candidate for a  >$130,000 in less than a week. Also there's Glassdoor where people spill the beans  Corporations want to point the finger at everyone but themselves. It's easy to hire people, they are just committed to a shitty way of doing it. Cover letters, entering your resume in multiple times into a system, multiple interviews, not showing up to interviews, and ghosting candidates are just some of the bullshit people have to go through to get a job.   So fuck them.|2021-09-03 07:59:09

I know most people just sell the option but I am a little confused here.   For example,  Say stock AAA is currently $15, I set a call for $20 and it raises to $40 - say the transaction cost $300; Will I make (40-20) = $20x100 = 2000 - 300 = $1700 total profit?   Would it not be better to keep the shares? 100shares x 40 = $4,000, and it only cost me 300$.   Could I turn around and sell the individual shares for $3700 profit?     Please forgive me options gods.|2021-09-03 09:31:28

I remember them proclaiming the "bull market over".  I remember how the NASDAQ didn't hit level again until April 26th.  I remember it pulling back again and not being back to that level again until June 14th.  And these fucking üåà üêªs act like this shit where the NASDAQ was in turmoil for nearly half the year never even happened.  According to them, the old bull market ended.

Last time we were together...I broke his heart so bad he bawled :(. I literally said "I tried my hardest but I just can't find anything to love about you" I'm going to tell him I'm actually Trans and left him because I feared having to tell him if our relationship kept progressing towards marriage/children. I've always loved him. I'm praying I don't hurt him again. Any advice from yall?|2021-09-03 07:06:22
