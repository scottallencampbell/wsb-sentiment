Market is attempting to force the Fed's hand on another 0.50 rate cut in March as we speak (currently at 41% chance of 0.50 cut, 59% chance of 0.25 cut).  Don't be surprised if we're at 100% chance of a 0.50 cut at the March meeting in the next few days if there's another big selloff.

CME has us at 40% chance of a 0.50 rate cut, 60% chance of a 0.25 rate cut.  So there will be a point where the virus fears are not enough to keep pushing market down as  expectations shift to the Fed pumping us out of this mess.

He had sudden stomach pains and chest congestion like never before. “Was it the bat soup we had in Shenzen?”, he asked himself. It was. And he knew it. “Guhhh!” He threw up into the garbage can underneath his oaken desk. “There goes my fucking lunch.” He had Panda Express and he stared at the glazed noodles now looking more like his mother’s mushroom lasagna. He stared back at the computer screen, barely awake. $305. $304. $303. $302. “GUHHHH!” He mustered all of his strength to hit the Enter key, the one he relabeled as ‘PPT BUY’. With his last ounce of breath, he watched as the numbers ticked higher. $303. $304. Fuck. The laptop battery died. “I... can’t... feel... the market.” Thud.

jkx1la|fdtomr|fdtomr|6|It's been nagging at me, but it's getting harder to justify why markets would go straight back to S&P 3400 or something like that quickly.  (Of course, the way we're trading, we could be back there by Monday with 2 big up days or as soon as markets accept that the Fed will pump the markets no matter what).  Earnings are going to be bad this quarter and next.  Best case scenario is that 2020 earnings are even with 2019 overall.  But then how do we even justify S&P 3400 in a market with no earnings growth, P/E multiple expansion again?  There's just a point at which you're way overpaying for stock, and it feels like any sort of price recovery needs either a wide bottom or months of sideways/downward action like end of 2018.  That's when you could say that it makes sense to return back to the upward track.|2020-03-05 13:13:14

jksdd7|fdtomr|fdtomr|9|I'm gonna be honest. I though China was lying at first (they probably were), but I've been talking to people from China (being Chinese myself), and they have literally been on lockdown since 2/17. These are people from Shenzhen, almost 1,000 miles from Wuhan. They told me the lockdown was going to end, but some dude from Italy came in and was confirmed to have the coronavirus, and they had to restart the 14-day timer for the lockdown again. China is locking down the whole city vs. just quarantining infected people. If they are going to such extents, then its reasonable to assume their numbers should be going down. The only question is now can the US and EU do the same? Personally, I don't think so.|2020-03-05 12:29:11

On one hand supply chain is compromised, market outlook is concerning at best.  On the other where do people go to load up their bomb shelter? Costco has been outpacing the market since their last earnings report.  Additionally they have a track record of consistently beating earnings estimates.  As we know that doesn’t always mean the stock price will follow, nor does a missed earnings estimate mean the stock will necessarily drop.

This week however, after having two 4% recovery days this week we are no longer oversold technically, traders refused to rally on the FED 50 basis point cut, and rising coronavirus concerns, you would be dumb to hold over the weekend and risk more bad news materializing.

jke6rz|fdtomr|fdtomr|8|https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1235239113298759680?s=21  I’m not one to induce panic (even recently travelled to China for vacation after the outbreak) but the outbreak is going to be epic levels of bad in America. Read the whole thread. We are simply not prepared, don’t want to be prepared, and have a leader who is actively working to hide facts and silence whistleblowers. I am continuing to sell spreads to collect all this options premium but I am using it to build up cash so that I can make big moves once the virus gets really bad in the US. I’m even selling off my valuable hard assets I keep at home to get ready to buy. I feel the market isn’t properly discounting how much this will disrupt America short term. I plan to go super heavy on calls on big tech once the pandemic gets to its worst.|2020-03-05 10:21:47

We do have a downside profit targer around 2800 which is over 200 points downwards. The spread has just begun in the US, I can only see this getting worse in the immediate short term.

jl530d|fdtomr|fdtomr|7|It’s crazy how the comments shift so wildly from day to day. Yesterday, bulls were saying how idiotic bears were and that we will continue to go up, with some people using solid reasoning to justify that stance. Today it’s the same thing with bears. Rarely there are thoughtful comments, but most of it is just people trying to pump themselves up for positions they are holding. I understand the emotions and intentions behind all of this except one thing: why do people go out of their way to make nasty and insulting comments towards the other side? Can’t you psyche yourselves up without dumping on other people? Have you ever been on the losing end of a trade and read hurtful comments by others, denigrating you when you are already feeling poorly about your loss? I know I have. I don’t understand it. How about some solidarity instead?|2020-03-05 14:28:05

jk3vey|fdtomr|fdtomr|4|$CZR is going to get crushed either way the wind blows in the market. How puts aren’t at astronomical levels is beyond me. Nothing supports this company right now. Asian revenues are about to have another bad Q only amplified by COVID-19, they are raiding resort fees in Vegas when there’s no demand to support, they’re opening hotels in areas that don’t require it, Eldorado is looking to unload CZR properties in Vegas, and they will likely go back into bankruptcy.   Also the balance sheet is a legit minefield. They lifted billions in debt in other locations, have absurd interest payable, and on the PnL side if you unadjust their EBITDA they’re at like half a billion (far cry from the 1.5-2b adjusted EBITDA).

jkow2t|fdtomr|fdtomr|2|Alright, googled some of today's big gainers in my watchlist  EDIT - Editas, CRSP and NTLA have been on my watchlist for quite some time, Editas seem be in a trial to heal blind people which sounds badass - won't short  INO - Inovio seem to be developing Corona vaccine - won't short  WORK - already lost ~6% of today's gains, I think it's some work-at-home technology, earnings on 3/12, some  people say it may get bought by IBM - I won't short this either  ZM - Zoom Video, I succesfully shorted them in December for the end of lockup period, their earnings report on 3/4 seems to have been very decent and they're up almost 100% since December - may short, on the other hand all these "work during quarantine"-companies may profit off of Corona, on second thought, I don't think I'll buy puts on them either  ENPH - Enphase Energy, some solar company, no idea why they're mooning and no knowledge about them whatsoever - so maybe I'll buy some random puts  Conclusion: not gonna buy puts on big earners "because what goes up a lot must go down a lot" today, maybe I should have just bought more of my winning WYNN and DAL puts - or diversified into CCL puts - hard to convince myself to buy puts on an already well beaten down company though :/|2020-03-05 11:56:40

jjtsgn|fdtomr|fdtomr|2|Guys hear me out.  I am bearish on this market, but I've been bearish for the past 2+ years because its literally fake as fuck.  It's not based in reality.  That said - Banks, Boomers, and Hedge funds own this shit and they will do with it what they please.  All the Corona Virus is doing is giving these assholes a reason to make the market move in big swings to siphon off more money.    I fundamentally think that they will do everything in their power to keep the fun going.  Even if it means a few down days. I don't think they let this thing go lower than 290 or higher than 315 but will trade in that range until the virus news goes away.  All you gotta do is not be long and try to be on the right side of the days trend.  I wouldn't hold into the next day.  Buy in the AM sell before close if you're bound to 3 day trades a week, I wouldn't trade more than 3 times|2020-03-05 06:38:55

I found a random options creation document through a random google search result and I think it said that they partnered with LME? I have a TD/ToS account but they're partnered with CME and their list of commodities is kinda shallow.  Reason I'm interested is because with all the talk about auto manufacturers trying to make EV, Nickel is a key ingredient for NCMA and NMx batteries. GM is pumping 20 billion over the next few years and seem like they want to aggressively make EVs, so I'd imagine demand for battery ingredients would go up. LME Nickel also seems to be at a recent low, so could be a good time to buy in.|2020-03-05 13:10:07

What about when the Chinese economy truly crashes after being held up by manipulation and lies for so long.

I have in the comfortable neighborhood of $540 paper bills and a swish jug laden with coin to which I feel it may now be appropriate to set fire. I believe with this uncredible volatility due to the massing Wuhan there is some tremendous gains or losses to be had, and I want in. 100%. I am ready to walk through your door and join the ranks of WSB.   I am seeking a venue to place my meager vestments and want to form a strategy to capitalize on Wuhan and a hunch I have. People are going to still be eating sugar and sugar-based products and I feel there may be a run on it when Wuhan really hits. Where might I place my monies to take advantage of this impending rush to obtain sugar? After all summer is coming up now. American house wives are still going to be baking American pies even if viruses are everywhere. Coffee will still have to be drunk and so on. Basically America is hooked on sugar and not even Wuhan will shake that, and when the shelves get raided you can bet sugar will be in just about everyone's carts.   Thank you in advance WSB. May your plays be blessed.   TLDR: I have extra monies and am predicting a run on sugar due to Wuhan running wild. Tell me what calls or puts to make where so I can ride this sugar rush to massive profits or massive losses.|2020-03-05 08:51:18
