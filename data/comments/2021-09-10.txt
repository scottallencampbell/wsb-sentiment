ccv4k4|pli02m|pli02m|8|If you want a reason to put down the $ROPE, here's the SPY chart from today. If you just look at the past few days, you might think we're way out of the norm... but here's SPY over the past several months:     [https://imgur.com/a/01CP4Jl](https://imgur.com/a/01CP4Jl)  &#x200B;  I expect that we'll break below the trend line this month, but that's not unexpected. As far as timing is concerned, normally SPY dips down close to the trendline a couple of days before OpEx, but we're a couple of days early and it deviating from the channel is not unheard of. I'm not saying it's not going to plummet next week, but the purpose of shaping the price action before OpEx is to land below the body of calls. Prepare for more decline if you're nervous, but as of right now we're not radically out of the normal pattern.|2021-09-10 15:40:08

ccou1z|pli02m|pli02m|5|Dang based on these comments I'd think SPY and QQQ were down 3-5%.  People have been conditioned to be ridiculously bullish. If the rug gets pulled, it's gonna be ugly.  That said my thesis is still a 10-20% or so pullback over the coming months because of inflation/tapering fears. But they can't actually taper or raise rates without crashing this shit down, so then *real* inflation starts kicking in bigly and markets go back up as the dollar gets absolutely gaped. I'm talking 10-dollar HappyMeals by 2025 straight-up-fucked.  But I've been wrong once or twice before.|2021-09-10 14:55:25

ccknfr|pli02m|pli02m|3|The "glowy rocks" metal company has a market cap of around $2 billion on current prices.  But the setup looks completely broken; 90+% of shares were redeemed, and 66% of the current float is short.  The $10-15 strike calls for Sept+Oct account for >100% of all shares in the current float.  This thing will break to $50 if it gets over $15..., you'll have a complete jailbreak in terms of shares needing to be sourced for the shorts and calls.  Looks identical to IRNT and we saw how broken that was.|2021-09-10 14:25:46

Graduated college in 2008 into the worst recession. Fucked.   Finally got signed by a record label right when the music industry went to shit. Got a publishing deal, landed some music in movies and the lead singer quit. Fucked.   Started earning enough money to buy a house when the market went insane. Repeatedly. House prices always - fucking ALWAYS - are climbing higher than my income at twice the rate. Right fucked by a million dicks. (My friends who bought earlier all made a killing).   Last month I started investing. Just a couple hundred bucks. Things were going well. Put some serious money down. Mostly on safe bets. They‚Äôre ALL down. Mother fucking fuckedy fucked.   The universe has decided that I can‚Äôt ever catch a windfall. I have to fight for every fucking dollar I make.   I am solely responsible for the market being shit. As long as I have money in it, it will literally go to zero. Sell it all and direct all your rage towards me.   And call me a waaambulance.      (Yes this is satire of course. I was actually advised to start with a smaller amount and get used to dips. But god damn. It‚Äôs not easy. Is it too early to start drinking?)|2021-09-10 10:16:18

cbko03|pli02m|pli02m|0|On hold with Fidelity trying to find out why I can't buy calls or puts. All I can find out so far is that my account only has level 1 options trading and level 1 on fidelity doesn't let you do anything but sell covered calls. What I don't understand is how I have options trading on my account without being able to buy calls and puts. The page where you apply for options trading lets you select the level to apply for and it gives a description of what each level includes. I definitely selected a level that lets me buy calls and puts especially since I know for sure I would never ever select a level that only allows you to sell covered calls since I have less than zero interest in a brokerage account on US exchanges that doesn't let me buy calls and puts. So what the fuck, did they downgrade my account to level 1 when I applied for level 2, and then notify me of the application being "approved" without giving me any notification of the basic features I requested being disabled? So now I'm stuck in a 30 day waiting period before I can apply again to fix whatever went wrong? Fuck that, if Fidelity wants to scam me and keep me poor that badly I'll just close my account and go vandalize cars and the building exterior at my nearest Fidelity office. Zero chance I'm letting them get away with this without it costing them a lot of money, I'd rather go to jail.|2021-09-10 10:16:56

ccckzl|pli02m|pli02m|0|GOCO dropped because retail investors don't understand how SALES based companies (which is what GOCO is, it is sales) work.  They looked at a bad balance sheet (because they literally just increased their insurance agent workforce by 50%) and said, holy shit their labor costs are too high. They didn't realize that you have to employ and then train those people, then they produce mad fucking money for you by selling.  Retail investors don't understand that massively increasing your labor costs in sales is like a mining company buying a fuckton of diggers and drills. Yes it's a cost, but it'll turn around and produce mad money for your soon.  I've WORKED open enrollment period before for medicare and all these new agents are going to be putting in 60 hour weeks to make sales. Thats why they went balls to the walls with labor costs last quarter, so they could train all these people.  It's already running because it was massively oversold and it's gonna run like a god damn majestic deer after open enrollment results come in, habeeb it.  This is not finnacial advice.
