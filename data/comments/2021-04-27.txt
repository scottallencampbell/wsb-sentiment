w2ca38|mzl0cz|mzl0cz|7|If you plan to stay in MNMD until it at least doubles, you'll make way more money buying MindMed **warrants.**  I favor the one expiring in 2024, with stock symbol **MMDCF.**  Here's a brief explanation, with rounded figures for ease of understanding:  MNMD is currently ~$5/share. MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.  MMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.  Suppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:  **MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)  **MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)  The higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.  Since options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.  MMDCF is good. This is not financial advice.|2021-04-27 11:09:08

I know people who work in social work and psychiatry who are seeing more of an acceptance/ a move towards ketamine, psilocybin related treatments for depression, addiction etc. Surely this is worth a hold for potentially big returns down the line. I bet those people who missed out on the huge weed stock returns kicked themselves for getting out too early. This market is still very much in its infancy.|2021-04-27 13:50:18

w1yla9|mzl0cz|mzl0cz|18|I bought into most of my MVIS around 18$. This was one of the first investments I ever made. I also bought into Tilray, Webilt, and Clov for the long term.   I rode MVIS up to 29$ and was planning to hold thru today. But it appears the party is over and I'd rather not be caught with my pants around my ankles. I only had a few hundred dollars invested as this was purely for practice investing. I just wanted to invest a little, learn about stocks, research, and try to make a Lil profit.   I sold off my MVIS at around 25$ for a tidy profit of 60$ or so. Very happy as a total noob. If it pops off again later in the week I'll be bummed out but as of right now I'm just happy for playing things safer and smarter and leaving with more than I put in. I'll continue to invest as my confidence grows.   Remember, there will always be another MVIS. Don't get attached to stocks. They're not pets or loved ones. Let them go when it's their time|2021-04-27 09:31:48

w1bb3a|mzl0cz|mzl0cz|11|Stock futures are flat this morning. Nothing doing at all really. Yesterday all but the Dow Industrials were positive and the S&P and Nasdaq closed at new record highs..  It should be a busy day with plenty of earnings to move things along. As I write this, UPS just came in with a beat on earnings and revenues. That‚Äôs another good sign for the economy. During market hours we‚Äôll hear from 3M, Hasbro, JetBlue, Starbucks, Wynn Resorts, and others. After the close it will be Google/Alphabet, AMD, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, and Visa. Many others as well but those are the ones that have my attention.  We also have the start of the Fed meetings today, but shouldn‚Äôt be hearing very much from that until tomorrow.  Stocks have been quietly ‚Äòmelting up‚Äô for awhile. That may accelerate. Commodities are cranking along, with copper, wheat, corn, soybeans, and coffee at or near multi-year highs. The ‚Äòsoft commodities‚Äô (wheat, corn, soybeans) are particularly frothy. Check out the charts if you have a chance.  Until the inflation narrative takes hold and forces the Fed to start tapering it should still be all systems go for risk assets. Some earnings disappointments notwithstanding of course.|2021-04-27 05:51:12

It wouldn't break over 180 for the 2 weeks into earnings, IV was crushed into earnings to the point that straddles would be profitable.  What a coincidence.  Institutional traders can't figure out if AAPL is going to offer guidance or if iPads and services are going to miss or be a huge beat.  It hasn't broke over 135 for 2 weeks and IV is getting crushed into earnings to the point that straddles will probably be profitable.  hmmm|2021-04-27 10:15:16

w261ji|mzl0cz|mzl0cz|2|$PATH finally listed like last week. Seems kinda overvalued at the moment though they were initially going to list at $30-50 and opened high at $66, now up at $79. Revenue absolutely killing it during the pandemic last year increased by 84%.   They deal with automation software for optimizing business processes and eliminating costs associated with hiring type-monkeys, which is an absolute long-term bagger in my opinion because the license fees for their bots are fairly cheap compared to an average employee salary, they have very little direct competition outside of a few other RPA developers like Blue Prism and a few free open-source RPA alternatives, more companies need automation, and I hate data entry.  $PATH can automate my stupid ass into retirement.|2021-04-27 10:25:24

The fact of the matter is that 75% of all stocks are owned by funds etc. that wouldn't even be subject to increased capital gains taxes for individuals.  Of the 25% of the market owned by individuals, only a fraction make over $1M per year that'd be affected.  They can sell off all they want, but as retail has shown over the last few months , we can expect the rest of retail to buy any dips.

w2sa1z|mzl0cz|mzl0cz|1|Hey Autists,  &#x200B;  Here is a small part from the article regarding upcoming Apple earnings: "   Apple could crush Street estimates, writes Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, who has an Overweight rating and a $158 price target on the stock, up 17% from Monday‚Äôs close of $134.72. She sees the top line above $80 billion, with all segments growing at least 19% year over year. She is especially bullish on Mac and iPad sales, with estimates far above consensus‚Äî53% for Macs and 52% for iPads. She also expects Apple to increase its dividend by 10% and expand its stock repurchase program by $60 billion.   "  [To see the original article click here.](https://mosttraded.com/2021/04/27/apple-earnings-and-what-to-expect/)  &#x200B;  So what do you think guys, can APPL really rally after earnings?|2021-04-27 13:00:47
