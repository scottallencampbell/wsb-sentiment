d3nzoz|ppab5b|ppab5b|10|Just a friendly word of advice for any new traders on here experiencing a SPY ex-div date for the first time, I would advise against buying puts on SPY expiring tomorrow. The put contracts are getting the dividend price added into the contract prices.  You're paying an extra $1.27 for those puts. (Look at the theta values, > 1.4! for at the money puts)  It's your money but be sure you understand what you're buying.  Also, if you have short call contracts at or near the money, early assignment is a very good possibility.|2021-09-16 12:13:24

JPMorgan estimated last week China Minsheng Bank (600016.SS) has the highest exposure to Evergrande.**  > Late payments could trigger cross-defaults as many financial institutions have exposure to Evergrande via direct loans and indirect holdings through different financial instruments.  > In the dollar bond market, Evergrande accounts for 4% of Chinese real estate high-yields, according to DBS. Any defaults will also trigger sell-offs in the high-yield credit market.  > A collapse of Evergrande will have a large impact on the job market.

d30e0s|ppab5b|ppab5b|4|Two ways to avoid IV crush:    1) When checking Options Profit Calculator to see what you could    potentially make, change the IV setting to -x %. This number changes    with the stock but if a -10% is possible you might as well factor for    it. If the IV crush doesn't come then you'll be pleasantly surprised    with a higher payout than anticipated because you planned for a flood.    2) Check and see what the average Implied Volatility is for that    particular ticker. You can use shit like Market Chameleon for free but    knowing weather or not IV is high or low matters when buying calls. As a    fucking moron who only buys and doesn't sell options, I understand the    odds are already stacked against me.  These two things can prevent your    dick from being ripped off though    thanks for coming to my ted talk|2021-09-16 09:35:09

d2cjzm|ppab5b|ppab5b|16|So remember my EX from NC who I had over? She stayed for a week and I did some **absolute CLOWN shit** on the last day. She spent a week with me after 2 years of us not speaking to each other. We did a bunch of romantic stuff. I dropped her off at the airport. I was driving away back in the highway. Turned around, rushed back, parked, got through the ticket counter, through security, sprinted to her gate, made it there 2 mins before boarding, told her all my feelings, and basically I got a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know‚Äù. I pulled some **ACTUAL ROMCOM SHIT** and that's what I got from her. Felt like an ABSOLUTE ü§° (sorry IDK if the clown emoji comes through).

d3z4us|ppab5b|ppab5b|9|NEW YORK, September 16, 2021: Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASD:PLTR) will be added to the S&P Dow Jones Indices effective prior to the open of trading on Monday, September 20 to coincide with the September quarterly rebalance. Due to the large size of the addition, S&P Dow Jones Indices is seeking feedback through a consultation to the investment community to determine if Palantir should be added all at once on the rebalance effective date or in two separate tranches ending on the rebalance effective date. Palantir will replace a S&P Dow Jones Indices company to be named in a separate press release closer to the rebalance effective date.|2021-09-16 13:28:28

d31opk|ppab5b|ppab5b|1|KSU deal approved $300/share  ==  Canadian National will receive a  $700 million  termination fee as well as a  $700 million  reimbursement of a previous termination fee it covered. Kansas City Southern  and Canadian Pacific said Wednesday that their planned deal will create a railroad with roughly  $8.7 billion  in annual revenue, based on 2020 figures, and 20,000 employees. They said it would still be the smallest of the six major railroads in the  U.S. If the deal is approved, Canadian Pacific's chief executive,  Keith Creel , will lead the combined company, which will be renamed Canadian Pacific Kansas City.The smallest of the major freight railroads in the  U.S. ,  Kansas City Southern  plays a key role in  U.S. - Mexico  trade. Its trains bring autos and other industrial products up from factories south of the border into  Texas  and the Midwest and haul  U.S.  farm goods back to  Mexico . It also runs a rail link along the  Panama Canal .The combined company will create "a network that will never be replicated,"  Mr. Creel  said in an interview. He said he expects more shippers will shift from clogged  U.S.  ports to less-busy ones in  Mexico  when shipping goods to **the  U.S. The deal values  Kansas City Southern  at  $300  a share based on closing stock prices  Aug. 9 , the day before Canadian Pacific unveiled its improved offer. Shareholders would receive 2.884 Canadian Pacific shares and  $90  in cash for each  Kansas City Southern  share, and are expected to own 28% of the new company's outstanding common shares**.Canadian National shares closed up 2.1% on Wednesday, while Canadian Pacific rose 1%.  Kansas City Southern  shares were little changed, closing at  $281.48 .The transaction, which requires sign-off from both sets of shareholders, involves a two-step process. First, a voting trust would acquire  Kansas City Southern  shares and, assuming necessary approvals are granted, the companies would then merge. Canadian Pacific received approval for the trust from the regulatory panel, the  U.S. Surface Transportation Board , in May. Mr. Creel  said he expects regulatory reviews to be completed by the end of 2022. The company plans to file a merger application in mid-October to the STB, which requires major railroad combinations to be in the public interest and enhance competition.A separate review in  Mexico , where  Kansas City Southern  operates a large network, won't likely be completed until near the end of next year,  Mr. Creel  said.The companies see the deal as adding to Canadian Pacific's adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the acquisition.|2021-09-16 09:44:04

If I ride this closer to expiration and they go deep ITM max gain is .98 plus the .22 I made on the spread.
