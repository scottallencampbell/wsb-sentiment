"Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"  Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."  You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.

08zdkx|tbnppf|tbnppf|8|Since you guys loved my last hack so much, here's part two!  In case you missed part one:  > Here's a helpful trading hack that a few of the newbies might find helpful. Say you buy a stock for $100. It drops in value to $50. Now you have a 50% loss. Just sell the stock and immediately rebuy it. Now if the stock goes from $50 to $60, you'll have a 20% gain!  Now you should take a screenshot of your stock and post in this subreddit. Other folks here will see that the stock is going up and will buy it too. When they buy the stock, the price will rise. Then you can sell the stock. It's a win-win since you get some cash that you can use for groceries, and others get to own a piece of a wonderful business!|2022-03-11 09:21:54

Get to hammer it again next quarter too.  500 cars sold to date this year.  1000 all of last year.  Revised from 40k cars in 2022 to 25k cars (no way that happens).  Said 55k cars in 2023.  We have at LEAST a full year of retard inflation and high commodity prices and supply chain issues accordingly.  The big boys will have advantages with the above issues AND every month that passes, they get closer to mass produced and supported alternatives.   The 100k cars that Amazon is supposedly buying: as costs increase and the longer it takes to build them is the more time that deal becomes less and less profitable.  55k in 2023 doesn't even cover the Amazon delivery.  They will be losing money on that deal by end of next year   PLUS I'd bet my dog there is an out clause if they fuck up PLUS any good fleet dealer for the big boys is negotiating on the back with Amazon to take that contract ESPECIALLY after this horrible execution.

090kbw|tbnppf|tbnppf|4|It's a little outside the scope of this subreddit, but I figure I'll share one last hack. It's more of a relationship hack than a trading hack.  In case you missed part one:  > Here's a helpful trading hack that a few of the newbies might find helpful. Say you buy a stock for $100. It drops in value to $50. Now you have a 50% loss. Just sell the stock and immediately rebuy it. Now if the stock goes from $50 to $60, you'll have a 20% gain!  And here's part two:  > Now you should take a screenshot of your stock and post in this subreddit. Other folks here will see that the stock is going up and will buy it too. When they buy the stock, the price will rise. Then you can sell the stock. It's a win-win since you get some cash that you can use for groceries, and others get to own a piece of a wonderful business!  For this last hack, you take a screenshot again. Then you show it to your family/loved ones. For example, your husband or wife might be worried that you've been losing money. Your parents might be worried that you're wasting your life day trading instead of going to school or getting a job. But now if you show them your 20% gain, they'll see that you're a brilliant investor and will stay out of your way. They might even give you some of their money to invest on their behalf! Your loved ones are wonderful people who care about you, and you owe it to them to relieve some of their stress or even delight them with tales of your gains!|2022-03-11 09:30:01

08kho1|tbnppf|tbnppf|4|Stay in cash gang bois!!!  Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping after having risen, this is the most reliable indicator signaling significant moves in the stock market. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. The s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now) Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.  AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.  Bull cases: WW3 might not happen. Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-03-11 07:29:36

0a42q5|tbnppf|tbnppf|4|🧸 It's  🧠 Thinky Brens Time 🧠 - with BEAR FACTS! 🧸 ====  ----   Many people imagine that Prof. Robert Shiller's 'CAPE10' measure is a tool for timing the market.  https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe  When the CAPE10 is high, the market is about to crash, surely? Not so!   As any old grizzly will tell you, the CAPE is a tool for figuring out probable long-term returns, not a timing guide! [CAPE10 has been found to predict 90% of the variation in future 10-year returns from stock market investment.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2020/07/20/the-remarkable-accuracy-of-cape-as-a-predictor-of-returns-1)  So what kind of return can you expect if you recently invested at the peak, and 'diamond hands' hold all the way to the year 2032, after ten years of your life have passed?

It would be equally wrong to expect that a fall from overvalued, to more fairly valued, couldn’t badly overshoot on the downside." — Seth Klarman  "There is a considerable tendency for common stock investors to do the greater part of their buying, both of “good” and “bad” securities, at high levels of the market. They are equally inclined to do the greater part of their selling at low levels of the market, a procedure which is not conducive to successful results." — Benjamin Graham  "It is only in a bear market that the value investing discipline becomes especially important because value investing, virtually alone among strategies, gives you exposure to the upside with limited downside risk." — Seth Klarman  "The novice soon learns that stocks are likely to maintain an upward or downward trend for long periods of time with minor interruptions of the major trend." — Philip Carret  "The most important lesson an investor can learn is to be dispassionate when confronted by unexpected and unfavorable outcomes." — Peter Bernstein  "Discrepancies — and hence opportunities — in securities originate most often when events move faster than quotations." — Benjamin Graham.   🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸|2022-03-11 13:44:43

0aav2l|tbnppf|tbnppf|2|--  **The CAPE Ratio**: By the Shiller CAPE measure the US market would need to fall roughly 50% to get to the average again. To reach historical 'cheap' levels, we would be looking at a 75% drop from here.   https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe  --  **Market dividend yield**: If we see a 1.5-2.5% rise in interest rates and the market dividend yield increases similarly, the US market is looking at a 50% drop from here. To reach the levels that were achieved historically to control inflation, we would need a 75% drop in the SP500 from here.   --  **The Buffett Ratio**: By the Buffett indicator the US market would need to fall by around 50% to reach the average again. To reach historical 'cheap' levels we would be looking at a 75% drop from here.   https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php  --  **Price to Sales Ratio**: Sales tend to be a lot more stable than earnings over long periods so they are a useful standard candle by which to measure overvaluation. The SP500 price to sales is 3.2 just now. The historical average is around 1.60 depending on which measure you take. The low is 0.8. This implies a 50% drop in the SP500 from here to get back to historical average valuation, or a 75% drop if we revisit historical lows.|2022-03-11 14:32:01

Wanted to buy the dip and flip it quickly. It kept tanking so I bought more. Then in a moment of clarity, I thought this seriously brain dead and beyond stupid and sold for a little loss. Next trading day it got halted and its still halted. The very next day they halted trading on all russian stonks.  10k would have been stuck in limbo land for the next 75 years until they open their markets to the west again. Or they open and its worth zero.  Not sure what I was thinking, morally and from a risk perspective. Maybe I'll join everyone else and short the ruble instead.|2022-03-11 11:12:22

Not so!   As any old grizzly will tell you, the CAPE is a tool for figuring out probable long-term returns, not a timing guide! [CAPE10 has been found to predict 90% of the variation in future 10-year returns from stock market investment.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2020/07/20/the-remarkable-accuracy-of-cape-as-a-predictor-of-returns-1)  So what kind of return can you expect if you recently invested at the peak, and 'diamond hands' hold all the way to the year 2032, after ten years of your life have passed?

08gh9h|tbnppf|tbnppf|-4|Why do you idiots think you can know why the market moves? Your supposedly rational explanation is just some random pattern recognition based on subjectively correlated data, objectively speaking its non-causal. You see some article or a tweet (there is always gonna be a datapoint in a world of infinite information) and assume there is a connection. Thus, you assume the market to be 'rigged' or 'fake' when it doesn't move as it "should". There is no "should" in the market, there is not "should" for the algorithms. The market does what it does, you can't explain it. You can keep sitting here for hours and days and weeks and months, thinking your shitty pattern recognition capacities makes a difference, and it never will. You're a gambler wasting your time, feeling a surge of positive emotion when your guess is right, and a corresponding negative surge when you're wrong. The fact of the matter is that you're always lagging behind, the data you're getting is always after the fact, and hence irrelevant.|2022-03-11 06:53:16
