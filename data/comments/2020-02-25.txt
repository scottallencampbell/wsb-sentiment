iq4gho|f98o73|f98o73|85|My prediction:   Coronavirus is way more widespread than people realize but actually a much milder disease. You might even have had it and thought it was a bad cold.  Up until the last few days, most countries have only been testing people that traveled so they just haven't found that many cases. However, over the next week or two authorities will start testing more generally and they will find cases. Lots of them. The vast majority of these will be people in hospitals, the most sick, and quite a few of them will die.  This will create a huge media panic because it will make the case fatality rate look terrible. The authorities will also panic and lock shit down. This won't be good for stocks. However, about two weeks to a month later they will start to realize that basically everyone had the virus and didn't die. Buy calls just before this.

iq7cn3|f98o73|f98o73|10|yo for real can someone please convince me that stocks are not heavily manipulated so that MM can direct the flow of a price trend and contain it within certain limits?  PTON looked like yesterday was suppose to be the nail in the coffin. There were so many puts purchased. MM's would've lost a ton of money if the puts had gone in the  money. So what happens? PTON rallies on an otherwise atrocious day for the market.  TSLA's max pain is 830 and there are like a billion puts at 700, so it seems, like someone posted in yesterday's thread, that based on the open interest of puts, that TSLA would stay between the 850-930 channel this week. And what do you know? TSLA looses one of its bulls with a downgrade from buy to hold last night and it is up 20 points from premarket. (he did raise the PT, so that helps but the downgrade prolly does not).  I'm holding TSLA calls and PTON calls. So I am not salty. I just want to understand better. Do MM have that much sway over the pricing of a stock?  (if anyone has any resources on this, please send them to me cause I'd love to read them.)|2020-02-25 07:27:30

It goes on to say everyone is expecting for no disruption to occur and that's why they have taken on so much debt, but this could backfire if basically some type of rogue wave occurs in the markets causing it all to come toppling. Since they no longer have this rating it affects their ability to now offer bonds at a cheap rate to cover the shortfall.   I wonder if this could be a big enough rogue wave.|2020-02-25 13:38:36

VIX should still be up. if you're paper hands, make sure you have a DT to burn at EoD. grab it before IV really pushes around 11-noon. literally any VIX (non-inverse unless you want to ride puts on that) ETF. bought at open. return 52% as i type this.  also the 10-year treasury calls i bought 28m ago are at a 31% return.  if you don't understand the metrics of market sentiment and you're losing money, be dumb as hell like me and make bets on sentiment. this isn't getting better and SPY has had five green minutes in 25 minutes.   that's my DD for you: it may be worth considering that on a short-term basis you consider thinking like a bull that doesn't want to get killed while folks continue to throw-in on calls/puts directly related to single-rep stickers. sentiment is fucked right now. gold was shown to be problematic yesterday. keep an eye on a live SPY chart and try to time your buy in the middle of a green bar meeting high volume resistance.   and have a daytrade available just in case you trust bullshit you read on the internet.   i'll take a large baconator with cheese and a diet coke. biggie diet coke, please. thank you.|2020-02-25 09:42:51

Those leathery flaps." Do you know how strong a bat is? It would rip your dick off like a celery stalk. Throw that shit in the tall grass to never be seen again. Hey, dog, were gonna go to the club, pick up some girls, you trying to roll? "No, man, I'm cool. I'm gonna stay home dog, chill with my bat soup‚Äù|2020-02-25 08:24:35

ir90av|f98o73|f98o73|3|forgot to update after we hit the 3144 level on ES  MAGICAL LINES TA  after the 3144 level, the next extension down was the 3122ish which we hit and are currently bouncing around at. next extension target down is 3104. if we hit this, that would mean S&P500 is at -4% on the day. Vix has sky rocketed to 30 which is an extreme bearish sign. If Vix continues to go up and we don't make any lower highs (cause lets be honest this has almost been a straight down), the extension target past 3104 is 3075. I genuinely did not think we'd hit 3122 today which has made this back to back 3% red days|2020-02-25 13:42:45

Bought a single SPY put with a few days on it. If we get down to 305 I‚Äôll sell it and maybe have a grand. I think this has better odds of recovering a few bucks than waiting a month to get the same gain.   If I timed the bottom, I‚Äôll just let small biweekly cash deposits build the account back up over time and start buying calls again after things restabilize.
