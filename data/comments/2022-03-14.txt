And now likely buying hand over fist.  Their downgrades are to less than a third of cash for some of these names. Pretty insane.  More insane is SEC/admin allowing this all to happen. It's very bad for American investors. They were the ones who let them onto US exchanges which led to massive influxes of cash to Chinese companies.  And then when China is pushing full control on everything - that's when they say audits are needed and threaten to delist by 2024 or 3 years?

0m131a|tdtz2p|tdtz2p|17|70% of Chinese wealth is in housing.  When that bubble pops, it's going to send a massive deflationary shock across the world, bigger than the US financial crisis.  China's doing everything it can to prop up housing values as their property development groups implode, but it can't work forever.   At some point, they have to accept the inevitability that 25-30% of a nearly developed economy can't be housing/real estate.  (Developed/highly urbanized countries are well under 20% outside of peaks of boom/bust cycles).  There was a 2 year lag from the US housing bust starting and the financial crisis.  Could be longer in China given they cannot afford the results of a housing price collapse... though it's inevitable given their demographic inverse pyramid and urbanization starting to plateau.|2022-03-14 07:56:53

Or do they stop this and let capitalism sort of keep boosting economy?  Does US go red in November? If so - will they mean anything for economy?  How will ukraine invasion end? Will Russia install a leader in Kyiv and then call it quits?  Will a global recession happen as a result of a much needed push to curb inflation? Will China crackdowns turn a global recession into a domestic depression?  Tldr; 2022 may make 2020 look normal|2022-03-14 08:53:51

This is essentially Barclay's saying, shits about to hit the fan, and if too many investors have insurance in case of crash we'll go insolvent too.|2022-03-14 13:01:42

Putting out fake news that Russia needs China to deal with the situation, so that when it doesn't happen he looks strong like they took care of the issue by looking sternly at China. God he's such a turd, can't believe I voted for that tool.   In other news the Russians just told the UN that Ukraine might use chemical weapons against them. So do we get puts?|2022-03-14 13:50:34

Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. The s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now) Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.  AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.

However, Ukraine is going to have to surrender to Russia too and accept their terms. There is no alternative for them. Ukraine will never be accepted into NATO anyway so why would they die on the hill of not accepting Russia’s terms? They have no other option.

0mauk1|tdtz2p|tdtz2p|1|10:13 AM EDT, 03/14/2022 (MT Newswires) -- Affirm Holdings(AFRM) said Monday that it is on track to exceed its fiscal Q3 and full-year 2022 projections as its financial performance has exceeded expectations.        The company now expects fiscal Q3 revenue of at least $335 million, and projected 15% or better in adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue. That compared with prior estimates for revenue in the range of $325 million to $335 million and an adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 19% to 21% in the quarter.        For fiscal 2022, Affirm estimated at least $1.31 billion in revenue and 11% to 13% in adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue. The company previously projected $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion in revenue and 12% to 14% in adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue.|2022-03-14 09:17:21

Anyone with have a brain that knows what Ryan is capable of would never sell in a million years or under a million dollars.  Once his vision for $GME comes out people will regret falling for this oh-so-obvious manipulation.  Ryan wants Gamestop to be way more than just a store and it will be.    I would not be surprised if gamestop became the center of crypto / nft gaming and helped usher in web3.0 to the masses.  adoption is growing exponentially and because of that will continue to do so.
