It’s damn worth it at sub $30. Stop being idiots controlled by emotion and remember the scripture: “when others are greedy be fearful. When others are fearful be greedy”.   Ask yourself this. Is PLTR a shit ass company that was only a meme like SNDL? No. It’s a legit company with a legit plan. So when you see a dip like this you buy.

They somehow got access to my email, password, and used my finger print to log in somehow.  This sick bastard even knew my mother’s maiden name and the name of my first childhood pet.  Then they used my Robinhood Debit card to buy a bunch of PLTR merchandise. Who would do something like that?  Anyways please refund my money ASAP, rent is due soon and I’m looking at a margin call.

Also Papa Karp basically said fuck off to gamblers saying this is a long term investment and should look elsewhere for short term gains. They don't give a fuck about quarterly earnings and do not plan on losing sight over quarterlies.

no5kzx|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|11|Starter guide to finding a stock before it explodes: Look up 12 unpopular stocks, most likely very cheap with a small market cap.  The number 12 is really important here, you are doomed to fail if you pick more or less.  Number these stocks, 1 through 12. The number 1 will be your least favorite. Take 2, 6 sided dice. Roll both dice. Whatever you're number is, DO NOT BUY THAT STOCK. Refer back to you're "number 1," aka your least favorite stock. Invest in that stock. Thank me later|2021-02-16 12:03:46

This would be the largest in a string of SPAC deals for EV makers.  Churchill has initiated talks with investors to raise more than $1 billion by selling shares in a private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction for the deal with Lucid, Reuters reported.  These funds would be in addition to the $2 billion Churchill raised in its July IPO.

To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds, which are now valued at about $50,000. Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of the WallStreetBets page on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock’s colossal rise.  He didn’t want to touch his index-fund investments, so instead he got a personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to fund most of his GameStop purchase.  He bought shares at $234 each."

The projected growth for the price per pound of uranium is approx 26% for years 2020-2030. However, with the increase of electricity demands rising and worries about carbon emissions, the demand for uranium powered energy can only rise. Hence, DNN (uranium mine in Canada) appears to be a solid bet for growth this year especially with the expected price rebound for uranium in 2021.|2021-02-16 13:50:06

nozzyg|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|9|Yes, Melvin has 6M shares worth of put options.   No, you can’t trigger a short squeeze from this, puts don’t require buying shares from the market.   If you buy anticipating a short squeeze I am sorry to be the one breaking the news to you. If you drive the price up their puts will expire worthless, yes, but they never have to buy your shares from you. New GME crew I’m sorry to break the news to you|2021-02-16 15:48:13

Finally pulled the trigger now that they issued new shares at 22.00. Few reasons why I think it will blow up in the coming months: Having Lithium mines in US soil will become a matter of national security, just like having enough oil reserves. With the Biden admin putting clean energy as a focus, batteries (lithium) will be needed everywhere to store all that clean energy. Electric cars are becoming and will become the norm within the next decade. You get the gist. Cellphones, computers, watches, home energy storage, planes will adopt more and more hybrid tech, etc. So im very bullish on them.|2021-02-16 14:11:16

nosh96|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|5|Palantir Lays Out Growth Targets Following Public Debut  BY Dow Jones \&amp; Company, Inc.   — 3:51 PM ET 02/16/2021  Palantir Technologies Inc. ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) shares dropped sharply Tuesday after the data-mining company laid out its expectations for revenue growth over the next few years and said it would beef up its sales force.  Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) has joined a cohort of firms whose market debuts have been welcomed by many investors, some of whom are looking for technology-driven companies to grow rapidly to justify their valuations. The Denver-based company, which provides software focused on helping businesses as well as defense and intelligence agencies analyze data, saw its shares rise from a $10 debut in a direct listing in September to as high as $39 in late January, according to FactSet.  The stock has fallen since then and traded down about 12% to $28.05 Tuesday afternoon, as executives said they expect Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) to generate revenue growth of more than 30% annually over the next five years. That rate could potentially be slower than the 47% gain it recorded for 2020 compared with 2019.  The company isn't "focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, near-term focus that, quite frankly, destroys businesses," said Chief Executive Officer Alexander Karp. "It's one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech, are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients," he added.  Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) plans to expand its sales team by triple-digit levels this year, operations chief Shyam Sankar told investors Tuesday.  Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) executives said the company reached deals with corporate clients including miner Rio Tinto PLC, utility Pacific Gas and Electric and oil giant BP PLC. They also said Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) would push to expand its work with the federal government, noting recent agreements with the U.S. Army.  Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) reported a narrower fourth-quarter loss of $148.3 million, or 8 cents a share, on $322.1 million in revenue. For 2020 as a whole, it lost $1.17 billion on about $1.1 billion in revenue. Stock-based compensation was a major expense last year, the company said.|2021-02-16 14:53:01

To really grasp how tough this lil motherfucker was, imagine hitting sand hard enough to bounce. You'd turn into liquid. Now imagine bouncing hard enough to still have 25 bounces left.

Also seen a quarterly cash flow where they kept adding the previous quarter to the next quarter. i.e if they had 500 each quarter it read as 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 making it seem like 5,000 in cash flow instead of 2,000.

nnjdza|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|3|Roku make you Richu.   Roku gave no guidance after q3 2020 but lowballed 45% growth in q4 because that’s what happened last year. Q4 we will likely see almost 100% yoy rev growth along with profitability due to Roku OneView. Look at profit margins of TTD, that’s what OneView brings and it’s going to hit the bottom line like it did for the surprise q3 profit.   Can’t wait until we get projections of 60-80% rev growth next year and profitability projections from here on out. Those growth numbers are most certainly lowballing it, but everybody knows that so it’s fine. 2nd in Cathies ARKK behind TSLA. Second straight quarter of profitablity puts it on the path to be included into S and P. Momentum here is already incredible.   This company will be next tech giant and will certainly at least be as big as Netflix which has over 200b market cap. It was started by Netflix after all. They knew a simple streaming platform was needed to help all companies stream efficiently.  Question is how high will earnings pop take us? It’s going to be a great quarter. How much is priced in? My projection is 600. But I’m also autistic.    02/19 500c   Holding through earnings|2021-02-16 09:18:39

nnmoo2|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|5|The market is too strong right now, the dips are just going to get bought by literally all of retail and the algos. Smart money understands the significance of psychology and perfectly round numbers like SPY 4,000. However, as everyone has said millions of times, we are overdue for a 5-7% pullback, which will very likely be at the 4,000 level where big boys will dump. Riding calls until then. Should be quick, like 1-2 days until 4,000 then loading whole portfolio into SPY 370/375Ps|2021-02-16 09:44:25

I don't wanna be greedy and I don't know what I'm doing. I look at the eps ratio and can't help but think I just got lucky.

As the animal approaches, the barest movement can be seen as bits of soil faintly stir. The animal pauses to sniff the ground.   Suddenly, a hand shoots up from the dirt. The animal pulls back, but it is too late. The grip is like iron. The earth splits open, and the fetid corpse of a man flies out. It leaps onto the animal’s back, teeth and nails tearing at the animal’s throat. The bear collapses as its life savings drains away.  The monster finishes its meal quickly, and as stumbles off into the trees, it gurgles something out in a guttural, nearly unintelligible drawl:  “Stonks... only... go... up...”|2021-02-16 12:18:15

Imho, $SPCE was relatively priced-in so far due to the test-flight hype, but that seems to have died down. Virgin Galactic also seem to have learnt from their mistake and are doing much more thorough pre-flight checks now. This flight cannot go tits up. The only thing to discuss right now is when the deepest dip is going to occur.

I believe the employees know the worth of the company they work for and i dont see a huge dump occurring.  But again I could be completely wrong.

They could care less about bond yields and hiking rates. These would only serve to stop them from getting a job. Systemic racism of the past was designed to stop them from getting jobs. Powell is trying to right the ship and Yellen and Biden are on board. This is also why Trump wanted low rates, and even Powell indicated Black and Latino unemployment was lowest in history month before pandemic took effect. There will be no crash yet.

This year we have a new more dangerous catalyst for the end of Feburary going into March that will rock the foundations of the market.  Rising interest rates. Bonds go up, stocks go down, housing prices sink, banks need more on reserve, lending seizes, margin is called, fuckery occurs and markets sink.  You have been warned.|2021-02-16 11:51:25

nnsu9w|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|3|THE END IS HERE  Stock Funds See Biggest Inflows Ever as BofA Warns Top is here  In one week ending this past Wednesday, $22.9 billion flowed into stock funds.  This has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.  In 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed. Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.  BofA’s gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull & Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn’t been set off since January 2018, according to the note.  BofA b&b indicator before 2008 sell off: 8.0  Current BofA b&b indicator: 7.8  Fed to test bank ability to withstand 55% fall in equity price  S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio  In Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller’s book *Irrational Exuberance*, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today’s Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades.   Dot com bubble: 44  Today: 35   Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.  The current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett [said](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/12/10/314691/index.htm) the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. "If the ratio approaches 200%—as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000—you are playing with fire," said Buffett.  Current Buffet Indicator: 195%  Dot com bubble Indicator: 159%  Margin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion—nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It’s currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble.|2021-02-16 10:30:41

Took a long hiatus due to college stress and everything. Started jelqing again from 2017 and took some months of hiatus off up until now. I measured myself recently and grew just a bit over 7 inches. It’s a good area to be in but I’m going to experiment with penis enhancement pills and do other penile exercises to see if I can grow to a monstrous 9+.

nngsx1|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|1|I have high functioning autism. My perspectives of life and how to go about things often tend to be a bit different from others. The nature of my trading is also a bit different from most people. I believe that yoloing is natural and accepting, while the vast majority of people around me see it as something extremely controversial and overly complicated. Abuse of power dynamics, objectification, trauma inducing, all the negative stigmas that normies generally correlate with options. Idk how it manages to be like that to a lot of normies, because my general way of thinking is just different, so while I may be able to get the idea, I can’t really relate to it at all. Now I’m a bit curious to know, and you are free to not answer me if you’d like, but how many of my fellow autists are also on the spectrum?

nnzq2k|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|0|Just sharing my thoughts and strategy  Im know expert options trader by any means but I have taken notice to a strategy that has sent me up over 200% on the year, yes I realize the market has been good. But I have received numerous tips from you guys on here and just wanted to try and share something that I do. I check the WSJ everyday for market upgrades and have found that if you take a stock that has been recently upgraded and has a relatively good open interest on the option, there is room to net profit consistently. I only started with about $600 (I’m still in college and don’t have money) and have gotten it up to $2200 and climbing since the first of the year by doing this. The most important thing is to set a profit % you are comfortable taking on every trade. Mine is 40% that I aim for but sometimes will settle in the 30s if I’ve held it for longer than a week. This is just something I found works for me and I felt selfish not sharing it because I have gotten some good food for thought on this page. And if anyone is interested I just opened a position on $ETN April 16 $135 call. They were just upgraded today and I see the same potential I’ve seen all year with my picks. If anyone’s interested in when I sell just comment and I’ll be sure to let you know.|2021-02-16 11:21:03

nnfs99|ll1ir4|ll1ir4|-18|just wanted to get this off my chest,  today i decided i was going to do 7 day survivor in dead rising. me and frank have done some really big challenges together but this would take the cake for the hardest one. it's for infinity mode, where you have to survive as long as possible while you slowly lose health and have to fight off crazed survivors. 7 day survivor is exactly as it sounds, survive for 7 days. and that's not too bad, except that time passes very slowly. 7 days is equivalent to 14 real time hours.  a lot of it is spent camping in spots with food stashes, giving frank food and waiting for time to pass. so it's not 14 hours of straight playing but the fact you cannot save the game means it has to be 14 hours nonstop. it's a very stressful challenge to do but me and frank were prepared to do it.  fast forward several hours and we've set up our next camping spot, we have more food than accounted for, and i've done the math to figure out what time we will be moving at (to avoid survivors). i feed frank, making sure he is at full health, and go to make myself a coffee.  i had explained to my mom about how i was doing this achievement, so i'd be having to check back at my computer every several minutes to ensure frank was fed. she was well aware of this and it all seemed really fine, until after i had made my coffee, she had me stuck telling me stories about when she lived in a bedsit with a pothead and hoarder. i made it clear several times i needed to go, but she didn't let me till she had finished her story. once i finally manned up and said i had to go, i came back to find that frank had starved, and i had to begin again.  several hours of work down the drain. before, i had ensured it would not go on past midnight, but now that is down the drain and i'll have to stay up through the night to make up for the lost time.  but also what hurts, and it's probably silly, is the idea that i let frank starve like that. that because i wasn't strong enough to tell my mom to shut up and let me get back to what i was doing, that he starved because of me. and when we had a full stash of food too. it's not even a quick death like if a survivor shot him. it was the most slow way he could have died and it hurts. i never let frank die on my watch. i totally messed up and not only did i hurt myself from this but i hurt frank too.  i'm so mad at myself. i'm so mad and upset and frustrated. i'm going to have a blunt to try and mellow out but god i feel so bad. i've had such a bad week. yesterday was horrible and i thought i could have a nice day doing work inbetween checking on frank and tackling this task but nothing is going my way this week. everything is so damn bad and i keep fucking up. i fucked up and i hurt him.  edit: my mom compared me to my estranged dad for even caring about achievements in games which has just poured fuel on the fire. my dad cared more about his game consoles than raising his own child for 18 years and to imply i'm like him because i am trying to get a single achievement hurts me so much. i thought i was calming down but bringing my dad into this just made everything hurt again. i'm better than my dad. i am not him. i have a job and i'm in a loving marriage, not one held together with chewing gum and sellotape. fuuuck. im so upset.
