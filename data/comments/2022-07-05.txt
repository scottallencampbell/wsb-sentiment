They wanted to go slow as to not shock the market but bonds sold off anyway and quickly went straight to the terminal rate.   So basically, if the bond market knows the terminal rate there’s no benefit to going slowly. The bond market will go there anyway pretty quickly so might as well hike at that same pace.|2022-07-05 14:19:04

I think people are starting to realize that inflation may come down now but it isn't because of anything good.   People also need to realize the last two years have really been unprecedented.  It's hard to say how this all ends by comparing to past economies and markets.  We've seen markets crater the year of the recession, the year after a recession and both the year during and after a recession.  The last report on the housing market even had a national price drop for the first time in forever.  The housing market is flipping fast.  If the housing market tanks circuit breakers will be something we see in our future.|2022-07-05 09:18:04

Economic conditions started to crater in mid-June after that rate hike was priced in...  Just shows how addicted to cheap/easy money the US economy got.  June/July economic data is likely going to come in pretty bad, and I expect the strong US jobs gains that we were experiencing pre-June to end pretty fast (next 3 months jobs growth will go from 300k to sub-100k).  Things will work out eventually, but this is medicine that the economy needed; way too much irrationality with investments (see Cathie Wood/stocks going vertical past 2 years) and housing markets (housing prices went stupid) due to Fed liquidity.|2022-07-05 09:06:30

exupuf|vrubz8|vrubz8|0|This sort of reminds me of the US dollar surge back in 2000-2001 as the tech bubble burst and US experienced a much milder recession than Europe/Asia.  Basically tells us that once again in this monetary bubble bust conditions are much worse in Europe/Asia than in the US.  That is a decent measure of good news.  US recession will most likely be pretty mild with housing markets bearing the brunt of it as they freeze up (but without a financial crisis like 2008).  We may see a few months of job losses by the end of this year/early next but jobs market is much tighter than previous recessions due to boomers retiring.  I think the key thing is that US inflation can moderate by November-December pretty strongly if the dollar continues to surge and a much worse recession overseas is priced in...  Basically, all of this is bullish for October and beyond.  Until then we likely have a lot of chop/downside to go through as markets try to price in the extent of the recession.|2022-07-05 08:29:37
