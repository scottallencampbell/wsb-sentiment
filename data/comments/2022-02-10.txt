tsn09a|mmog6c|mmog6c|60|Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far.   Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That‚Äôs as of 0640.  This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.  Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it‚Äôs not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn‚Äôt expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it.   We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week‚Äôs 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.  That‚Äôs all we got today. Don‚Äôt worry, next week earnings kick off and things should get more interesting.|2021-04-08 05:50:13

If Hwang was 85% levered in January, and then left those positions alone, he would still be about 85% levered now - meaning that he would not have gotten any margin calls, his prime brokers wouldn‚Äôt have had to sell any stock, he‚Äôd still be worth many billions of dollars and his brokers would still be clipping fat fees without any losses.|2021-04-08 07:20:09

tudnhy|mmog6c|mmog6c|21|Kinda feel bad for the GME crowd. You can tell there are a lot of first time investors that are now roped up into this. The expectations... are unrealistic to say the best, with people saying it could hit 1 million a share and being serious about it. Saw one person sold his GF's engagement ring and if GME "dosen't work out she'll have to wait another year or so" (hopefully that was a troll). There are smart people that that got in and out at the right time, and even now people with low average cost per share are in a decent position, but the constant desperation to get people to buy into GME has really grown out of control. If GME dosn't go up (personally I think it may a bit but I think the squeeze already happened) it's gonna leave so many young people in a bad position.|2021-04-08 14:03:27

tt7hjh|mmog6c|mmog6c|3|PFGC is a stock I've been in and out of for years.  They're a foodservice company.  They sell food and other items to restaurants and they cut a lot of high end steaks.  One of their steak cutting operations sold $450,000 of steaks last week.  Their meat business is double what it was just a few months ago.  Mainly due to restaurants opening back up but also because they diversified during COVID, selling to supermarkets, and still have that business with no sign of it going away. It's lookin pretty tasty to me.  ![gif](emotefree_emotes_packthumbs_up)|2021-04-08 09:00:06

ttjups|mmog6c|mmog6c|15|My APHA story:  Going to repost my story here since many of you are feeling beat down and I already see comments encouraging you to leave your positions (I also hold Cresco so no bias from me):  Time in the market will always be better than timing it. I held onto APHA through the short report, bad press, not so great financials for years and pressure to sell. At the time I bought at the peak in 2017.   Saw my shares go down to $2 and didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. Family pressure and friends pressuring to sell. Saying that saving is the way and that I was being irresponsible. So I doubled down on every drop I could.   By November my average share price was now 6.45 instead of 17 or 18 (can‚Äôt remember exactly). Elections roll around (exactly why I was BUYING MORE) and then we saw the results. 3 long years of me constantly looking at losses and feeling like complete shit because I had told people about my investments and of course people will always remind you of your mistakes every time they can (don‚Äôt do what I did be quiet).   February rolls around and those same friends didn‚Äôt even ask. They knew. They knew I was right then and they know I am right today. There is no better feeling in the world and your day will come young grasshopper. You need to buy more. That‚Äôs it. Is it shares? Not options? Buy more. Is this industry going anywhere else but up? No. I‚Äôm still holding those shares and didn‚Äôt sell at the ‚Äútop‚Äù because that was t the top period.   I am holding indefinitely because that‚Äôs how you build wealth. Not by hoping In and out of trades because somewhere along the way you‚Äôre gonna probably make a mistake. Few day traders are able to come up with (at peak) +300% return. The likelihood of you being able to do that? Not so likely.   Hold your shares. Buy more. Period.  APHA April 16th 27C, April 23 19C and Jan 22 22C to the fucking moon!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ  420is for WEED. Earnings on Monday will break this stupid Downtred!

ttky9d|mmog6c|mmog6c|7|Why 420 is important in Weed culture and why I‚Äôm exclusively in Cannabis stocks:  It‚Äôs okay to have beers and shoot. It‚Äôs okay to drink alcohol every day if you choose to. It‚Äôs ok to have employment with government agencies if you drink. You can serve in the military if you drink. You will have no problems with a security clearance if you drink.  None of the above is okay if you switch it to weed.  Things have to change and considering how Biden and Harris contributed to putting people in jail for a plant during their careers, their silence is unacceptable.  We sit here selfishly making money but what about the people that are locked up? The people that had their resumes tarnished forever? People of color and vulnerable people in general? When are we going to fight for them and raise our voices that this isn‚Äôt okay?  Are you fine with making money while knowing very well other people had their lives completely destroyed?

It's a fairly valued stock at $4.  It's not going to double because of memes.  Even if it does, it'd revert back to trend within days.

tsxlyy|mmog6c|mmog6c|3|So this whole ASO mess is wildly exaggerated as a bad thing. I see it as one of two possibilities. In order from awesome to ok  1. Bullish whale wants to take a large position but the liquidity on the open market is so low that buying even 100k at a time would increase the price too fast and too much to work out so they are working out a block deal with another whale.  2. Bearish whale wants to close (or maybe reverse the position after seeing what happened with GME) and is working out a deal so they prevent a squeeze since the stock is visible on wsb. This reduces the likelihood of a squeeze but doesn't change the fact that ASO is a great company.  Yes I read the zerohedge article. Yes zerohedge is still trash.|2021-04-08 07:36:35

ttvr2g|mmog6c|mmog6c|2|Can someone let me know if this is a terrible idea or not. Say someone doesn't own any GME today but wants to get involved. Would it be a decent idea to buy 100 shares (total cost roughly $17,500.00) use those to sell a LEAP call (Jan 20, 2023 150C) for $10,000.00 and use the $10,000 credit to buy 57 shares? You'd technically own 157 shares at an average cost of $111.46 and if your LEAP call gets exercised at any point you'd be left with 57 shares at an average cost of $43.86.

tu21u7|mmog6c|mmog6c|1|Looking for insight on (T) and would great appreciate a guru‚Äôs thoughts. I really thought there would be a rally today in AT&T. But it seems like someone is offload truck loads of share to tank it. I‚Äôve followed T for a while now and it always seems the shorts win and prevent what seems like organic grow in a solid company. Even on a day where one would think buy demand is high to take advantage of its great dividend... I find some Shmoe drop massive 46000 share sell orders and lower and lower prices.  Can anyone provide some further insight for me?  Currently getting hammered on my yolo 180 4/16 32call bought at .17 that I‚Äôve watched for over a month go to .015|2021-04-08 12:40:12
tu231l|mmog6c|mmog6c|1|Watching AMC get crushed reminds me of this time I had a hermit crab. It changed shells and I was so excited, I grabbed it and ran outside to show my mother.  It didn't like that, and it wanted me to know in know uncertain terms that it didn't like that, so it reached out and pinched the fuck out of my hand.  Then when I got used to that pain, it doubled down, and squeezed even harder.  That was a level of pain I'd never known at that point in my life.  This isn't as bad as that, but it does remind me of it.  Watching AMC be at 9.60 for a while, thinking  "Huh, interesting. Odd. Meh. Whatever, discount. Wish I could buy in, but meh, I can sell a put for 8.50 because I could stand to buy 100 more shares at that price."  Then I look again what feels like 30 seconds later and it's down to 9.50.  It gives me that same feeling.|2021-04-08 12:40:26

tt3d4s|mmog6c|mmog6c|-4|   Let's talk taxes. I probably will wait till May or June to file, because the federal and state deadlines have been pushed back.  It's likely that I'll have to pay a hefty sum of taxes this year, maybe 5 digits. This is the first year that I started to thrive making short term theta gains.  1. Is there a way for me to pay taxes using an installment plan via IRS, and does it accrue interest? Wouldn't it be better to pay a large sum of taxes in small chunks so I can redeploy some of my winning plays? 2. How much tax deduction can I use without the risk of getting audited? I'm an independent contractor / self-business owner and the past few years I've used whatever I could use (business materials, training costs, gas mileage, etc). 3. Anyone here use turbotax? I've been using it the past 4 years, and this year I'm thinking that I would use the premium version for their supposed "audit defense" feature. Any experiences with that?|2021-04-08 08:27:03

tufp63|mmog6c|mmog6c|0|A little DD for you guys for a pharm company. Ticker: CTXR  They have a product called Mino-lok which has been fast tracked by the FDA. Phase 3 results are end of the month so im expecting a big jump. ATH was 5.50 currently 1.80.   Mino-Lok is an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). Mino-Lok product is intended to salvage the CVC (central venous catheter), obviating the need to remove and replace the catheter. This is a recognized unmet medical need. The drug is currently in Phase 3 clinical studies with an independent DMC (Data Monitoring Committee) interim efficacy review coming late-April/early-May. Mino-Lok has proven 100% efficacy rate in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials.   Citius Pharmaceuticals has 10.7% insider ownership, 13,457,939 shares equating to cca. $25.5 million (at a share price of $1.90), out of 125,758,091 shares outstanding  Do your own DD|2021-04-08 14:18:26
