gnxeel|w1vi3d|w1vi3d|5|Im shorting Marriot Hotels. $MAR  . Strike price is 140, puts expire in mid January. I'm using this as a hedge against market risk/recession/financial crisis. Its a small percentage of my portfolio. I'm hoping it will protect my other assets.  Marriot Hotels is highly indebted and was really shaken by the pandemic. They have a very poor Current Ratio, around 0.5 . Theoretically in a recession people will stop spending on leisure and luxury first. Monkeypox is also spreading much faster than most people realize and appears to be on the verge of getting international attention, but that's a conversation for another day.  I'm currently getting burned by revenge travel, however. Earnings come out in two weeks, and will probably look good for the company.  Am I doing this right or am I totally missing something?

gmqj45|w1vi3d|w1vi3d|5|Right now the only thing that matters is the Fed is easing relative to markets' interest rate expectations (markets currently priced 40% chance of 100bps rate hike, that needs to come down to 0%).  Yes the economy will likely be worse due to this, yes CPI is likely to hang over 9% for a few months.  Yes earnings will be crap next 2-3 quarters.  But short term none of that matters; bond markets are overpriced for rate hikes and that's fuel for a short term pump.  I've been bearish for most of this year, but I would advise against fighting this short term pump for the next couple of weeks.  Ride this short-term wave up.  Fed is easing relative to expectations, that's all that matters.|2022-07-18 06:46:44

"I'm not sure about this. Last time-"  "You will Ring the Bell."  With a heavy sigh, Cramer took the hammer in his hand, twirling it back and forth between his fingers.  "Will this...finally lift the curse?"  JPow's eyes darkened, the dying light of a thousand tortured souls swirling in his pupils for a moment. Cramer could hear their screams as their calls and puts were slowly drained.  "You will Ring the Bell."  Cramer nodded, knowing he was beholden to the curse above all else. The market would plummet and it would hang upon his head.  JPow turned to leave, wisps of gathering darkness enveloping his form as his footsteps faded into the distance.

gmqvnf|w1vi3d|w1vi3d|4|Just something to note. Panic buying is a much stronger force than panic selling. Most people assume the market goes up in long term. So you can survive a downturn, because deep down you feel the market will eventually go back up.  Panic buying is another story. You Panic buy because the market goes up long term. That means you are always running the risk that the price will never go lower than it is today. That is in the back of everyone's mind, all the time.  A lot of people timed the top to an extent. There's a ton of cash out there waiting for the perfect reentry. It could be a tsunami of buying if the market really starts going.

gn3xok|w1vi3d|w1vi3d|3|My mom wants me to manage her Roth (lol) and I was talking to her financial advisor while we initiated the process to make it self directed, and it‚Äôs beyond obvious why big tech is so over valued  I figured I‚Äôd try to glean some information from him so I respectfully started probing some questions about what they would advise my mother if I wasn‚Äôt there. He went on some nonsensical tirade about how they have mapped out infinity billion simulations of the footure to determine the optimal investments for my mom, which, obviously, just boiled down to throwing it all into the nasdaq  These people either have no idea what they‚Äôre doing or are just paralyzed by fear when handling other people‚Äôs money, because literally all any of these advisors do for these trillions of dollars in retirement accounts is throw it all into the nasdaq  I think this is going to blow up for the next 10 years. I think the nasdaq will be completely flat for 10 years and a lot of people with managed portfolios are going to be very mad and start looking into self direction|2022-07-18 08:45:06

gnf7vw|w1vi3d|w1vi3d|-3|This morning, after studying planetary movements with my telescope, I went downstairs and gave a tray of freshly baked croissants a new box of Crayola crayons. I then sacrificed a virgin retail trader on the kitchen island. I had found the boy looking longingly at Teslas at a car dealership; he didn't hesitate to get into my own Tesla after I offered him a Bitcoin. The croissants stood and folded themselves around the crayons. Then they danced and danced while I slowly sipped my Luckin Coffee. When the dance concluded, I smiled around a mouthful of croissant and blood while observing the pastries' charts. So much red. Not just the blood, but crimson, waxen jagged lines. I turned away, intent to place my daily trades, when suddenly I smelled smoke. Turning back, I saw one of the croissants engulfed in flames. I knew better than to interrupt the ceremony, and watched in wonder as the flames began to fade, and an ocean of green, hot wax spilled from under the charcoal crescent. Like a spring, it flowed without ceasing, until it had spilled across the island. Until it had pushed the less viscous blood onto the floor. Until it had covered the red jagged lines. Until the corpse of the boy looked like a symbol of newness and life.|2022-07-18 10:05:45

go64d5|w1vi3d|w1vi3d|0|What do you guys think of LVMH (Ticker: LVMHF) should they not benefit big time by a weak Euro since their main income source is the United states followed by Asia?   If they sold a LV bag for 5000 Dollars in February/March when 1,00 USD was still 0,88 Euro that was 4400 Euro in sales for LVMH. Now with 1 Euro = 1 USD selling a LV bag for 5000 Dollars in the US ends LVMH up with 5000 Euros in sales. Thats roughly a 15% increase. If we now faktor in 5% higher total production costs because of higher energy prices (production costs always have been very low compared to the prices LVMH sells their products) that would leave us with 10% higher earnings when it comes to exports from the US.|2022-07-18 13:03:41
