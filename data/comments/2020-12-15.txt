Which means in my area, there are a lot of people who literally have 0 income right now.  I live in a "luxury" apartment complex in a good part of town in the burbs of a major city. You know the type. Anyway, it's a safe part of town.  Like 2 weeks ago, we started getting an absolute fuckton of break-ins in my complex. Apartments getting ransacked, car windows being broken, etc. I grew up in the ghetto, so it doesn't scare me personally, but it's weird af to be happening here. There are like community notices and police bulletins about a massive spike in robberies, and I'm in a gay ritzy part of town. Cops strollin everywhere. And if it's happening here, it's gotta be happening everywhere.   I dunno boys. I feel like that whole "4 meals away from anarchy" thing is a real consideration. I don't know wtf the government thought would happen. Pandemic shits on the economy, shit closes down, like 1/3 of all small businesses fail, and they give us... One $1,200 check?

I just wanted to point out that the reason you're seeing fewer gain/loss robinhood charts is because we took it to heart when you got mad last week about "positions or gtfo" not being enforced and [made a bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/VisualMod/comments/) that spams all robinhood charts if they don't include position information or have a number greater than absolute value of 2,500 in them.  Once OPs get used to having to put that in the gallery you'll see more gain/losses. Sorry if there are some that don't like it but we try to listen. Is it better this way?|2020-12-15 13:12:55

fyibnb|kdjq0q|kdjq0q|15|I dont know when it's going to happen but people dont realize, especially wsb, just how bad the loan delinquency is.  If you were too look at the delinquency rates from FRED they dont actually look bad compared to a couple of years ago, it actually shows that delinquency is down from 2016.  Why is that?  Because the cares act allows the banks to stash the delinquencies related to covid in another "box" on their quarterly call reports and these amounts are confidential. . . .  > Beginning with the June 30, 2020, report date, institutions should report   the total number of loans outstanding that have been modified under Section 4013 and the outstanding   balance of these loans in Call Report Schedule RC-C, Part I, Loans and Leases, Memorandum   items 17.a and 17.b, respectively. These two items are being collected on a *confidential basis* at the   institution level.  Remember that it was loan defaults that eventually caused the crash in 07-08.|2020-12-15 14:27:23

This will likely continue for a week or two. DO NOT buy weeklies you retards, but def take advantage by getting into long positions. My favorite: CWEB (leveraged china) 2. Stop buying DIS puts you troglodytes! Do you not remember march!??! 3. TSLA call credit spreads may be a good play for those who like to go against the grain. 4. PLTR -- just buy the damn dip, fa&&ots!  At this point, best risk/reward play is go long CHINA, in particular BABA...but nothing short-dated. Oversold, way undervalued based on fundamentals and should reverse strongly.  BABA 285c 2/19s  CWEB  (3k shares)|2020-12-15 12:07:17

Back by the CIA at first now under contracts with the US Military, the FDA and the Greek Government among others... it just keep getting bigger contracts and I tried to find just one, one contract that failed and I didn’t find any... meaning when someone gets on board they stay on board...= recurring $$$   They are putting money in marketing... something they never done to get a bite at the commercial sectors which they have appliance IN EVERY SECTOR...  Is PLTR worth 30$ aka 80B today? Probably not... this is trading... stocks get ahead of themselves... however is this a 50$ or hell even a 100$ stock down a year or 2?? Hell yeah!   That beeing said... buy stocks or push your exp further down the road... stop doing weekly and loosing your shirt 🙏🏻🙏🏻  I know this is WSB but stop panicking when it dip a little...

fy6wu1|kdjq0q|kdjq0q|5|I hope someone introduces legislation allowing prisoners access to cell phones.   There will be an increase in prison population and I think it is cruel to deny social media to inmates. Perhaps an upstart company can look into providing inmates with cell phones, monitored by the prison of course, in order to have contact with family. Not only would it be humane in providing inmates access to family and social support groups and programs, but with proper monitoring it would also give the prison an upper hand against those inmate planning riots, selling weapons, or hiding illegal contraband.|2020-12-15 13:02:54
fy6xs7|kdjq0q|kdjq0q|3|LOL, VLDR down from where it was couple of hours ago because of a report that Intel’s Mobileye might develop their own LiDAR instead of using LAZR’s.

In the meantime, VLDR brought their latest LiDAR units down to $600~ or less per unit.   Separately, Mobileye plans on bringing their own autonomous vehicle by 2025.

Only problem is if it spikes a ton, your gains don’t scale after a certain point but as long as you don’t thing a dramatic spike in vol is in the cards, you should be fine.|2020-12-15 11:07:46

fxit6m|kdjq0q|kdjq0q|7|How fucking dare anyone out there make fun of Cramey after all he has been through.!  He lost his aunt, he went through a divorce. He had two fuckin kids.  His wife’s boyfriend turned out to be a user, a cheater, and now he’s going through a custody battle. All you people care about is... mad money and losing money off of him.  🗣HE’S A HUMAN!🗣 What you don't realize is that Cramey is making you all this mad money and all you do is write a bunch of crap about him.  He hasn't performed on stage in years. His show is called "Mad Money" for a reason because all you people want is MONEY! MONEY-MONEY, MONEY: MONEY!.  🗣LEAVE HIM ALONE!🗣 You are lucky he even mentioned you  🗣BASTARDS! 😭LEAVE CRAMEY ALONE!😭...Please.  WSB talked about professionalism and said if Cramey was a professional he would've made it PLTR day no matter what.  Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional to publicly bash someone who is going through a hard time.  Leave Cramey Alone Please! Leave Jim Cramey alone! Right now! I mean it!  Anyone that has a problem with him you deal with me, because he is not well right now.  LEAVE HIM ALONE!😭😭😭|2020-12-15 09:54:50

Normally, you'd think a trend like this would cause a fear spike and some sort of sell-off, but it's like greed is just through the roof, and most people refuse to sell because "stocks go up."  I really have no idea what this means for the short-term trend, tbh. But it does seem like there has to be a point where we get a big red day, right? At some point, sentiment has to get shaky. I wonder what that point is. 5 red days in a row? 6? 50?|2020-12-15 06:59:51

fy3oia|kdjq0q|kdjq0q|2|Just so you all don't plead ignorance when it happens: trump can extend the deadline for a government spending bill another few weeks. The coming deadline in all the headlines is not concrete. The politicians have no motivation to pass stimulus beyond the lives of american citizens, which we all know is the last of their concerns.  This means that the stim may not be passed until January, after the senate runoffs when everyones cards are finally dealt. Do not expect stimulus this month. Do not get your hope's up.  That being said, who knows they may pass it for shits.|2020-12-15 12:39:11

Kinda why Vale was the hottest shit in here 2 months ago, which is kinda retarded given they’re mostly in the iron ore business but wtv. Anyways, this one is a penny stock so obv more risky but huge upside potential, and it’s on a  strong run up plus bunch of favorable catalysts going for it at the moment (Fitch upgrade, secured permit & funding, rising copper prices, etc).
