Asset prices remain elevated and even edging higher because the Fed is running the entire operation, maintaining all bids. This is a process, not an event. Dimon and the lesser banks are now armed with vaults full of liquid cash ready to ride the downfall and buy up the dip when the signal is given to restart the next asset expansion program.   The ONLY thing you need to consider is (a) how many players still need to cash out and (b) how long that'll take.|2019-11-11 12:37:24

If I have a call, sell the strike one price below my long contract's strike?  2. If I have a put, sell the strike one above?  Is this correct?   Next question and likely the more important/also more stupid part of my ask:  &#x200B;  How does selling those work? I've never sold/written options before. How do I exit or "close" both positions the next day once it would no longer be considered a day trade. Do I Sell my contract and then use the funds to "buy back" (is that even possible?) the one I wrote?  &#x200B;  Sorry, I know it's dumb but I can't find a good explanation online.|2019-11-11 13:22:40

I figured it having such a limited library, how many other streaming options there are out there, and the fact that the same people who subscribe would be the same people who own DVD's of half the shit, it would be a gigantic let down.  I'm surprised to hear how many people know about it and are pumped to sign up.  Idk, ima continue streaming/pirating my shit from my phone and chrome casting it to my TV. If I got everything I wanted, I'd have 6 different apps and $100+/month in bills. That's not exactly better than cable anymore, but I guess you dont have to watch commercials....|2019-11-11 08:25:00

78cjoz|duqxq1|duqxq1|1|My thots on gold and silver. I'm hoping for a bounce back which is possible if we get bad hong kong or china news. If not we could hit 1400 and hopefully stabilize there. Guess the feds actions were priced in at 1500. We have 12.5 trillion negative yielding debt instead of 17 now. But we have not QE and repo with the feds balance sheet expanding everyday. I'm pretty confident in my 2021 calls and semi confident in some 17 slv march 2020 calls. If warran makes it for dem candidate we could see a nice jump. Realistically though we prob wont see another run up will we get bad data or trade news which forces J Pow to change his wording at one of his gay speeches. I'm thinking by spring he ll change his toon cause there will be 4-6 angry trump tweets directed at him by then and he dont like making mango mad|2019-11-11 10:42:51
