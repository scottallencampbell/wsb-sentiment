Asset prices remain elevated and even edging higher because the Fed is running the entire operation, maintaining all bids. This is a process, not an event. Dimon and the lesser banks are now armed with vaults full of liquid cash ready to ride the downfall and buy up the dip when the signal is given to restart the next asset expansion program.

If I have a call, sell the strike one price below my long contract's strike?  2. If I have a put, sell the strike one above?  Is this correct?   Next question and likely the more important/also more stupid part of my ask:  &#x200B;  How does selling those work? I've never sold/written options before. How do I exit or "close" both positions the next day once it would no longer be considered a day trade. Do I Sell my contract and then use the funds to "buy back" (is that even possible?) the one I wrote?  &#x200B;  Sorry, I know it's dumb but I can't find a good explanation online.|2019-11-11 13:22:40

I'm surprised to hear how many people know about it and are pumped to sign up.  Idk, ima continue streaming/pirating my shit from my phone and chrome casting it to my TV.

78cjoz|duqxq1|duqxq1|1|My thots on gold and silver. I'm hoping for a bounce back which is possible if we get bad hong kong or china news. If not we could hit 1400 and hopefully stabilize there. Guess the feds actions were priced in at 1500. We have 12.5 trillion negative yielding debt instead of 17 now. But we have not QE and repo with the feds balance sheet expanding everyday. I'm pretty confident in my 2021 calls and semi confident in some 17 slv march 2020 calls. If warran makes it for dem candidate we could see a nice jump. Realistically though we prob wont see another run up will we get bad data or trade news which forces J Pow to change his wording at one of his gay speeches.

They'll just keep it in this range for as long as it takes to unwind positions. Then one day out of nowhere, we drill|2019-11-11 15:05:51

792vdx|duqxq1|duqxq1|-1|All right sold some puts at strike $13 for $1.00. I‚Äôve read that a lot of the uncertainty comes from the fact that they used mineral water as a placebo in their studies, and the experimental groups had a higher elevation of palpitations and such. WS expects FDA approvals but I see some room for uncertainty.  Still.. $13 is a 1 year low... seems like a fair insurance bet.  Edit: 1 year low|2019-11-11 13:50:44

It's just a bunch of children who have once watched a video about a 4chan post, and who are now living out their dream of having lots of money on this sub, right? Because that's how most people here seem to talk. And the ones who sound serious are just really good roleplayers?|2019-11-11 07:55:22
