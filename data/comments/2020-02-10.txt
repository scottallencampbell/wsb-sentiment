The rumor is, rich people at the top of the mountain will pay a thousand dollars for a delivered refridgerator.  But they can't get it up there by themselves.

h7vznx|f1osqm|f1osqm|7|Virus getting out of control now, legit plague inc. British goes to Singapore and gets infected by Singaporeans who had been in China. Flies to ski resort in France. 6 Brits at french ski resort get infected, 5 go back to Britain, likely infecting more people, the other goes to Spain, again likely infecting more people. We already at the *least* have 3 person to person chain of infections, if those Brits got anyone else infected then it's up to 4. More importantly Singapore had already locked down on flights coming from China, so their preventative measures have been ineffective.  Edit: Since people want to be retarded about this, yes, I realize this is not the most deadly virus in the world. Thing is with it spreading this much it will reach people who can die from it. Almost 800 people have died already. People are gonna say, "but the flu kills so many more" yes but these are not mutually exclusive things, these are more bodies on top of the pile, more people dead. A plane goes down with 200 on board and it's a tragedy, a virus kills 800 and it's a shitty flu.|2020-02-10 08:49:24

h89e0i|f1osqm|f1osqm|6|Call me boring and tell me that I don't belong as I do no options, but today my portfolio of 13 different individual stonks surpassed net liquidation value of €50k for the first time and I'm writing this comment as a little celebration.  I started a bit over 3 years ago with €20k and added €200 monthly (I'm only a student). After a few months I thought that things were not moving fast enough so I bought stonks worth €16k on margin (2.5% interest). Since then my monthly contribution + dividends have decreased my margin loan down to €7.8k. I'm hoping that I can pay it off before the end of next year by finishing with studying and doing some actual work for once.   Seeing the value climb past €50k for the first time was a cool feeling. €100k is kind of my big goal and I'm now closer to that than to 0.   Shoutout to Interactive Brokers for their low commisions and to Nvidia, Airbus, Microsoft and Realty Income for carrying the performance of my portfolio.|2020-02-10 11:14:59

h8qxpu|f1osqm|f1osqm|-1|Noob question. I bought a MSFT call this morning. Strike of $185 with a premium of $2.27.  As of this writing, MSFT is as $187.67 which is 40 cents over my breakeven.  My question is this, in Robinhood, it shows my option is worth $4.03/ share. So I could sell it for a $176 profit.  But if I exercised the option, I'd only profit $40. Is that correct?  Also - does this mean that if I held the option through expiry and nothing changed, I'd only profit $40 instead of the $176? So in this case I'd end up losing potential profit?  Thanks.|2020-02-10 14:12:23

h7njc9|f1osqm|f1osqm|0| *Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, for they are in rhythm only if timing is good. Timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts, shooting bows and guns, and riding horses. In all skills and abilities there is timing.... There is timing in the whole life of the warrior, in his thriving and declining, in his harmony and discord. Similarly, there is timing in the Way of the merchant, in the rise and fall of capital. All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to discern this. In strategy there are various timing considerations. From the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing, and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing, first seeing the distance timing and the background timing. This is the main thing in strategy. It is especially important to know the background timing, otherwise your strategy will become uncertain.* \- The book of five rings (Japan 17th century)     Even the Japanese figured out in the 17th century you SHOULD TIME THE MARKET and not be a retard buy and hold investor     TIMING IS EVERYTHING|2020-02-10 06:52:59

h8lvi6|f1osqm|f1osqm|-7|It looks like my site is offering a strike rate of 210 for April 17 at $1.62... now what exactly does that $1.62 mean. If I change my strike rate and the date, then that $ value changes accordingly. What does that $1.62 represent? At the bottom it says Quantity and I have chosen 1.   How much is the maximum I can lose on this? How much money will I make If MSFT goes up to like 200 by next month? Any insight is appreciated|2020-02-10 13:21:40
