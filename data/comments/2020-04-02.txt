m9bskp|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|21|From "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"  > "Not even a world war can keep the stock market from being a bull market when conditions are bullish, or a bear market when conditions are bearish. And all a man needs to know to make money is to appraise conditions."  [...]  >"You will find in actual practice that if you trade as I have indicated any important piece of news given out between the closing of one market and the opening of another is usually in harmony with the line of least resistance. The trend has been established before the news is published, and in bull markets bear items are ignored and bull news exaggerated, and vice versa."  [...]  > "It sounds very easy to say that all you have to do is to watch the tape, establish your resistance points and be ready to trade along the line of least resistance as soon as you have determined it. But in actual practice a man has to guard against many things, and most of all against himself that is, against human nature. That is the reason why I say that the man who is right always has two forces working in his favor basic conditions and the men who are wrong. In a bull market bear factors are ignored. That is human nature, and yet human beings profess astonishment at it."|2020-04-02 17:12:33

m92a7e|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|17|It‚Äôs pretty clear the market is trading on fear, hope and Fed manipulation.   We rallied in the AM on a Trump tweet and in the PM on a huge JPow buy. Everything else was red.   Whether it‚Äôs tomorrow or next week, we will see the bill come due for 10 million new unemployment claims in 2 weeks. If you think this number isn‚Äôt remarkable, you are retarded. If it doesn‚Äôt level off in the next week or 2, our economy is going to be broken for the foreseeable future. Rehiring won‚Äôt happen anywhere as fast as the layoffs, and no one talks about it but the global supply chain is *fucked.*  I think the fall will start tomorrow or Monday, after the high of the oil pump wears off and once investors start to process the news we will see a sell off.   They‚Äôre not pumping trillions into the market to bring it back to ATH, they‚Äôre pumping it up *so the DOW doesn‚Äôt fall to 5,000 this year.*|2020-04-02 15:46:01

m8fn6g|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|12|‚ÄúThis is a liquidity and momentum driven market. It‚Äôs been that way for the past four months where the correlation between the S&P 500 and the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet has expanded to a 95% relationship. This is a case of a very accommodative Fed policy. The double-digit growth in the money supply is bypassing the real economy and has entered into asset markets broadly, and specifically into equities. So as long as the Fed is in the game priming the monetary pump, shorting stocks is going to be a very dangerous game to play‚Ä¶.  The power of the Fed has become so acute that it has replaced the economy as a principle influence over the stock market to the point where there is only a 7% correlation between GDP and the S&P 500. Historically, in any given cycle that relationship was anywhere between 30% and 70%.‚Äù -‚ÄúDavid Rosenberg Warns ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Going To Have Helicopter Money‚Äù, Zero Hedge.

Crowding out effect means infinite QE will cause housing crisis at the same time as credit crisis and unemployment crisis.  If you think stimulus package can offset this, I got a bridge to sell you.   Market is so far removed from reality, 0% interest rates mean no brakes on car, infinite QE means crowding out effect is going to crush avg Joe. Now consider 45 days likely to change into 4 months and then fall Covid hits.  So many hilariously obvious warning bells going off, and everyone is just like, 10m jobless... pffft, we got a stimulus package!  Like people don't even understand that the liquidity solution walks us right into a solvency crisis.  All this is doing is pushing the eventual floor lower. US senators were selling all their stocks ahead of the actual fall, but its DEFINITELY not happening now. No way they would do that to us, they care about us.

m7zuti|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|11|I just rolled my 125 contracts of 4/24 SPY $220's into 59 contracts of 4/24 SPY $240p's. I took about a 30% haircut on the movement from my entry (roughly $27K).   Rationale for making the trade: Markets continue to respond to news irrationally,  but this can't continue indefinitely. I anticipate the downward movement over the next 3 weeks to be violent, but might only take us back to our previous low, and maybe not much past it.   As such, for me to profit from the first part of the upcoming leg down, I had to raise my strike.  If I can close these with SPY = $220 in 3 weeks, that will be a 130% gain on this new position, and a 52% gain on the amount that I originally put into the $220p (even after accounting for the losses from rolling up).|2020-04-02 10:08:17

Trump says they're cutting production by 15 mil barrels, but doesn't say the time frame.  To assume he meant per day means they're going to cut their production in half without any concessions by the US.

Every company is playing 'every man for himself' and if the US consumer begins to show weakness in the month of April, then the US economy collapses what was left of it at the end of Q4 2019.  2) No fucking way OPEC+ trims 10+ million barrels. While it might seem like a battle between SA and Russia, the preeminent threat is US shale. No way they ate their losses these past few weeks just to bail out the shale companies on the verge of bankruptcy. *Also, their original dispute was over 1.5M barrels!*  3) US shale companies likely to start going bankrupt in the next couple of months|2020-04-02 11:53:00

Analysts expect somewhere around 80k deliveries, revised down from 100k expected before COVID.  All other auto players reported major losses for Q1 and specifically March this week, so its not a stretch to think that Tesla could fall way under analyst expections.   It would also be foolish for the company to not update their guidance during the announcement of deliveries, for 2020 (Back in Jan - "Tesla said it expects 2020 vehicle deliveries **‚Äúshould comfortably exceed 500,000 units.‚Äù**)|2020-04-02 12:52:04

m7hxe1|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|11|If there's one thing that makes me consistently think that the bear trend will last at least a couple months, it's the 1918 Spanish Flu graphs which show most cities experiencing second waves after relaxing their social distancing requirements.  I just don't see how the US avoids second waves of coronavirus in the summer or fall in major cities without a fully enforced 4-6 month shutdown of activity through July/August.  Right now, most states are on different peak schedules for coronavirus.  You have states like Texas/Florida/Mississippi/Tennessee that are taking action very late in the game to try to mitigate this and so their coronavirus peaks may not occur until late May while other states start to peak in April.  So how realistic is it that we actually keep the nation shut down to squash this everywhere? Highly unlikely given the 50 states are running their own shutdown schedules.  We all know that when most cities get to the other side of their curve and new cases/deaths are declining, there will be a lot of talk of opening businesses and such.   But that's why I don't think the market can start any sort of quick v-shaped recovery here; even when new coronavirus cases/deaths start going down, the second we see case numbers start to grow again, the second waves will already have started and markets are likely to selloff again.|2020-04-02 06:40:14

m8qiph|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|3|Some thoughts.  Honestly am looking at tomorrow as a huge day whether we go up or down. It could really be a ball breaker either way. Perhaps a large move?  SBA is going to start taking all these applications for loaning money. I‚Äôm looking at the Federal Reserve / Treasury make a move to get this shit together.  If they can pull through and get people their money I think that‚Äôs what people care about. Businesses are dying for cash and if they can get those loans it‚Äôd really mean a lot for people.  But these so much uncertainty how they get the money to people.  If they whiff it tomorrow, people are gonna be very pessimistic for future and financials are going to fucking die.  On the flip side?

The bank on Thursday cut its year-end target on the S&P 500 to 2,600 from 3,100, which would translate into a nearly 20% loss for the full-year 2020. The new outlook represents the most bearish view on Wall Street, according to the CNBC Market Strategist Survey that rounds up 16 top strategists‚Äô forecasts. ‚ÄúAmid the COVID-19 crisis, instead of a V-shaped recovery, we see risks that a lack of a synchronized health care response nationally results in weakened economic activity that drags out into 2H,‚Äù Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America, said in a note Thursday.|2020-04-02 10:28:26

m825l9|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|9|" Do we need to go that way back? Just look at the 2008-2009. It started in September after the Lehman Brothers collapse, had several mini false bottoms, each time brief rallies followed by big sell offs. The last one of those bottoms false bottoms reached on Nov 20, just a week before Thanksgiving day after two days of back to back 10+% drops, taking Nasdaq to around 1400. Then rallied until Jan 15, about 25%, only to start another round of vicious selling to start that ended in Early March, taking Nasdaq to around 11,500. That was the true bottom and has been going up pretty much on a straight line since then.   The Nasdaq index is still more than 6x of what it was then as it stands now. The economy has been largely stagnant for the past decade though. Many high paying jobs disappeared. But, one good thing is no inflation. This crisis is a much bigger crisis than any one in the past including 2008 or the 2000 dotcom bubble bust. I would not be surprised if Nasdaq goes down to around 2000, S&P to around 1000-1200 by the end of the year. That would be still roughly 100% higher than what they were at the bottom of the last bear market in March 2009, not bad for 11 years. Doubling up money in 11 years in an anemic economy and going through a world war like event like this one is remarkable actually.   I do not understand who buys stock at this levels even without this virus? It was pumped up by the government by easy money, which is about to run out. Once they run out of tools to pump up, then the real market will appear, if the real market reflects the real economy, the current prices is not justified. "|2020-04-02 10:29:33

m8n1zn|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|11|Edit: I‚Äôve had to change my price because of all the demand. They are now 2$ each, sorry guys. This is still a steal.   Guys I have an excellent deal for you. As UBER plummets this is your chance to really make some incredible profits and I have exactly what you need to accomplish that. I am letting 23 contracts of 4/3 11p go for only $23. I originally paid $575 so you are getting the absolute steal of a lifetime because I‚Äôm selling these for only $1 a contract. Twenty three dollars for all twenty three contracts. You will not find a better deal. Just go ahead and log on to Robinhood, find UBER 4/3 11p, and enter a limit price of $0.02 and your order will fill. You will be absolutely rolling in tendies by eod. Go ahead and BUY NOW!|2020-04-02 13:32:34

Don‚Äôt fucking ask me any shitty questions‚Äì I‚Äôm not your fucking financial advisor. Grow a pair and stick to a position, then hold it.  I got in on TXT Calls at $40 expiring on 06/19/20 before market close. I had a feeling Trump would announce some sort of military move in order to pump the market. Now that the US will be deploying troops to Venezuela, it‚Äôs a good time to get in on defense calls, especially considering the fact that the U.S. defense companies are still actively winning contracts despite the fact that many factories are shut down.   Textron is a direct competitor of Lockheed. Why not options on Lockheed instead of Textron? Well, your mom‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs wallet can‚Äôt afford a call option on Lockheed. Also, Textron volume is on the rise. Additionally, whenever BA and other defense stocks rise, Textron rises proportionately given the fact that they still have active contracts with the U.S.  Currently, Lockheed and Textron are battling for several Air contracts. Combined with the fact that Textron will be able to maintain a revenue stream as well as the fact that the military industry complex is deemed an essential business and will soon be up and running far before and quicker than any retail stock possibly can, getting in on a TXT call early on is a gold opportunity.

m81kfv|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|3|Late morning thoughts - The reactions to the bad unemployment numbers in the premarket, and the retard rally off the Trump Tweet (when was the last time we saw a Trump Tweet move markets that much?) tells the story; Neither bulls, nor bears, have given up. Today, and tomorrow will be crucial to determine the overall direction of the market going forward.  Closing above $251.44 today would be extremely bullish and would likely take us up to retest the highs at $263-$264.  Closing in the $250-$244 range is the battleground, but favors the bears slightly.  Closing below $244, particularly if that were to happen today, would be extremely bearish.  Unless we see bulls completely roll over, like they did on the move from $290 to $250 a few weeks ago, we will not see new lows any time soon.|2020-04-02 10:24:09

Its role was analogous to the American Apollo Lunar Module (LM). Several LK modules were flown without crew in Earth orbit, but no LK ever reached the Moon. The development of the N1 launch vehicle required for the Moon flight suffered setbacks (including several launch failures), and the first Moon landings were achieved by US astronauts. As a result, both the N1 and the LK programs were cancelled without any further development. "  &#x200B;  Please contact me for more info.|2020-04-02 08:06:53

m8kvk8|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|0|So it looks like we had a fractal develop as expected, except it's heavily skewed to the right. You tend to get Elliott wave fractals when markets are volatile with a sharp divergence in bear/bull opinion, as each side sorta takes turns buying and selling in waves.  The fractal itself that is being produced has a heavy downward /right skew which indicates bears have more momentum than bulls. The fractal itself, if it completes, will likely have one more upward leg before completing at the old floor.  Bear momentum should accelerate and reach peak AFTER the next up leg. My bet is that traders riding the waves  SUPER SLAM through current floor. In fact, it's possible that we skip the bull phase and that the current down leg in fact challenges support, with the next downleg finding a new floor.  IF things play out, we should actually have one more major bull phase after the things I've mentioned. Then bears should take control for 9000 power superslam down to the center of the earth at max momentum. This is likely to be the final floor for quite a while, if this happens.  This is all just looking at Elliott wave theory, and if things continue to play out the way they have recently.|2020-04-02 13:13:41

I know at my business, we plan on bringing people back before June to claim them on the PPP and also to conserve our current cash. We'll be 100% operational once this virus is over.

That‚Äôs when you buy long term puts because the virus will probably come back. People will panic, and then we will have pain again.

m93hro|ftkgj6|ftkgj6|-1|VIX seems to have peaked so I‚Äôd assume the worst plunge is behind. Still, volatility doesn‚Äôt climb this high and just suddenly fall linearly, it‚Äôs based on derivatives. Just because it‚Äôs peaked doesn‚Äôt mean everything‚Äôs all good now.  For ex. Covid‚Äôs rate of spread is growing faster than last month‚Äôs, but proportionally less than for 1mo vs 2mo‚Äôs difference. ie it‚Äôs acceleration rate is slowing down, but it‚Äôs still accelerating and it‚Äôs not at the apex yet. That‚Äôs how volatility seems to be operating. We‚Äôre not at the bottom, but last month was the steepest leg down we‚Äôll take.   At least that‚Äôs my wager|2020-04-02 15:56:55
