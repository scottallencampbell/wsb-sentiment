Picked up 11/25 192.50c mid afternoon yesterday. Yes, I went too far otm. At open they were up over 40% and in the space of time between bell & my thumbs filling out a limit order, the price dropped & the order didn't fill. Chased it down for about five minutes, got sick of it and kept a limit for 20% profit set. Figured, the news was great - they beat earnings, it'll go back up....

Several hours later.... (SpongeBob narrator voice)

The contracts are down almost 30% and the current strike is one dollar higher than when I bought... Completely IV fucked. I am holding through to Monday at least.

The can has been kicked down the road. If you're gonna buy puts, buy short term at serious resistance levels (387, 390, 400) or buy 2023 debit spreads.

Market has hardcore anxiety, and reasonably so right now, and saw Amazon and shit the bed. But Amazon beat earnings, and missed revenue by less than like half a percent.

Their 4th quarter forecast is what scared people because it was significantly lower than analysts forecasts..... But it was also still significantly higher than 3q earnings.

That basically means, Amazon was probably already trading at or close to its legitimate fair market value under current market conditions. It dropped 20 percent in AH. That's just not an accurate reflection of the information that was reported.

Today, the market is course correcting its own anxious overreaction to what was an overall decent earnings week considering the current market conditions. (Overall decent except meta.

“Early this morning, an assailant broke into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco and violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi.  The assailant is in custody and the motivation for the attack is under investigation.  Mr. Pelosi was taken to the hospital, where he is receiving excellent medical care and is expected to make a full recovery.  The Speaker was not in San Francisco at the time.

You can literally go, online, for free. See the buy wall at 20,500 right now. Prior weeks you could see buy walls at 19k and 19.5k.

You can literally see this week the buy wall at 20.5k lifted as soon as the NYSE trading hours close, and put back up 30 minutes before.

Yet even with 4 months now of range bound activity with fucking crystal clear buy/sell walls. 

Motherfucks still went 580M short for BTC to close below 19k last week.

Airlines are reporting increased demand in Q3, rentalcars did better than expected as well in Q3.

I know forward projection is hard here; but if people are traveling they are staying somewhere. Hotels had strong Q3.

Why the fuck would you bet Airbnb will not? 

I get there has been some circulating stories about Airbnb groups starting to panic at demand drop off. I don't want to confuse with you too much math, but that is outside the date range of Q3.

MC5 for example made this one of their own (and if you are into rock or punk you like a band influenced by MC5 can almost guarantee).  Can be pretty neat if follow influences of your favorite artists back 60+ years.  Jerry probably influenced indirectly nearly as many artists as Johnny Cash did.

You have under 2 weeks left to exit all your underlines. All underlines will start falling fast around the second week of November. That is what my chart indicates, but it could be sooner.



I expect SPY will hit above 385 one more time in the next 3 business days, which is before the FOMC meeting and Labor Market data report. I will close all my bullish positions then.



According to my chart, for SPY:

Bottom shoulder = $260 around 1/6/2023

Bottom head (final bottom) = $210 around 5/26/2023|2022-10-28 11:01:29u4yuhu|yfjz8z|yfjz8z|1|Wait for 388-390 for the confident short|2022-10-28 11:13:23u51sj7|yfjz8z|yfjz8z|1|Elon took Twot

*One thing that separates fledgling investors from the pros is reading financial statements. If you want to become a better investor, make like a pro and digest the financials.*   
  
*I asked my team to help club members understand how to analyze an earnings report like a pro. CNBC Investing Club Portfolio Analyst Zev Fima put together a five-part series to help Club members better understand all the tables and charts and how to analyze them.*  
   
*It’s the best way to truly understand a company’s performance. With earnings season now fully underway, we know this resource will help club members invest smarter after companies report their earnings.*  
   
*Subscribe to my Investing Club for access to this learning tool, and become a better investor today!*  
  
So, at what point in this club do you take peoples money, tell them to buy lots of Meta and NVIDIA, and Bausch Healthcare and then cry like a a beech when everyone sees you are a fraud.
