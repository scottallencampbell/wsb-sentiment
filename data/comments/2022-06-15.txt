Now to smoke a little ![img](emotet5_2th526880), I think anyone who is doing layoffs and hiring freeze right now are going to be best positioned for the rebound in 1-2 years. Look to large companies with solid books if youre risk adverse. You can roll the dice on small companies, but its seriously a crapshoot right now. I expect 1-2 market leaders to emerge in new sectors like fintech, biotech, and edge computing...its defnitly going to cut down the froth.

chao6r|vcqzky|vcqzky|9|ELI5:  Why stonks rally on bad bear news?  - Relief because its not as bad as expected. - MM slams money into market to create liquidity. - Sell the news:  when the market emotionally sells, then Hedge buys, it creates a quick squeeze, forcing put holders to quickly capitulate. - People expect it. - High Frequency Algos dont rely on anything but short to mid term TA to trade.  If they get into a bidding war with each other, they will raise prices for long enough for human players to enter. - Day traders often time the market, and can sit in from anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 hours. - Fundamentals are second to sentiment. - Equity markets are derivative and partially uncoupled from real-world events.|2022-06-15 12:38:37

Suits like that are miserable in a DC summer. A few less trips to the steak house will improve our supply of beef, and tighten expectations. This is a very healthy thing to be happening.

chms5q|vcqzky|vcqzky|6|Here's some good info for you apes. Options prices track with IV, and can also be considered a "future" on stock prices. When there is a lot of uncertainty ("will it be 50bp or 75? Will they have a bullish/bearish/hawkish read on X?") about a particular FOMC/presidential policy address/etc. IV on options will be high across the board. When there is news that clears up some of that uncertainty, IV will get crushed, the same as earnings. This reduces short interest in particular, and can result in hedges closing to rebalance until further data comes in.  This is, again, very evident when there is a lot of stock market volatility - you have periods where there is intense selling, then a bottom forms as uncertainty dissipates, then there is more uncertainty or strife emerges and selling begins again. Otherwise, if volatility remains low, stocks will sort of just do their normal SOGU thing|2022-06-15 14:00:33

Then we have the supply of unfinished, incomplete homes due to supply shortages choking supply. If you're a first time homeowner, you need to stop thinking you deserve to live in a home.

cgtzco|vcqzky|vcqzky|9|I could write this retard's speech in like 2 minutes if they just fill in the blank.  Good afternoon,  At the Federal Reserve we are strongly committed to the two mandates set out by Congress: maximum employment and price stability.  Today, in support of those goals, the FOMC has determined that it is time to ----------  I want to reiterate that we at the Federal Reserve are data dependent and have access to the full range of tools to accomplish these mandates. Because the economy is very strong, and in light of historically tight labor markets, we feel confident that this action  is appropriate.  We understand that inflation poses significant hardship, particularly for those who have the least and rely on predictable prices, including affordable food and housing. Our monetary policies are fully directed to bring inflation to an appropriate long term average rate of two percent.   Etc.|2022-06-15 10:45:19

cgofx5|vcqzky|vcqzky|6|I'll admit there's a chance of some BS green dildos come 2 o'clock. However, it's very unlikely. In any scenario above .5 (and you better believe all the way up to 1.0 is on the table), it's a selloff. Almost 100%. If it's still .5, there's still a great chance for a selloff, because 1. It's still a rate hike, QT, and don't fight the Fed who will be clearly reiterating their hawkish position and 2. They won't be doing enough to fight inflation, so the markets will expect inflation to run higher and higher rate hikes down the road  Basically, a lose/lose situation in my opinion. Remember from March 2020 for like 18 months how any news good or bad was an immediate pump? Well now it's the opposite. Your time is over bulls, the year of the bear is here!|2022-06-15 10:07:13

cfzf0y|vcqzky|vcqzky|4|Here’s my plan today (disclaimer: I’m retarded). Im not expecting much movement after 1030. I could be wrong, but I’m expecting to trade sideways more or less into fomc. So I’m not opening any 0dtes early so theta can eat away at them. Going into the fomc is going to be interesting. We have the hike itself and THEN we have the feds giving guidance, and the guidance is going to be real important. Everybody thinks they know what’s going to happen for each potential rate hike scenario. Those people don’t know shit. I will wait until we get a solid trend before I open anything today. If we lose 370, we’re going to leg down again. If we rally and break 382, we’re likely gapping up back to 390 eow. Anyone who says they know how the market will react is a liar. 50 bps bullish? Could be bearish if the feds aren’t tightening and doing their job. 100 bps bearish? MMS might find it bullish the fed is bringing the hammer down. Wait for the trend and follow it and just know: we lose 370, we are going down. If we break 382, I’ll be buying 390 calls expiring Friday. Good luck yall|2022-06-15 06:42:32

The messaging is at odds with the White House’s prior focus on reducing the U.S. fossil fuel output.  I voted for Biden, because I would sooner castrate myself with a rusty butter knife than vote R.   But this is a fucking clown show.   The Ukraine war only exacerbated an already-bad situation.  And while producers and refiners are ultimately responsible, of course they don't want to invest in capex when the writing is on the wall vis-a-vis fossil fuels.  If you owned a business, would you want to invest in building something that the world is actively working to make obsolete?   I mean that's not just a US problem, but a global problem.  There is absolutely nothing Biden can do to impact this situation.|2022-06-15 07:51:35

cgorsc|vcqzky|vcqzky|4|After the drop on Friday and Monday, basically pricing in a 75 bps increase, markets could easily trade sideways for the next week or two, screwing everyone's options. A short rally could follow either 50 bps or 75 bps, as the latter would give confidence the fed is more serious about tackling inflation. I still think 50 is more likely in order to show a steady hand, prevent panic, and avoid a tacit admission of not having moved fast enough.|2022-06-15 10:09:32

We need the service sector to burn because those fuckers want too many dollars per hour and want to pretend they're middle class. Seriously, my Big Mac was $10 yesterday.

cgmo65|vcqzky|vcqzky|3|by my calculations, if mr jerome powell, fed chairman raises rates by 100 basis points then uhh that number is bigger than 50 and something more would happen and uhh people buy less stuff cause uhh theyh need the money for bigger purchases but prices go down but they buy less stuff? yea something like that.|2022-06-15 09:54:56

Heavier than water, hard to refine.  Disregarding political hurdles, would take years to increase pumping/refining enough to really matter, and no one is investing that much.

ch0t9l|vcqzky|vcqzky|3|here's why i think we pump today after FED. market knows that demand is already starting to cool, but its slow to show up in the numbers. the .75 hike is going to slam the brakes even harder, so there is a good chance in the next two meetings prices are going to be printing much lower, surprising on the downside. at that point, there is a chance the FED starts to back off a bit.  longer term, we are going way lower than we are now. H2 layoffs and unemployment are absolutely going to start spiking. fate has been decided there IMO. but this is down the road yet so in the meantime we are going to SPY 420+|2022-06-15 11:31:35

Yes they're serious about fighting inflation, but economy is not going to be able to handle 3.8% in 2023.  They're bringing the hammer down on the economy.

The question is how fast market rates and especially 10yr T-bond yield will be higher than yearly inflation, because that will signal that fed really doesn’t need to hike anymore, but don’t expect it to happen until next year!!!|2022-06-15 13:43:36

chior1|vcqzky|vcqzky|2|Ignoring markets for a second. Anyone else think that interest rates are the wrong tool for inflation at the moment?    We have a war with an oil producing country. And the worlds factory - China, has basically shut shop for months.   Inflation isn’t being caused by economies running hot, instead it is literally the supply of goods and energy. Even basket case economies are facing similar high inflation.  Rising interest rates increases costs for capital-intensive industries such as, you guessed it oil production and manufacturing - the current drivers of high inflation.   Just worry this approach will really just cause the economy to contract severely.   I wonder if we will look back one day and consider this 1950s approach to supply constrained inflation a mistake|2022-06-15 13:32:46

cg9ntz|vcqzky|vcqzky|1|Yo recession lovers.   What kind of gdp decline are you expecting if you’re right?  The fact of the matters is that the US had a small contraction in the only GDP data released thus far. The world bank is expecting a gdp increase in 2022 both US and worldwide albeit a little lower increase than previously thought.   Another fact of the matter is that GDP is still way higher than in 2019 at worst in pandemic times it was down around 2017 levels. Equity markets although tech was a huge bubble many companies has gone back to 2012 levels and worse some still sit at 2020 levels or 2021. Oil stocks are with inflation at ath.   Like what the hell are you pricing in and for how many years?  The Buffet indicator clearly showed US equity to be in a bubble 2020-21. Some companies obviously still are but in market breadth most isn’t!   So even if you’re right that June GDP report would constitute a recession further from last contraction what is your expectations when the shock of 2020 only sent Numbers back to 2017 levels?  Obviously you can smash companies with extreme multiples all you want, that happens every day, every year! But at some point you have to realize shit most of the unpopular companies are fucking dirt cheap!   I am obviously not talking about mega caps of half a trillion or more that indices weigh their valuation weight on! (Except Dow Jones that doesn’t take market cap into account but a very different model of index weight per share price).  Anyways on many of you it sounds like gdp levels would go below that of 2017 when the pandemic couldn’t do it! What’s your thinking there?|2022-06-15 08:17:22

cfrzef|vcqzky|vcqzky|-4|When EU raises rates, Italy cannot print more money because they don’t control the money supply. So they’re going to be forced to borrow to stay afloat with foreign oil not from Russia which will cause them to default like Greece did. Normally a country can print more money and sure their currency devalues but the only bad outcome is foreign investors get iffy about their bonds and there is is inflation. But Italy cannot, this is the biggest flaw of Euro. This is Putin’s plan to destabilize Europe and send them into chaos and he can finally make his final move on Maldova and Ukraine. EU recession will also cause US to feel more pain and it’s his plan to destroy Biden and restore Russia friendly GOP|2022-06-15 05:13:05

ch2q89|vcqzky|vcqzky|-2|OK, real talk -  Jerome Powell was always more like Biden than Trump. He's going to go for a middle of the road approach.  75 basis points, which was a surprise (a few days ago) because of the high inflation numbers last friday, but basically leaked out early and tanked the market back to the last local bottom.  We will get a rally, because the 75bps will be confirmation Powell has a little more balls than the general pop was giving him credit for. It's a late minute decision, which is uncharacteristic for the Fed.  One of the extreme sides is saying we need 100bps to 'rip the bandaid,' but the truth is the high inflation is a mix of transitory and real. It's not all transitory, but it's not all real. Some of it is greedlfation, whether you want to believe it or not. So 75bps will be the right move. They're gonna wait another month or two, and if logistics companies and the greediest of producers don't stop inflating their prices, there are going to be more Biden speeches and other gov't measures to curb that shit besides the Fed.|2022-06-15 11:44:32

Amazon is clearly a solid mainstay of American culture and they sell a lot more stuff than Tesla who is $700.  It is clear what this means.  The market has over reacted in the panic and doesn't understand what is going on.  Calls for Amazon to go back to just $200 by next year are only a dollar right now!  Brilliant!  Buy now!

We need to chase price stability because the law says so, and the only way we can do that is using the tools to drop money supply so businesses can't make payroll and fire some people and drop that demand.|2022-06-15 14:24:07

chb18p|vcqzky|vcqzky|-4|What is the Fed? *So what is the Fed?* __What is the Fed?__ ***What is the Fed?***  The Federal Reserve, often referred to as the Fed, is the central bank of the United States. Congress created the Fed in 1913 to help promote a safe and sound monetary and financial system for our nation. The Fed includes the Board of Governors in Washington D.C. which has 7 members including the Chairman and Vice Chairman. All of the members of the board are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.   The Fed also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks located in cities throughout the country. The reserve banks serve as the Central Bank's operating arms and also gather economic information from all over the country to help the Fed both monitor the economy and get the broad input necessary to develop and implement effective U.S. monetary policy.   Today, the Fed performs a number of important functions, all with the ultimate goal of promoting a healthy U.S. economy. One of the Fed's most recognizable functions is conducting U.S. monetary policy which involves influencing interest rates and the availability of money and credit in our economy.  Congress has tasked the Fed with implementing monetary policies that promote maximum employment and stable prices. High levels of employment provide people with more economic opportunities and stable prices promote growth by making it easier for households and businesses to plan for the future.   Monetary policy decisions at the Fed are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, which includes all 7 members of the Board of Governors and Presidents from the Reserve Banks. This committee meets regularly to assess the conditions and outlook for the economy.  In addition to conducting monetary policy, the Federal Reserve also helps to supervise and regulate the nation's banks and works to promote a stable financial system for consumers, communities, and businesses. The Fed also works with communities, nonprofit organizations, and others across the nation to address housing problems, promote equal access to credit, and advance economic and community development.  The Fed also promotes stability in the financial system because instability in the financial system can pose a severe threat to the broader economy and communities across the nation. The Fed also acts as a bank to other banks by clearing checks, making electronic payments, and providing the currency that Americans need and use everyday.   Our nation's economy and financial system faces constant challenges. The Fed is working every day to address those challenges and is committed to helping foster good economic conditions and outcomes, employment opportunities, stable prices, and financial stability that benefit all Americans!  AND WE ARE ALSO THE FED.  To learn more about the Federal Reserve, you'll find a wide range of resources on the Board of Governors website at federalreserve.gov.|2022-06-15 12:41:03
