sxqeqr|mh2ryh|mh2ryh|13|President Joe Biden has unveiled an outline of his infrastructure plan, and it includes a proposed $174 billion investment in electric vehicles.  The Biden administration has released an outline of its infrastructure plan on its website.  It includes a $174 billion investment in electric vehicles that they summarized:  >*‚ÄúCreate good jobs electrifying vehicles. U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. He is proposing a $174 billion investment to win the EV market. His plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories to compete globally, and support American workers to make batteries and EVs. It will give consumers point of sale rebates and tax incentives to buy American-made EVs, while ensuring that these vehicles are affordable for all families and manufactured by workers with good jobs. It will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030, while promoting strong labor, training, and installation standards. His plan also will replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrify at least 20 percent of our yellow school bus fleet through a new Clean Buses for Kids Program at the Environmental Protection Agency, with support from the Department of Energy. These investments will set us on a path to 100 percent clean buses, while ensuring that the American workforce is trained to operate and maintain this 21st¬†century infrastructure. Finally, it will utilize the vast tools of federal procurement to electrify the federal fleet, including the United States Postal Service.‚Äù*  Without going into details, the investment will include funds to help automakers secure materials for electric vehicle production and converting factories.  The announcement confirms that the initiative will also revamp the consumer incentive to buy electric vehicles.  Again without going into the details, we do have a confirmation that it will not only be a tax credit, but it will also be available at the point of sale, which is going to facilitate sales.  The summary also confirms that this incentive is only going to be for ‚ÄúAmerican-made‚Äù electric vehicles.  Recently, Democrats have introduced several new legislations to reform the EV tax incentives and one of them, [the GREEN act](https://electrek.co/2021/02/26/more-generous-electric-car-federal-tax-credit-reform-being-proposed/), included a point-of-sales aspect.  &#x200B;  CREDIT -ELECTREK  long clean energy etc seem to be the play.Thoughts?|2021-03-31 12:32:31

swnos5|mh2ryh|mh2ryh|81|After some 3-4 years of highs and lows on WSB, GME has finally made me life changing money, again, but this time I‚Äôm holding strong. I‚Äôve literally went from a normal money‚Äôd dude with a wife and no college degree. Life is different now. I could literally live off the 1-3% SPY/QQQ ETF‚Äôs, and live off that forever.  God bless WSB. MU 45 Su Bae 1ronyman GUH CRON bull run/TLRY explosion  Man, I loved checking in on WSB when it was low key, under 250k subs. It made me very rich and very poor many times. Most times I didn‚Äôt cash out near the top. Ugh one time I showed my coworkers making 100k in a week, and 30k in a day. Literally lost all 100k real quick, but now I‚Äôve rallied up basically my whole workplace on GME. I‚Äôve changed two of my coworker friends‚Äô lives.  Back when they missed out on me telling them about FCEL at .50, they listened to me for GME at $15. One of the lowest paid employees is up 300%+ on her fcel, it‚Äôs hilarious, she‚Äôs a better trader than all the other car salesmen.  Man, life is different God bless GME and WSB|2021-03-31 07:12:24

swglu9|mh2ryh|mh2ryh|25|Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.  There just isn‚Äôt all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we‚Äôve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn‚Äôt kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don‚Äôt seem to be any catalysts until then.  We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn‚Äôt move things very much unless there‚Äôs major deviation from what‚Äôs anticipated.  That leaves us with today‚Äôs infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration‚Äôs first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).  But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don‚Äôt look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That‚Äôs still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump‚Äôs tax cuts.  That‚Äôs it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I‚Äôm sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.  So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that‚Äôs what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats‚Äô majority in the Senate is razor thin.  In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn‚Äôt be the first time.|2021-03-31 05:36:39

swjns4|mh2ryh|mh2ryh|5|UBS analysts led by David Vogt upgraded their rating on Apple AAPL, -1.23% to buy from neutral and lifted the price target to $142 from $115. "While our analysis of iPhone procurement and mix drives our FY22 estimates higher and our 'Core' value to $128 (from $115), our analysis of the auto market and Apple's multi-year investment in the industry (self-driving car licenses and LiDAR patents) suggests to us Apple's auto optionality is worth at least an incremental $14/share," they said. UBS says an Apple-branded battery electric vehicle, or BEV, could achieve a 5% market share.

sx3224|mh2ryh|mh2ryh|2|(I'm getting tired of the same tickers being spammed all the time so I'm going to start buying and researching more obscure ones in terms of discussion rates on here)  feeling good about CHPT longterm.   Quick DD:   - They're down from their 1 year high by 50% - More companies are going in all EV (Voltswaken being a recent silly example) - Biden's Infrastructure plan, whether it passes or not marks the beginning of more discussions EV.  - Chargepoint is the largest network of independent EV chargers.   GAMBLE: They're a decent acquisition target for any company who wants to quickly increase their EV charging footprint   Risks:  - EVs might be a bust. My take: this is very very unlikely to happen  - Chargepoint charging stations might not be popular. My take: this is definitely possible, but is mitigated by the fact that the rising tide of charging stations raises all ships in that it increases EV adoption which will help CHPT even if there's a more popular competitor.   It's a no brainer if you're going to buy and hold.  Position 300 shares|2021-03-31 09:35:47

swjo21|mh2ryh|mh2ryh|1|I don't understand why people are expecting gme to squeeze. Moreover, they keep pointing at the VW squeeze. A gme squeeze of that proportions is never going to happen due to a simple reason: we're not singular. People WILL cash out their positions when they see it convenient, at 300/400/500 etc. Sure, gme will have a lot of small squeezes, but never a big one. It's just not possible because there are a lot of people profiteering off those who expect a 'big squeeze'.|2021-03-31 06:21:35

swxa45|mh2ryh|mh2ryh|-6|My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to invest, I would buy ZOM.|2021-03-31 08:47:38
