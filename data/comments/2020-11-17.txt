cnc5t2|jvr81t|jvr81t|10|JFC.  You all are warned every single time about playing earnings.  People always exit right before earnings to scalp some small profit right before an ER.  Then they sell off after ER as well, and IV collapses.  Even if the stock goes up tomorrow, we will get tons of posts from people asking why their NIO ITM are worth shit.  Dude, that's what happens if you buy stupidly overpriced options with IVs over 200.    Beating earnings almost always means stocks go down.  80% of companies beat earnings, so it doesn't mean much.  There has to be some sort of unexpected surprise, forward guidance or an earnings beat that is exponentially better than expected to see any meaningful gain after ERs.  Theta gang will probably be the only winners yet again.|2020-11-17 14:36:39

clq6as|jvr81t|jvr81t|12|r/coronavirus is a fuckin doomer circle jerk. There’s people claiming it there that they’ve gone to Walmart and not only seem less than half of people there wearing masks, but employees not wearing them either.   I work for Sam’s and can’t even pull down my mask to take a drink of water, and while I have seen an increase of people refusing to wear masks, it’s still way less than 5%. I’m not saying our customers have similar numbers to Walmart or anything, but I can guarantee employers are forced to wear masks lmao.

cmqvzn|jvr81t|jvr81t|6|The year: 2074.  I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. That's when the joy left. That's when hope left.  I'm not a religious man, but I sometimes allow my mind to slip away into pleasant things. I imagine holding her again. I run my fingers through her strawberry-blonde hair. Maybe it's in heaven, maybe it's not. I don't believe, but pretending makes me feel like me again, if only for one fleeting moment.  I turn on my neuralink and close my eyes. I flip through old pictures. It's her. I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.  I open a browser and check SPY.  361.28.  It hasn't moved in decades now, it would seem. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days. When I was happy. When she was here.  Sitting alone in an empty room, I let out a weak, broken whimper: "SPY flat... and gay."|2020-11-17 11:54:18

In 2020, the sheer magnitude of the r/wallstreetbets community and the funds they injected into the market thanks to the 3T cares act started to introduce significant volatility into the stock market. Hedge fund managers reportedly threw their analysts out of top floor windows as the definition of a profitable stock trade had gone out the window as well and the analysts were encouraged to go retrieve it.

Otherwise, SEA is well oiled machine firing on all cylinders (e-gaming and digital entertainment with Garena, e-shopping with Shopee).

cms09b|jvr81t|jvr81t|6|Palantir has legitimately been the secret driving force behind numerous 'big data' projects the past decade. They were the software analysts for anti-terrorism, they helped bring down Bernie Madoff, they were rumored to be how Osama bin Laden was located, they built the infrastructure for Covid hospital data in both the US and UK (and barely charged the NHS in the UK, which is mega-suspicious that they built that huge data-base as well as "good will"), they have been helping aerospace companies save money...they're fucking everywhere. Their founders choose the name 'Palantir' for a reason, based off the Tolkien's LoTR Palantiri which were the 'all-seeing orbs'.  https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/16/21323458/palantir-ipo-hhs-protect-peter-thiel-cia-intelligence  They have a hand in almost literally fucking everything, and allow the corporations/customers they service to take "full credit" for the finished products.  They built their analysis using IBM-Watsonesque 'unstructured data' reserves. It's cutting edge technology and perspective, and yes they work with "evil" occasionally but they try to remain true to their Libertarian "not my problem what you use us for, we just want the money" philosophy.|2020-11-17 12:02:42

cmm83k|jvr81t|jvr81t|4|HIMX, growth stock. VR,AR,AI learning tech  Buy HIMX, next 10bagger.  Worthy currently 759m. Revenue hitting 309m????? I know wtf?? So cheap underpriced. AR /VR are just getting started. Cheap AI cameras, power efficient(big breakthrough). They make AI tech that collects info/ data from real world efficiently. VR and AR gaming component supplier, leading R&amp;D. Will be largest by 2021-2024 imo. Partnered with ibm (not disclosed).    30%+ y/y in revenue only increasing.  Fuck weed stock, fuck electric car stock, AR VR time guys. Be ahead. Tsla will need their AI camera and R&amp;Ds too. These new technology will be needed by everyone even uber. A lot of applications.    Buy now. Easy 10b company which is around 60$.|2020-11-17 11:18:53

clyc8x|jvr81t|jvr81t|3|TSLA is not going to 500 and 600 under these conditions and the inclusion is a liquidity event to allow breathing room for majoy holders to exit on top of 400 while you guys provide the exit on your buy orders. Think about this logically.  The major holders need to unload. If they unload at 400-420 the next support is 360 and then 330 and then sub 300. The moves down are always violent because nobody wants to be caught holding a car company valued like a space warfare company at ATH's or near to them.  The play: InCluDe TsLa in S&Penis500 ->>> massive gap up  Fanboys: reeee 6000 buy calls weeee Elon fuck my mom please i beg you  The real play: selloff same day heavy but sustain above previous day  Fanboys: "it's just profit taking. double down and ride with us or forever hold your peace gay losers who dont gargle elon's ballsack daily wooooo  Continuation of the play: gap down following morning and crush the week but sustain above 370 which is where the put volume realllllly picks up.  What happens in all of this?  1. bears get slaughtered and sell today 2. bulls get rock solid and buy today 3. they pay for the losses on the decline with the call premium being issued on the pump 4. they reduce the payout on the downside by buying back most contracts for nothing during the first three hours of the day 5. they get rich and know you'll buy the next bull run anyways.  See the september 1-9 daily candles to understand the play visually.|2020-11-17 07:55:46

(NYSE:NIO).  Cramer said younger people love Nio and love individual stocks or "obvious'" plays like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).  Nio has rallied approximately 1167.5% since the beginning of 2020. The stock was trading up 4% at $47.41 on Tuesday at the time of publication.  The company is set to report third-quarter earnings results after the market closes today.

clngi5|jvr81t|jvr81t|-4|Am I allowed to link a [Kitco interview video?](https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-11-16/A-sober-2021-gold-price-target-say-goodbye-to-phenomenal-drivers-HSBC-s-Jim-Steel.html?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_recirculation) I'll take the slap on the wrist if that's too 'newsy'. Analyst at HSBC is giving a gold price projection of $1,960 as an average for 2021. That, along with Buffett dumping his Barrick Gold at a loss makes it sound like the deflation narrative is becoming more mainstream as more and more institutions are relaying similar messages. Justified? Probably, but if we learned anything from 2020 it's that when investors and traders have a mindset they overdo it and it ends up snapping in both directions. I'll be following metals closely but I'm waiting to make a move.|2020-11-17 05:34:00

And Nanna and Popop lose their life savings....EVERYONCE  CAN BLAME TESLA, bc, after all, it was the most heavily shorted stock etc etc. A magnificently Machiavellian plan btw|2020-11-17 06:45:07
