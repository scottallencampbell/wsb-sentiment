Reminder that Tesla was a $25 stock in March 2020 during the COVID crash, where SPY went down to $223. I think SPY could go as low as $150 in the next 2 years as the mother of all crashes is finally experienced. Tesla could easily be a $10 stock at the bottom. Even that valuation would give them 1/3 of the price of the highest market cap automaker (assuming Toyota drops along with the rest of the market), besides Tesla right now. And that's with Tesla losing EV market share by the day. No chance this price holds. Will I short it?
