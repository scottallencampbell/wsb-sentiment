The uncertainty of that happening is why you find yourself smack in the middle of $230 and and $330 right now.

Almost all of the airlines got hit hard on the 737 grounding. With that being said we have Southwest, American and other airlines reporting tomorrow. Will their guidance get raised now that they have a relatively hard date and are scheduled to be back on track as early as January? My thoughts are yes. And if they beat on earnings then it's an added bonus. Even though JBLU doesn't have many 737's in their fleet they did well on earnings and ran almost 8% yesterday. UAL also beat. Buy airline calls!  *This is not financial advice. and i'm retarded.*|2019-10-23 10:13:28

4ux9g6|dlxo0i|dlxo0i|12|Alright so i can't play right now cause i got no more monies on my acct and gold leaps in big loss i don't wanna sell but here's some tea leaves derived from shadowtrader weekly vid.  SPX is in a balance area from **2973 to 3008**, we gapped up 2 times in a row trying to escape this zone with good ER up to ATH.  Friday to Monday : **2986 to 2996**  Monday to Tuesday : **3006.7 to 3010.8** just above that balance area.  Yesterday it defended that **3008** area (and thus the newly created gap) in the morning, but it did fill the gap around noon and then got rejected again around **3015** and since it failed to breakout higher it goes back into balance and targets the other side of the area : **2973**.  I wasn't up yesterday so i don't know what news could trigger the selloff other than the technicals : fail breakout : target other side of balance AKA SELL SELL SELL to 2973  Overnight we filled the friday/monday gap and we're sitting right on it at **2986** right now (well it was when i wrote this). That's right pajama traders don't have the balls to take us lower, they saw a filthy gap to 2986 and filled it but then pussies out of shorting this shit to 2973, wanted more information. We touched 2986 area two times overnight which implies we're gonna test is in session imo.  Targets to look out for : **2986**, bottom of balance area **2973** and it's gap right below **2966**, we might fill this before a further try at a rally, or we might try to dip below the balance area just like we tried to rally above but i doubt it.  I bet we open around 2990 and then selloff in the morning and V around noon.  Balance area is 35 points so 35 points lower brings us to **2938** which is no coincidence : it's the fucking close/gap from thursday 10th to friday 11th  No economic news data today besides Earnings so ER will decide the fate of SPX for the next few days.  Those that went short/puts yesterday not believing in this breakout above balance congratulations. Shorting above 3010 really was a sane idea yesterday, we had little reasons to be this high other than bulls trying a rally.  Today we most likely touch **2973 or 2966** area and then be on the lookout for a further dip below to **2938** or a rally up into balance area targeting **3008**, since most of the move back into balance area already happened today will likely be a good theta day. Not much reason to go back down **2938** just yet, not enough good ER to target **3008** as well.  Euro markets are down after hopes of a good brexit deal fades away once again and extension is back on the menu, the pound rally is stopped but it didn't dip back down (yet)  Gold seems to be bouncing fairly well from **1480** area, seems like it's waiting eagerly FOMC which is now at **93.5%** chance of a cut on Oct 31.  ***TL;DR*** : sell off yesterday on fail bull breakout of range, now back into range most likely good theta day waiting for more ER to come out. Other possibility : shitty ER from this morning bring us to **2938**, very very low chance tho, most likely dance continue dancing in balance between **2973-3008**  **oh also MCD on discount, maybe wait a few days ? Maybe WM on discount too if ER isn't great**|2019-10-23 07:04:23

In 2008 the Fed lowered rates from 5.25% to 0.25%... and the recession still hit hard.  If we get a recession in 2020, the Fed doing a similar amount of easing would result in interest rates of... negative 2.5% or something insane like that. The consequences of a negative interest rate on the reserve currency would be catastrophic.|2019-10-23 07:57:41

4w5ovy|dlxo0i|dlxo0i|6|so in the monday after hours thread i posted that i was considering starting to yolo a little money here and there at random biopharm companies.  the comment was semi tongue in cheek, then the next morning bio gen exploded and it got me thinking more about the idea.  if these things interest you, here's one ive found.  this company called durect (DRRX) has been selected to present their alcoholic hepatitis treatment drug [DUR-928](https://investors.durect.com/news-releases/news-release-details/durect-announces-dur-928-phase-2a-alcoholic-hepatitis-study?field_nir_news_date_value[min]=2019) at the AASLD annual meeting on november 8-12.  this is a collection of doctors who study and try to treat/cure extremely serious liver diseases.  out of 3000 abstracts that were selected for presentation this year, DUR-928 is 1 of only 29 that were late-breaking (i gather this means its brand new information, they made a breakthrough since the initial deadline and resubmitted their study to present at the meeting).  apparently its being tolerated and showing promise in clinical trials.  food for thought|2019-10-23 12:34:53

4wedxl|dlxo0i|dlxo0i|6|Gay ass $MSFT DD:  Microsoft signed PrO sTrEaMeR Ninja to Mixer in August. He currently has 2.4 million followers and over 26 million views since August 1st.   Mixer has microtransactions. You can buy "Embers" to help support streamers. The current *weekly* leader has given 9,600 Embers. Probably roughly around ~$100 in a week; with many others also giving Embers as well.   I imagine you can also earn Embers by watching ads...  This will likely give Microsoft's Xbox and Gaming division a nice big boost, which slumped in previous earnings reports.   Microsoft also partnered with AT&T in July worth $2 Billion; moving all AT&T employees to Windows 10 and Office 365, along with moving all their applications and services to Azure.   All this shit is PrObAbLy PrIcEd but Microsoft does seem poised to smash earnings.   Question is, do investors really believe that MSFT is actually worth over $1 Trillion?|2019-10-23 13:23:26

4w3lk2|dlxo0i|dlxo0i|5|I have a theory that it's possible to whisper into someone's sensory inputs a specific string of words/sounds/light in order to elicit **any** arbitrary target response. Such a string may be incredibly complex and lengthy, and wouldn't necessarily be an an autonomic/primal response, but one that depends on abstractions such as memory. This is a loosely constrained thought experiment (e.g. time indefinite, no adversarial strings). For example, imagine a suave cultist converting a new member over 2 years, using a bespoke "script".  Then we have a theory the same concept could be applied to the algos. **Someone please paint the charts "correctly" in order to elicit a flash crash.**|2019-10-23 12:23:13

4wus95|dlxo0i|dlxo0i|2|Fellow autists, the market is behaving very gayly so it's time for **Magical Crayons TA.**  The predicted TA [from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlgbuh/daily_discussion_thread_october_22_2019/f4s51p5/) was very much in line with today's ranges. If you have your tinfoil hat on like I do, given the extremely low volume it's possible that the algos are just ping-ponging shit around at this point because those support and resistance levels usually are more ballpark than exact.  In short, we keep bouncing off of the top of Oct 14th's weekly support trendline as [you can see here on the 15 minute chart](https://imgur.com/NxJ8RJA). The drop this morning, which broke the support, neatly filled the gap from October 18 and bounced back up which suggests that bullish sentiment is very much in play still. As a hibernating bear, I again offer my condolences to all fellow bears-- this market is just not a good environment for puts right now if there is no market-shearing news.  What should we expect tomorrow? Basically, a continuation of this price action. If you're bearish, supports around 298.7 are things to watch. Again, if it doesn't break that support with any sort of conviction, you're better off flipping to a call if it touches those ranges. The next support level would be around 298, so if we drop below 298.7 and remain there, those would be the next set of trading ranges for the week-- 298.7-298.  Currently, we're more likely to stay at/above 298.7 if earnings are neutral to good tomorrow, although it seems even if earnings are bad it doesn't matter (see: $BA, $CAT) so maybe there aren't any sincere market shakers upcoming. If you're a bull, I note again that any inappropriate touching of 300.1 would suggest a quick gap-fill up to 300.5.  Good luck you autists.|2019-10-23 14:44:18
