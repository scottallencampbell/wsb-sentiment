hei5ai|f2plur|f2plur|10|This is different from dotcom bubble in 2 different ways:  1. During dotcom bubble, you had many companies that didn't have revenues, not even a business plan, just a rough business idea and a website with investors throwing billions at them. Today even bubble stocks like Shopify with high P/Es have actual revenues and solid growth.   2. During dotcom bubble, Fed Funds Rate was 5% and there was no QE. You could put your money into a savings account and get 5-6% and many retirees did exactly that because it was less risky than stonks. Now everyone is forced into stonks because there is nowhere else to go.|2020-02-12 09:55:06
hekmhi|f2plur|f2plur|10|For everyone FOMOing into $SPCE LEAPs:  Don't just buy January 2021/January 2022 OTM calls. At least not exclusively.   A 1/15/21 $30c costs $4.80    Instead, buy a 1/15/21 $15c and sell a 1/15/21 $35c. This costs $6.30. If you buy the $30c outright, your breakeven at expiration is $34.80/share. Anything under that, you lose money. If you play the spread, your breakeven is $21.30. If SPCE closes January 2021 at $40/share, if you bought the call outright, you'd make $620. If you play the spread, you'd make $1370.   Do some math y'all|2020-02-12 10:19:52

It's extremely rare for MSFT to be down 3 days in a row. It only happens a few times out of a year and reverses on the next day.

hfazvo|f2plur|f2plur|17|**Magical Crayons TA.**  Wanted to post this intraday because lots of stuff on the crayons are changing, so people can start making up their minds on holdings for tomorrow.  [SPY is projecting to close](https://imgur.com/gaZZnZB) on the resistance [I mentioned yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2f0ag/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_12/fhcb3by/) at around 337. However, any autist can notice that we've broken above the green crayon (resistance trendline) twice now, and broken 337 already today. Normally this means we should start to head into a new price channel, and we might. I think it will hinge on price action tomorrow.   If we jump up tomorrow, resistance is at 339.2. It would also put us back into the strong bullish trend we had before the Corona correction, which we've been trying to recover from since.  However, there are two things that might make the reward of hedging a few puts a decent idea. [/NQ futures is about to test the top of their resistance channel,](https://imgur.com/1Hl787s) which has not been broken since November of 2019. [VIX is also starting to break below its current trend](https://imgur.com/GE1WgNO), which means a reversal on all these fronts (resistance on SPY, NQ, support on VIX) would make a lot of "crayon" sense.  CPI is being released tomorrow, and for the past two years has been above this time's projected 0.2% increase in Feb (0.6% in 2017, 0.4% in 2018). You can argue whether inflation is "bad" or "good," but it may be difficult to judge how the market will react if we have a much higher CPI than anticipated.   So again, based on crayons and CPI tomorrow, I think trimming holdings some or hedging with a few puts is not a bad idea in terms of risk/reward. But crayons can't predict exactly what's going to happen, and like any voodoo shit, crayons can be read differently based on who you are (i.e. someone seeing the crack in VIX and SPY could read it as nothing but good times ahead). I just wanted to bring this to your attention so you can decide how best to keep your tendies.|2020-02-12 14:36:27

I'm willing to go along with a bunch of you and start a massive business that will pour in billions of dollars for this sub by ~~betting~~ investing in $WSB.  So, now that the hard part is done in figuring out what ticker we would use and that we will start a business and bring it public, what types of products or services can we build together? Any experts in some stuff in here?  Lastly, do we go public the DEAC/SPCE way? or are we going IPO way? Depends on who's on the board I guess...|2020-02-12 11:50:06

Even if they don't get it they are loading up on infrastructure technology for 5G networks.  5G networks are a joke but apparently everyone missed that memo.  Throw a $100 on some FDs.

heri13|f2plur|f2plur|4|RAY DALIO TWEET  Clarification: It was reported that I said that I believe that that reports of the Coronavirus are exaggerated. This was a misleading characterization of an answer I gave when asked what I thought of the virus, so let me clarify what I said and think. (1/4)  I think that I am a ‚Äúdumb shit‚Äù relative to experts on the subject so I shouldn‚Äôt be asked, but if I were to guess, there is a wide range of possible outcomes.   I think the most likely outcome is that this virus will be a larger version of SARS that will have a significant temporary effect but won‚Äôt have a big long term influence, so the downward market price moves related to it are probably becoming exaggerated  While my statement wasn‚Äôt accurately reported, I probably should have just stopped answering at the point of trying to convey that I‚Äôm a dumb shit on that subject. Sorry for my part of that confusion. (4/4)  DUMB SHIT RAY DALIO ( DENNIS GARTMANS SUCCESSOR) THINKS CORONA WILL HAVE NO LONG TERM IMPACT ALL IN POOTS|2020-02-12 11:27:03

hel9ut|f2plur|f2plur|1|Fucking shop and my fucking weak hands. I had sold a $390-610 spread expiring this week so I'd be fine as long as the stock didn't move more than 20% this week on earnings. The fucking stock immediately opens up 18% just to fuck with me so the call side of my trade doesn't see any IV crash at all, in fact jumps higher.   An hour later it starts fading a bit so I close my position at a small loss. Literally 15 minutes after that, the positions I closed finally see an IV crash and would have been profitable if I held. Here is how you make a trade with 99% chance of success (0.01 delta) and still manage to lose money when the market really wants to fuck with you.|2020-02-12 10:26:15

Im trying tk basically start with 200 dollars that I transferred into Robinhood, and was wondering what I can do with that really. Realistically I have about 800 dollars to play around with though but so that I don‚Äôt lose it all immediately. I know the basics of basically everything like looking for things like a  good PE ratio. Ive just never really actually fully got into this. So where would you guys think is a good place to start? And how are good ways to discover new companies/etfs/stocks aside from just going into stores and seeing whats selling?|2020-02-12 17:44:39
