uz49xu|ykxxln|ykxxln|7|Looking for actual advice. Bought 1/20 $370 SPY puts when it ran up to $388 before JPOW fucked a bull live on stage. Timed it almost perfectly, now I’m 55% up on said puts and love the money I’ve made. However… I always seem to hold on to options too long when they’re losers and sell too soon when they’re winners. Sold enough of them today to cover my initial cost. But feeling like I want to let the rest ride. Lol made $80,000 on GME squeeze off of $1200, but since then I’ve lost all of it and then some like a true regard. ![img](emotet5_2th524267)|2022-11-03 21:00:05

Since inflation is likely to persist due to said spending in addition to all other factors remaining pretty much the same, rates will continue to rise and we will start to see people unable to service their debt. * They will not be able to service their debt because goods remain in the range that got them into debt in the first place.

I've included the standard responses you should have to make it easy.  * Switch from the 5m chart to the 15m chart: "Oh damn." * Switch from the 15m chart to the 30m chart: "Oh shit." * Switch from the 15m chart to the 60m chart: "Oh fuck." * Switch from the 60m chart to the daily chart: "I've made a huge mistake."  If you first had to switch from the 1m chart, then you're an absolute regard of monumental proportions; ignore this guide and focus whatever brainpower you have into making sure you can make your lungs breathe properly.

uwhn75|ykxxln|ykxxln|4|I think J.Powell should just set the Fed Funds Rate to 120%.  The lower it by 1bps every 5 mins during market hours, he would only do the 1bps rate cut if the market behaves it self.  If the market is a bad boi, he would then do a 5bps rate hike.   This is so stupid, that it would work 100%.|2022-11-03 10:05:02

As long as their core business has not declined much (looking at microvast and the range bound crypto has lived in it looks like it will be flat), and they post like Robinhood a surprise beat thanks to interest income it will pop.  I say this as a long time COIN bear who has been playing short from $200. I think this ER has been setup so they cannot possibly fail.   Personally I went short and closed positions today for the run down. And will short any pop after ER.

uxbgfw|ykxxln|ykxxln|1|Long time COIN bear here.   I'm only riding about half my positions into ER. Opened puts at 77$ last Tuesday so took profits and now riding on house money.    With that said I am strictly holding that house money as a lotto ticket.  I am very skeptical we see downside on this ER even though I think the fair price of COIN in the current market with known info is ~40$.   My big concern, and I cannot stress how big (very big). Is their rock bottom analysts predictions which isn't factoring in interest earnings and a proxy huge surprise in interest earnings (from Robin hood).  Although I see long term downside on COIN with out major crypto market recovery I can see a surprise beat on their interest income blowing out puts tomorrow.   COIN has been my #1 trade position and profit maker this year, check actual post history to WSB I have posted multiple DDs and gains.   ER gonna be wild, and depending on interest revenue it's either popping 10-15% tomorrow or dropping like a waterfall to <50.|2022-11-03 13:16:52

uvtfpr|ykxxln|ykxxln|-1|Since the spring I've been listening to the fomc press conference live and trying to guess how it will affect markets. Yesterday, i thought J Powell was somewhat doveish. Thought he made a point of saying the some headline numbers weren't telling the full story and that some sectors of the economy were slowing and that made inflation was limited to areas the fed can't directly affect.    But the market reacted as if he was more hawkish than ever. Why? Cause he hinted the terminal rate will be higher that we will remain at a restrictive rate for longer? That the idea of a soft landing is starting to go the way of the idea of  transitory inflation?    I'm starting to think that the fed can't really control inflation as well as they think they can. They are trying to be surgical and it's entrenching inflation in the American psyche. For instance, they aren't even going to get to the federal funds rate they suggested would be adequate, 4.6, by the end of the year and Powell all but said yesterday they needed to get to a rate above the inflation number.|2022-11-03 06:59:52

uxe8ne|ykxxln|ykxxln|-9|Bears didn't listen to the Fed yesterday. Yeah, JPOW shut down the immediate pivot talk. He also stated they were slowing down the rate of interest growth.   The Fed is talking FOMC-to-FOMC as a decision making window, only looking at historic impact data rather than forecast data. The markets are looking forward, and the prediction cloud of probability for future rates did lose the likelihood of a lower rate in 6-9mo timeframe, but it also lost the more bearish Fed likelihood of 6+% interest in the 3-6mo timeframe that would come with sustained 75bps bumps beyond December.|2022-11-03 13:34:41
