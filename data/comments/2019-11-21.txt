87nxr2|dzhqjm|dzhqjm|31|Dips like this being bought up violently is a typical sign of a market where participants are under-invested and feel they "missed the boat". Yesterday when I said I'm shorting SPX (on the back of change in Trump's rhetoric about china - he threatened them on Tuesday with new tariffs) I went long 0DTE puts and closed when we went to 13DMA (3096). I wouldn't feel comfortable holding weekly puts today.  This bounce makes me think that it's dangerous to bet on continuation of a bearish move.  Also HK bill doesn't matter (because Trump wants to keep it quiet to get the deal, and China wants to keep it quiet - Trump will just keep it on his desk for a while) and Epstein didn't kill himself.|2019-11-21 06:12:08

885lfo|dzhqjm|dzhqjm|8|>**The S&P 500 Selloff That Didn't Bite**   >   >By Andrew Cinko   >   >**It was a jolt to see the S&P 500 falling by as much as 1% midday yesterday, but it did no damage whatsoever**. And even though stocks are lower in early trading, today's happy headline about the possibility of the Dec. 15 tariff increase being delayed should ensure that Wednesday's drop has little carryover into today.   >   >During the pullback, the rising 20-day moving average was in no danger of being punctured. Rising S&P futures this morning means stocks will avoid making a run at that trend line, which has been a decent arbiter of short-term changes in direction since June.   >   >What yesterday's retreat did accomplish is remove the S&P 500's overbought signals from the 14-day RSI basis (though of course that may return today) and the 14-day stochastics measures. Both are minor positive developments in that they remove a bearish talking point, but don't necessarily clear the path for the bulls.**Small investors remain gun-shy of buying stocks at record highs -- that's clear from the bull-bear spread in the American Association of Individual Investors survey**. While sentiment has rebounded from August's depressed levels when recession was the talk of the town, there's probably only one way to ignite small investors' animal spirits: a trade deal. Until there's a definitive answer on that front, *small moves* will remain the most popular adjective for describing equities.|2019-11-21 09:09:33

899o9b|dzhqjm|dzhqjm|5|I'll do a quick **Magical Crayons TA.**  Market is in a fight now to prevent the correction. I'm watching the NASDAQ and its futures closely. I posted the crayons for it [last night](https://imgur.com/Q4ShbIq) and you can see how [it's developed today.](https://imgur.com/a/Rcknlu0) Now that we have broken below that support line we've traded most of the day today below it, and each time it's tried to shake it off it's been stopped. This is a bearish sign short-term.   As I said, I'll be watching for it to start heading towards 8220, the second support. If we can climb back out and have a sustained consolidation or push back over the initial support, things may well be fine. But if we break below that second support, the next support is a bit farther down-- and as I've said, I would anticipate losing 8220 would begin the "full" correction in SPY to that 307ish mark I'm looking at as the bounce off to continue the bull run.

88w9ov|dzhqjm|dzhqjm|9|The crazy thing is if you look back at an hourly chart all the big drops over the last 6 months have been made in a few hourly candles. The 10/1 plunge from $298 to $287 was only 9 hourly candles. The 8/1 plunge from $300 to $284 was only 17 hourly candles...  My point is, in situations like we are in now teetering on dropping down. It happens so quick that if you aren’t preemptively in the trade you might miss the actual move.   So like now, we are sitting around $310..we could wake up in 7-14 hourly candles and be sitting at $295. It’s because of this weird market dynamic we are in right now. Squeeze up and up and up and then dump. Rinse and repeat. But this type of charting was very unusual even 10 years ago.|2019-11-21 12:55:30

89bnaw|dzhqjm|dzhqjm|4|Not a good day for me.  Bough AMD calls during the dip and kepts buying as it kept dipping. Eventually sold them for no gain/loss.  Also bought SPY calls during the dip and was up a good 15% at one point. Sold them at a 15% loss near market close (right before it jumped up in the last 3 minutes)  Bought SPY puts 3 weeks out because it seems we are near a top where any bad news can make the market drop 3% in a day. I might have bought these too soon as we've had 3 red days in a row now.|2019-11-21 15:06:10

WATCH NOW VIDEO02:45 Phase two, three of the trade deal may remain ‘distant’: Morgan Stanley   Separately on Thursday, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources, that China’s lead trade negotiator Liu He said at a dinner speech Wednesday that he was cautiously optimistic about a phase-one trade agreement with the U.S. The report added that Liu told an attendee he was “confused” by the U.S. demands, while remaining confident that a phase-one agreement could be reached.   *Tldr: tradetalksgoingwell.exe*|2019-11-21 07:55:24

89ad61|dzhqjm|dzhqjm|2|[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc\_2019q3.pdf](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc_2019q3.pdf)   Household Debt and Credit Developments in 2019Q31  Aggregate household debt balances increased by $92 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a 0.7% increase, and now stand at 13.95 trillion. Balances have been steadily rising for five years and in aggregate are now $1.3 trillion higher, in nominal terms, than the previous peak (2008Q3) peak of $12.68 trillion. Overall household debt is now 25.1 % above the 2013Q2 trough.    Mortgage balances shown on consumer credit reports on September 30 stood at $9.44 trillion, a $31 billion increase from 2019Q2. Balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have been declining since 2009, and this quarter’s decline of $3 billion brings the outstanding balance to $396 billion.  Non-housing balances increased by 64 billion in the third quarter,  with increases across the board, including $18 billion in auto loans, $13 billion in credit card balances, and $20 billion in student loans.   New extensions of credit were strong for the third quarter. Auto loan originations, which include both newly opened loans and leases, remained high in the third quarter, at $159 billion, a small increase from the last quarter’s volume but the second highest ever observed. Mortgage originations, which we measure as appearances of new mortgage balances on consumer credit reports and which include refinances,  were at $528 billion,  a notable jump from the $445 billion seen in the same quarter last year.    Aggregate credit limits on credit cards also increased, by $27 billion, continuing a 10-year upward trend. Credit standards tightened slightly in the third quarter. The median credit score of newly originating borrowers increased in the third quarter for mortgages, to 765, a 6 point increase from the first half of the year.   Auto loans also saw tightening in underwriting standards, with an 8 point increase in the median originating credit score.  The origination volume remained high, with $30 billion in subprime originations, a level on par with the last several years.  Aggregate delinquency rates worsened in the third quarter of 2019.  As of September 30,  4.8% of outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency, a 0.4 percentage point increase from the second quarter due primarily to increases in early delinquency buckets. Of the $667 billion of debt that is delinquent, $424 billion is seriously delinquent (at least 90 days late or “severely derogatory”, which includes some debts that have previously been charged off that the lenders continue to attempt collection).   About 186,000 consumers had a bankruptcy notation added to their credit reports in 2019Q3, an improvement from the 215,000 in 2018Q3.|2019-11-21 14:56:06
