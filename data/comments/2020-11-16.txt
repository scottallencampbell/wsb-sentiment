chhz9z|jv52hs|jv52hs|204|I will summarize today’s thread so you don’t have to read it later today:   -	People acting like NIO is their favorite football team they have followed since childhood going to the Super Bowl for the first time  -	Some assorted comments about PLTR by people who think the computer just got invented  -	Conspiracy theories about MMs being responsible for all market moves   -	Lots of people identifying with homosexual bears probably because zoos are closed and they don’t know how to express anything more complex than...  -	Rocket emojis. Way, way, way too many rocket emojis.   There. Enjoy your Monday! Leave the thread before you are lost!|2020-11-16 05:19:30

And guess who pulls the price up that high pre market? MM and institutional investors. Those scalping cunts drove a huge drop on prices and buy at 10% cheaper, making big money think twice about putting money into PLTR...

ciy2o7|jv52hs|jv52hs|10|[From the squeezemetrics white paper on the Dark pool Index, discussing what an MM is](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short_is_long.pdf)  > To understand, you need to know how market-makers (MMs) do business. Traditionally, market-makers make their money by “quoting a spread.” This means placing a bid at, say, $19.95, and an offer at $20.00. Since the MMs have no position in the stock, the offer at $20.00 is necessarily entered as a short sale―they don't own it, so they can't actually sell it.†  > Now imagine the common scenario where one investor sells to the MM at $19.95 and another buys from the MM at $20.00. Knowing that MMs place short sales at the offer, we know that only one of these trades will be reported as “short”―the one where the investor is buying stock at $20.00.  > This means that whenever a market-maker fills an investor's buy order, the MM is facilitating the trade by shorting shares. Thus, short volume is actually representative of investor buying volume, and non-short volume is representative of investor selling volume. It's no coincidence that short volume is predictably half of total volume―short sales represent the buying half of the market, and long (non-short) sales represent the selling half.  > Maybe you don't find this convincing. What about those speculative short sellers? Don't they throw the number off? (No. That volume is tiny.) What about passive sell orders from traders who aren't market-makers? Wouldn't their sales show up as not short? (Yes. But they'll still be selling to a MM, so we would correctly interpret them as sales.) The U.S. equities market is infamous for its complexity―how can we make such sweeping assertions? Granted, it does seem that the market is too multifaceted, and opaque, for short volume to simply equate to investor buying volume, but there's a practical reason that today's market is more transparent than you might imagine. In a word, rebates. Here's the story. Back in 1997, when the U.S. market's tightest spread was 12.5 cents,* the Island ECN (an off-exchange trading venue for NASDAQ stocks) started doing something different: They paid market-makers to do what market-makers already do―quote a spread. Whenever a trader “took” the liquidity that the MM posted at the bid or offer, that trader would pay a small fee, and most of that fee would be given, as a “rebate,” to the MM. > As a result, Island attracted all kinds of MMs, ending up with tighter spreads, and more depth, than their competitors. Naturally, customers liked this, and within two years, Island had gone from 3% to 13% market share of NASDAQ volume. The idea caught on and other exchanges, public and private, started using the “maker-taker” model and offering rebates. So spreads tightened everywhere.  Posting this because too many of you tards don’t understand what an MM is. They don’t have any stake in the market, they exist to provide liquidity and facilitate trades across the bid-ask spread. Stop blaming them for “manipulation”, it’s like blaming UPS when you realize that the PS5 you ordered from Wish.com was just 5 bricks duct-taped together. You’re the one that made the retarded purchase, UPS just helped get it to you.|2020-11-16 13:30:05

Meanwhile, NIO sold only about 60000 cars since 2018 and has no profits.    And now you wonder why the Chinese EVs will crash?  Valuations will eventually comeback down to reality.  The argument that 'China iz big!!' as the reason why Nio deserves to be valued more than a company that actually sells 500k cars/year, is profitable, and also has increasing growth is absurd.|2020-11-16 06:50:29

chsh6h|jv52hs|jv52hs|7|NIO is down because it’s Monday morning beginning of the week and has been no 11/20 call purchases. I think what drove the run last week was several call purchases, causing MM to hedge with a shit ton of stock purchase. It will only run if there’s big volume on calls during the week. Last week was a big run because of huge 11/13 call volume which was probably from this group alone. That’s basically the formula for every meme stock pump. Autist’s load up on calls, MM hedges with big stock purchases, which drives the price way up.|2020-11-16 07:43:43

chmeaf|jv52hs|jv52hs|5|https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54902908  „The trial involved 30,000 people in the US with half being given two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart. The rest had dummy injections.  The analysis was based on the first 95 to develop Covid-19 symptoms.  Only five of the Covid cases were in people given the vaccine, 90 were in those given the dummy treatment. The company says the vaccine is protecting 94.5%.  The data also shows there were 11 cases of severe Covid in the trial, but none happened in people who were immunised“  This is a fucking joke lol, less funny than Pfizer‘s 60 people sample size but still a joke.|2020-11-16 06:28:15

It has taken another dip because it gets lumped in with the other "only worth so much because of COVID" stocks.  IMHO that's bullshit because DOCU is absolutly something that was gaining a ton of momentum pre-COVID.  Anyway its on one of those on or around 200 dips today so ita a good day to go long or open a LEAP or two if you want to be a little diverse outside of EV's and PLTR.|2020-11-16 07:14:17

ciap1a|jv52hs|jv52hs|3|   Monday morning, Citigroup analyst [Jeff Chung](https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-nio-stock-analysts-keep-saying-one-calls-it-a-long-term-winner-51602790948?mod=article_inline) upgraded [Li Auto](https://www.barrons.com/quote/LI) (ticker: LI) to Buy from Hold and increased his price target to $45.60 from $27.10—or more than 68%. The upgrade comes after Li stock has [gained 59%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/li-auto-stock-skyrockets-after-earnings-report-51605273021?mod=article_inline) over the past month.  In boosting his target price, Chung appears to have become more optimistic about fourth-quarter and 2021 EV sales in China. His new target values Li at roughly [15 times](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stocks-expensive-valuation-wall-street-jargon-pe-ebitda-earnings-51589225609?mod=article_inline) estimated 2021 sales. [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA) (TSLA), for comparison, is trading for about eight times estimated 2021 sales.  Li is growing faster than Tesla, off a small base of vehicle sales, but the Chinese EV valuation multiples don’t have any precedent. Li and its peer [Xpeng](https://www.barrons.com/quote/XPEV) (XPEV) became publicly traded companies in the summer.|2020-11-16 10:28:42

People are terrified of this vaccine and Facebook will make loads of money from dictators seeking to use that to destabilize democracies.

chmwuj|jv52hs|jv52hs|3|I’m a biased NIO bull with more riding on leaps than a few weekly FDs. This PM action doesn’t phase me. Whether a continuation of a sell off over one short sellers opinion or the “healthy” pullback that’s touted as needed doesn’t change the fact that numbers should be good for ER and the sudden hit targeting NIO alone should indicate that.   Advice for today for others would be to average down and possibly move out to 11/27. I’m keeping my 11/20s because this drop we’re seeing now has had equally high spikes during the last 2 weeks.   Or I’m wrong and somehow one person made millions sell at a loss because he said to lol.|2020-11-16 06:35:17

cic9x4|jv52hs|jv52hs|3|Lots of people looking at the potential of jumping in to Pharma on the back of vaccine news. This is a classic case of people buying the news, rather than what is really facing the industry.

People here are probably too retarded to understand but below is a good summary of what he is trying to do  [https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biden-looks-to-germany-for-answers-how-to-tackle-high-u-s-drug-prices-analyst](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biden-looks-to-germany-for-answers-how-to-tackle-high-u-s-drug-prices-analyst)  Someone much smarter than me would research which companies are heavily exposed specifically to "primary care" keep tracks on the news of how this is progressing, and take a position to short them.|2020-11-16 10:41:23

You make it easier to get into colleges for black people with affirmative action and you give them preferential treatment.   I'm all for anti racist movements but don't give them preferential treatment like this. That's why there are black people that think they're entitled.   Why do you think some people are racist towards black people? It's because government creates reasons like that. No black person has ever asked for pity or preferential treatment. They just want **equality not more.**  I'm Asian but if I were black, I'd be pissed not thankful. Maybe happy in the short-term because you get your loans forgiven but the concept of preferential treatment is messed up. Why do you make it easier to get into college for black people? That's like broadly saying that black people are intellectually inferior. If you want to promote equality, then treat all people the same. Am I wrong or what?|2020-11-16 14:48:30

Now they're in the money. If I let them get assigned I think based on the premiums I'll break even overall, but the other option is to roll them out to June at a 45 strike, for basically a wash. If they get assigned at 45 I'm ahead. If they expire OTM but above current levels I'd also be happy. If it goes back down again I'll be unhaps. Thoughts?|2020-11-16 13:53:57

cil907|jv52hs|jv52hs|1|Why is nobody talking about Twitter? This is the most undervalued tech company of our time. Great user growth recently and bigger upside potential than any other social media today, by far. Twitter is used by professionals and the primary social media source of many celebrities and highly respected people (it's not just Trump, but yes, our president) and becoming more and more relevant by the day. Twitter is a totally unique social media and people use Twitter for more than just interacting with their friends, it's a source for news, politics, sports, interests and even community. As everything moves more and more online, Twitter has the business model of the future, it is a source for pretty much everything, like Facebook, only 23x less the valuation (as of now).  SNAP and PINS which have a similar mkt cap are up over 200% the past 12 months off relatively minor increased guidance. Meanwhile, Twitter has barely moved outside of its typical range of volatility, though it is on the verge of a breakout which I think will be similar to what we saw with Snap and Pinterest. Aside from user growth, which is bound to explode any time, once they figure out how to optimize their advertising (which is just a mess right now), their revenue will increase exponentially and so will the stock price.  TL;DR: YOLOing $500k into TWTR $90-100c 1/2022 leaps because there is very little downside and ridiculous upside in plain sight|2020-11-16 11:52:35

However this brings about a long term and short term opportunity for the truly retarded. Guns and ammo have been flying off of the shelves. Most places still have the 2 box per customer policy. Supply vs demand. People aren't turning in their guns anytime soon. When biden gets in and starts mucking the gun trade up it seems to me like trying to find a bottom and holding massive shares and waiting. Thoughts? (Calls are to risky because of decay and low volume. I also would rather buy as much as I can and not in 100 blocks) so buy low.

cinq8o|jv52hs|jv52hs|-7|hey, arr / investing!! So, anyways I just inherited about $10 billion dollars from my deceased grandfather (he invented the car). My gf and I (and our furbabies, I suppose) have an annual income of about $100 million (she's a doctor/lawyer for a major pharma company and I'm a pro athlete). We live very frugally and have about 1 billion in our savings account prior to our inheritance. We were thinking about investing in bonds (the safe choice), but were wondering if there are any other ways to possible generate 100% safe income with our new found money?|2020-11-16 12:11:53

ciwwim|jv52hs|jv52hs|-15|Why is nobody talking about Twitter? This is the most undervalued tech company of our time. Great user growth recently and bigger upside potential than any other social media today, by far. Twitter is used by professionals and the primary social media source of many celebrities and highly respected people (it's not just Trump, but yes, our president) and becoming more and more relevant by the day. Twitter is a totally unique social media and people use Twitter for more than just interacting with their friends, it's a source for news, politics, sports, interests and even community. As everything moves more and more online, Twitter has the business model of the future, it is a source for pretty much everything, like Facebook, only 23x less the valuation (as of now).  SNAP and PINS which have a similar mkt cap are up over 200% the past 12 months off relatively minor increased guidance. Meanwhile, Twitter has barely moved outside of its typical range of volatility, though it is on the verge of a breakout which I think will be similar to what we saw with Snap and Pinterest. Aside from user growth, which is bound to explode any time, once they figure out how to optimize their advertising (which is just a mess right now), their revenue will increase exponentially and so will the stock price.  TL;DR: YOLOing $500k into TWTR $90-100c 1/2022 leaps because there is very little downside and ridiculous upside in plain sight|2020-11-16 13:22:23
