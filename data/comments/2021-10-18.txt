h4g4fq|qajk42|qajk42|3|AXSM reversing higher after foolish selloff to start the day. Company announced increase in credit line and ignorants sold it down nearly three  bucks not realizing the significance of the news.     AXSM last week listed multiple postings for account managers for their AXS 05 drug that has not yet been approved by the FDA. So why hire? Because it's pretty much expected the approval to come in soon. The increase in the credit line is most certainly for marketing, production and all the expenses associated with rolling out a multi billion dollar blockbuster drug.     This opportunity will not be around forever. Approval of AXS 05 may well launch AXSM deep towards the high ranges of analyst targets, which is above $150. That's right, this stock is probably a 4X gainer, which is why I bought more today on the dip just after the open.     Good luck folks, I'm long shares.|2021-10-18 11:14:05

h3nm3v|qajk42|qajk42|-1|I still think UPST is going to rally up to $480-500 before it retraces 40-50% but that's just TA crayons on a chart.  In these types of crazy vertical rallies you get sharper up moves and pullbacks before it fails.  i.e. The action sees bigger swings in both directions in the finale of a blowoff top.  Just basing that off what previous moves look like such as last year's TSLA/EVs/Battery stock rallies.  My advice is not to try to play downside until RSI on UPST completely fails to hold over 75-80.  First couple big dips typically see a lot of buying in the 2nd leg of a rally.|2021-10-18 07:33:24

But I‚Äôd still work and my life would remain relatively unchanged.  1 million would make my life great. I‚Äôd have what I‚Äôve always wanted. Comfort.

h51plk|qajk42|qajk42|0|AXSM taking a breather today. Just south of flat on the day after that monster eight point week off the $32 level.  The news is still trending great for the company. They placed ads for account managers to handle the rollout of the much anticipated FDA approval of AXS 05, which should come at any time now to January. That's gives folks ample opportunity to get in on this expected 4X return on cash or 8X on margin.  Company also today announced an increase to their credit line, most likely related to expenses for the rollout.  When this stock gets approval it should surge. And I mean SURGE higher. We already closed above and held $35. The blasted right off  to $40. Expect to see $50 way before next month options. And fahgettabahtit when the approval comes in. No stopping until $100 and beyond.  Good luck.  Long shares.|2021-10-18 13:41:47
