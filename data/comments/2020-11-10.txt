Great news on the vaccine efficacy from the company report, but it’s not all good - it requires two doses, with no news at all yet on how long it’s effective for. Assuming it’s longer than a month, it then needs national (and global) rollout including constant storage at -75c along the entire supply chain. That’s a specialist lab freezer. Your Westinghouse does -18c (0F). This is all assuming that people are actually going to take it. We aren’t out of the woods on this by a fucking long shot.|2020-11-10 08:37:11

btgzr5|jriieh|jriieh|18|AAPL is a great stock. But, people have unrealistic expectations thanks to 2020. After the PE expansion AAPL is not going to double in one year again.   AAPL PE went from literally 10 in 2016 to 35 today. Explains how they grew EPS 50% yet price grew about 400%.  AAPL PE is not going to go from 35 to 70 and it will take at least 5 years at their current growth rate to double EPS unless black magic happens.  AAPL won't rocket, it's going to be climbing the stairs. You're better off with the mid-caps for rocket potential, or get lucky with 0DTE.|2020-11-10 05:31:39

bupoot|jriieh|jriieh|4|Stuck in-between a rock and a hard place.  Currently trying to move from contracting to a more stable job (target) paying much less without any of the traveling hassle...  Contracting is $295 a day and generally can be a week to two weeks out of town at a time.  Target isn$15 an hour and essentially pays Less than my contract hourly up to 12 hrs.   That being said I have medical conditions that get neglected when I'm traveling and I also want to go back to school. If I knock the seasonal gig out of the park I could be more stable than if I hustle this last contracting gig before runoffs - things will slow down after and I don't know if the cash flow will be as reliable..  Go from $35 an hour to $15 an hour for long term stability or risk it for a $3000 week here starting Thursday.  Currently sitting in target orientation weighing my options... I have virtually 0 debt but yeah.  Edit: $SPY $360 01/21|2020-11-10 12:31:54

Their still growing middle class is larger than our entire population so they'll be consuming their own tech at a scale never before seen without having to rely on external markets. They're also the most ambitious nation in renewable energy initiatives cause strategically they don't want to be energy dependent on other nations, and they want to reverse poor health endemic due to their unprecedented industrial/economic growth that caused immense pollution these last couple decades.   China is the new overlord. The sooner you stop fighting the inevitable and get with the program, the sooner you can stop being poor and lead a life of luxury.

buyugf|jriieh|jriieh|6|A lot of Y’all really don’t understand trends, TA, or other markets. So many people in this thread saying “why are we down?” Or “what caused the dip?”.   I’ve been telling people to hedge, or take profits, or better yet buy puts. Because what’s happening right now makes sense to me. Credit market is falling, millions of foreclosures/mortgage defaults looming, QE gives banks reserve cash to lend against but they aren’t lending thus drying up liquidity, the dollar is going to experience deflation until we get more stimulus, interest rates at all time lows. Not to mention that the current equity market is showing all the hallmarks of a bubble. I mean fuck I even anticipated that we would rise after the election, that still fit within my outlook. And I’m not typing this to make it seem like I know exactly how the market will move because I don’t, but long term trends are relatively easy to predict when you look into all the available information.   We will likely retest 320 before December. Whether we keep going lower or bounce up I don’t know. But please stop chasing 3-day trends and then freakout when a predictable reversal happens.|2020-11-10 13:43:01

btfh2f|jriieh|jriieh|6|Iv'e had puts on BYND meat for a while now but I'm no averse to kicking a dog company while its on the mat and down 20+% with more to go. 70$ by next week hopefully!!!   BYND Meat short thesis summary:  The company is in a low margin industry with competition from much  larger players rapidly increasing. The product sector is over saturated  with similar offerings all competing for the same consumer. This is one  reason why their margins are decreasing - see SEC quarterly report. The  company has little prospect of larger deals now as McDonalds is now  selling the McPlant independently - see recent news articles. If you  read my previous posts you will see that I said that this is exactly  what they would do - develop their own product without the need to pay  BYND.  Beyond Meat is losing money ( has negative  income ) and is also increasingly cash flow negative (it is losing money  in its everyday operations at a incerasing rate). It's revenue growth -  the only hope that supporters have - is clearly slowing down quarter on  quarter - see recent quarterly reports. This is nothing short of a  complete disaster for a company that share price has 'priced-in'  accelerating and not decelerating revenue growth. Remember that the  company is not sustainable in terms of its operating income at current  low revenues - it likely can't make a consistent profit if revenues do  not dramatically increase to achieve higher net margins and economies of  scale.  Its debt is slowly increasing and has cash  of around $215m as of its most recent filing. In order to remain  competitive it will need to invest in factories (to reach sustainable  economies of scale) and 215$ million is not nearly enough to do so. It  will be forced to do a capital raise at some point  and dilute  shareholders further - it can't invest in revenue growth and production  capacity without doing so . At the same time it will need to continue to  burn cash in cost of goods sold - namely advertising and marketing  expenses. Look at the reports - the hype the product has costs a lot of  money to maintain. Some argue the product hype around the Beyond Burger  is the only advantage the product has.   I could go  on and say that the impossible burger is more favoured in taste by  consumers and has better financing behind it in terms of investors like  Bill Gates and so on. Or I could mention that Lab Meat is a serious long  term threat to beyond as it actually tastes like meat (it basically is  synthetic meat) and Lab based meat companies have just listed on the  stock exchange (an Israeli company) and they a combination of Plant and  Lab based meat will likely be the future of real meat alternatives  anyway. But honestly if you have read up to here and you are still  considering holding BYND meat after today's awful news then I seriously  doubt you are thinking clearly and nothing will convince you not to buy  this horrible company. You probably bought Nikola and are still hoping  to get your money back on that. For your own sake stop being so naive.|2020-11-10 05:04:43

buryin|jriieh|jriieh|2|I'm considering a 30K loan for 5 yrs at 10.2% interest to trade stocks and other derivatives. The monthly payments would be at around $650 with no prepayment fee so I can funnel my profits into the loan and decrease the principal.   I currently have no other debt and no bills. I figure instead of paying "rent" I can pay the $650 but also have a shot at gaining equity. Its an investment on myself. I am confident in my abilities.   Note: if things went south, I would have no issues making the monthly payments.   Any thoughts friends?|2020-11-10 12:49:12

GM actually has a very good EV and autonomous driving division.  Nio market cap is worth more than GM now even though GM actually sells millions of more cars and has way more revenue.  Even accounting for GM's debt and pension obligations, its book value is worth way more than Nio.

btz7y4|jriieh|jriieh|-5|Lmaooo all these companies investing so much into battery / electric. Let me break something down for yall  1.  Tesla's profits have been solely due to green subsidies. The government creates artificial demand  for "green" products that the market does not even want yet. With out tax dollars funding these companies they wouldnt exist.   2. Lifetime output of CO2 from tesla (from production to death) is the same as a the output from a gas vehicle  3. Only tangible advantage of electric is cheaper electricity vs gas, which will be offset once batteries dominate the market as increased demand for coal powered electricity will increase prices.  So no environmental benefits and not much financial benefits- maybe lower maintenance cost will one day be the only selling point. The end point here is that people believe theres all this demand and hype for EV when it is just artificial demand created through government subsidies. There really isnt much incentive to go EV unless youre just a fan of electric lol.  $F thinks this last minute ditch into EV will save them. Lol. Puts|2020-11-10 09:02:27
