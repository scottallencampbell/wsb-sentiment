I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Jerome Powell, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Jerome Powell put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.|2019-07-31 07:35:21

Last summer the  FDA  concluded that the planet-based ingredient was safe to eat, but federal regulations required a separate application for the ingredient to be used as a food coloring additive.  **Impossible Foods  said that soy leghemoglobin gives the company's plant-based products the taste of real meat.**  A new competitor has entered the market.|2019-07-31 09:58:05

vksn2b|ck6zrp|ck6zrp|5|Bears - realtalk. I'm holding some puts myself because I accidentally triggered PDT and if I lose it all it's just a drop in the ocean of losses anyway. About 5 grand worth.  &#x200B;  So far in 2019 we had **140 trading days.**  SPY **dropped 1% or more only on 7 days.**  Two of those were in January - post December jitters.  Four of those in May - new round of tariffs on China.  One in March - 22nd, fuck knows why, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast yesterday.  Basically what I'm saying is that most likely SPY will settle above 301, I will lose reminder of my money, and bulls will win.

Not bad given I rolled to these with credit from previous AMD dip. * Good gains with INTC Oct puts for about 35%. Left another 10% on table but can't time it all. Dumped half of my 2020 puts. * Scalped some EA puts as it faded, covered all my losses and held my Jan $80p which I doubled down on. Down only 20% on them and can exit at break even thanks to those scalps. But gonna hold. * Rolled and covered ATVI shares at the top, bought some put hedge as it flirted with $50, took quick 20% profit as Jpow did his thing. * Scalped V calls during oversold and bailed before selling resumed. * MU got ass blasted but over half of my shares are at $33 and I sold ITM $44 Jan calls when underlying was at $47 so got good protection today.

vkejo8|ck6zrp|ck6zrp|2|[CNBC: Apple proves that buybacks are effective](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/31/santoli-apples-gains-are-largely-the-product-of-buyback-financial-engineering.html)     The net income of the company has basically stayed flat over the past 4 years, but the stock price has doubled in that same time period. Thoughts? I think that if they're basically done growing, they would've been better served in the long term to transform into a high dividend company.|2019-07-31 08:38:35

vme30a|ck6zrp|ck6zrp|2|Update on my Merrill Edge debacle:  (quick recap)  I placed an order for MSFT 8/9 139Cs and 8/2 138Cs 30 mins before close and FIT 8/9 5Cs.    They kept on failing to execute, so I eventually set them to MARKET. Still fail. I called in and by that time it was market close, they claimed "there was no liquidity".      ("making me whole")  They then called me back and they said they'd make me whole. I said "uhh, I don't want to be made whole again, changed my mind" (was looking at how much FIT dropped, and I cancelled the unfulfilled order online). They eventually said, well you submitted it at market so we have to make you whole, at whatever the price was at close. But I don't want to be made whole I just want to keep my $! Can they do this?!.      I mean, I think the MSFT 139C/138Cs will be fine, but those 100x FIT will be worthless!!!!|2019-07-31 15:59:28

Because in a week everyone will have forgotten what he even said, and it'll be irrelevant because this fucker gives speeches once every 2-3 weeks anyway.

vkya4y|ck6zrp|ck6zrp|2|After the last round of earnings plays a couple of months ago, I got disgusted with my losses and disabled options on my Robinhood account.  Now, if I think some stonk is going up, I'm forced to spend thousands and buy a good chunk of it - this makes me think whether it is really worth it, and there are also logistics involved with transfers > 1000 (instant settlement limits).  So, I (1) have to get into long positions and thus think whether I want to hold something for a reasonable period of time (2) can't impulse buy random shit (3) can't throw away money on options that are "just a few hundred" and (4) if a long position goes south, I can just sigh and hold it for an year or two (5) can't buy random puts on every fucking stock  I think this is good for me, and I'd recommend my fellow autists to try it - not having options forces you to make better decisions. I have been tempted to reenable options a few times, but it takes a day, and my impulses die down by then.  I reckon I have saved a couple of thousands at least by not having options a couple of months. I actually made some gains by buying stocks like MSFT, AAPL, INTC|2019-07-31 10:47:37
