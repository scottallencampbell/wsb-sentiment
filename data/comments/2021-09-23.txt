dzf2ll|ptrwt2|ptrwt2|12|**Reason why $SPY will always go up**  Main requirement to join the S&P 500:  >last reported quarter must be profitable ✅  >aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅  Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.  Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!  Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!  SPY adjusts to the economy constantly, it always follows profits.    #$SPY 600c DEC 15 2023  100 call leaps purchased on July 21 for $330 are still up even after September dips to $427 which is $9k profit https://i.imgur.com/HymUpFm.png  ***Buy the dip.

dzx49g|ptrwt2|ptrwt2|5|So IRNT filed an S-1 today, which means the PIPE is unlocked and PIPE investors are probably dumping shares as we speak.   https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001777946/000119312521279697/d207573ds1.htm   Why does this matter? Basically every SPAC gets absolutely obliterated when the PIPE comes online, because the float increases massively and there is a ton of selling pressure from the PIPE investors. But this is going to be particularly bad with IRNT because the entire stock pumped hard because it was the lowest float ticker with options. With the pipe unlock, the float is now 500%+ larger, which means IV is going to get crushed and anyone smart who was longing is going to get out.   Who knows where any stock will move but if you were long I'd consider getting out.|2021-09-23 13:54:22

Talking on the phone with TDA "so in theory, I couldve just opened the inverse of my position infinity times, exercised the long end and made 44 bucks a spread with 0 risk?

No master, no pen, no prison... she is free.  The gay bears can never catch her as she is too fast, too cunning, too wild.

True success is a series of consistent swings, most resulting in base hits and some lucky ones hitting the sweet spot and going yard.

dyulcb|ptrwt2|ptrwt2|2|All the other FOMC members are more hawkish than Powell. His soothing voice is the only thing holding this thing up.  &#x200B;  "Financial markets took one look at the Federal Reserve’s pronouncements on Wednesday, saw nothing disconcerting, and turned their attention to other matters.   They might want to take a second look, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.   Digging into the details of the Fed’s projections and dot plot suggests more people within the Fed are concerned inflation will become a larger problem in 2022, Swonk wrote to her clients.   Fed Chairman Jerome Powell “is a dove among hawks,” Swonk wrote in her essay entitled “Hawks Rule the Roost.”   Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, agreed: “it is hard to characterize today’s FOMC meeting as anything other than hawkish.”   The Fed appeared to be more willing to raise its benchmark interest rate more aggressively than before."|2021-09-23 09:27:40

e09nxg|ptrwt2|ptrwt2|3|I just had an idea for a different kind of "margin" account and I'm curious if anyone would be interested in it.  Here's the deal: you trade in a virtual portfolio with the firm's money backed by a 50% deposit from yourself, and instead of paying interest on the other borrowed half, 80% of your gains and 90% of your losses are applied to your deposit balance. No credit check or minimum deposit since it's not actual margin as in borrowed money, it's more like the firm using your money as insurance for following your trading instructions with their money. If your trades lose 111% then you hit zero and they get to keep your initial deposit to make up for the money they lost by matching you, if your trades make money the firm gets to keep about 10% of the gains and pay for the 10% reduction in losses for those who lose money.  This 90% vs 80% thing basically means you need to consistently make a lot more than you lose in order to actually break even, but margin interest does the same thing normally to an extent without the advantage that you can go all in on something with twice as much money as you deposited and if it goes to 0 you'll only be down 90% instead of in debt.  Do you think it's a good idea? Have I made some kind of retarded math mistake that made me think this is a profitable win win when it's just stupid? Would a very different set of percentages make it more appealing to you instead of 80/90?|2021-09-23 15:27:21

e0ixe3|ptrwt2|ptrwt2|2|I really fucking hate to agree with the apes on anything, but I actually think SDC is a play. I've been following it for months and laughing at the apes, but I actually went big on calls today.  Shit is down like 75% since IPO, but their business is actually pretty okay (and they are expanding to Europe).  Price action is bottoming out pretty hard, I really don't think it can go any lower than $5 or so. Shorting is gonna end because theres just no meat left on the bone.   The price is just so fucking low that calls will just print absurd cash if SDC does anything other than getting  delisted, which I don't think it will.  Anyway, I guess I am aligned with the apes now. May God have mercy on my soul.  Edit: also some hotshot analyst downgraded them today, which in my experience, is always the catalyst for a bullish reversal.|2021-09-23 16:34:02

dzwnho|ptrwt2|ptrwt2|1|Had a move in the ten year early to mid February from 1.0 to 1.3% that sparked a sell off in high multiple names like what is in it ARKK. Yield topped out around 1.7 mid March before heading back down. ARKK didn’t find a bottom until may 6th.   Fed said they’re going to start tapering in November. Yields should continue to go up. The same type of move gets us to around 2.0%. But who knows, this is all known info so it’s probably priced in. Either that or the market is retarded and doesn’t take into account the obvious.  Buying puts because I think the second option is correct, the market is retarded. Also very bad at this game, and do not know anything. I doubt the Fed ever actually tapers.|2021-09-23 13:51:08
