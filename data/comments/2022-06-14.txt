Of course, these movies only tell stories of spectacular failure and I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of times that the institutions *do* act quickly enough to stave off catastrophe.

When CPI starts falling.   IMO it‚Äôs really that simple. If you‚Äôre buying now you‚Äôre probably early on most names but much closer to a bottom than top.  If we believe the terminal rate is around 4% and will be reached around spring of 23, then the market is likely going to bottom six months before that, or around October. This is the overall market I‚Äôm talking about. Some names look like they‚Äôve already bottomed, which makes sense since they topped about six months ahead of the rest of the market ($ZM for example).  What would change my mind would be a spike in short term yields or an inversion between 3 month and 10 year bonds. The fact that we haven‚Äôt had anything close to that is the main reason I still don‚Äôt buy the recession narrative and believe a soft landing is still the most likely outcome.  Another thing that would change my mind is if CPI started topping out much sooner than expected which would likely drop the terminal rate and bring it into 22.|2022-06-14 12:23:55

Am I wrong thinking now is the point where it just keeps drilling as to not let to many in on the buss? I'm thinking a bounce will come much later, maybe end of next week.  If we bounce today/tomorrow, I'm much more inclined to believe it will be a full on final Bear-Rally to wipe out Bears thinking they had an easy entry while also getting every last bull possible onboard for the slaughter. If so, I also expect such a Bear-Rally not to slowly taper of, but violently drop out of absolutely nowhere. No numbers, no reports, just some random ass day.  Another possibility is we rally hard going into the weekend,   with market closed Monday 20'th giving funds and banks 3 whole day to cook their books and get all their shit ready to harvest the market.  My only real fear is for the market to do the absolutely most unpredictable and nonsensical move possible:    **We go into an actual Bull-market from here for the rest of 2022**|2022-06-14 07:00:14

cdhgrg|vc0089|vc0089|7|It will be 75 bps. Why?  Mainly, JPOW is one of the most political FED chairmen, well, ever. The "reputation of the Fed" is at risk, and the market is pretty much (IMO) ready for 75 bps.   HOWEVER... It is not all about the market and about rates. OIL continues to go up, regardless. That, to me, is as big of an issue.   A balanced policy would involve proper rate management , more oil production in the US  and incentives for EVs with more charging stations. None of those have happened. Elected officials for both US countries are too busy trying to keep their job.|2022-06-14 15:39:57

The Bull refuse to abandon ship even as it sinks to the bottom, and the Bear is already exhausted from jumping overboard way to early and drowns also.  **The moral of the story is that the Bears were right in the end, Bulls had a way better time, they both lost and fucking died, and the only winner was whoever sold them  the raft.**|2022-06-14 05:51:26

cble2i|vc0089|vc0089|4|If you're looking for where a short-term bottom signal should be, look at JNK (the high yield bond ETF).  It basically crashed below the May lows over the past 3 trading sessions and is now starting to approach the Covid crash and 2008 lows.  When (I think it's almost guaranteed to happen now) JNK currently at 90 goes below the Covid crash lows of 83, I think that's probably where we see a short-term bottom.  If JNK dips below 80 (which is where it was around the bottom of the 2008-2009 financial crisis), I think you have to close all shorts and put in a lot of long exposure.  I think things will start to break down in financial markets if conditions get that tight and the Fed will be forced to halt tightening to prevent a much harsher recession.  Even if the result is >4% inflation for years, Fed will stop tightening if bond markets start to fall apart (just my opinion).|2022-06-14 07:31:32

The agency said in a separate report last week that it had documented more than 200 crashes involving Teslas that were using Autopilot, ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving,‚Äù Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or some other of the company‚Äôs partially automated systems.  Tesla‚Äôs figure and its crash rate per 1,000 vehicles was substantially higher than the corresponding numbers for other automakers that provided such data to The Associated Press ahead of NHTSA‚Äôs release. The number of Tesla collisions was revealed as part of a NHTSA investigation of Teslas on Autopilot that had crashed into emergency and other vehicles stopped along roadways.|2022-06-14 13:51:18

ccblzm|vc0089|vc0089|10|The most unsettling thing about this situation is that it is self evident that the fed has absolutely no idea what they are doing and are simply doing whatever they think the majority wants them to do in every meeting.  I believe they will hike 75 tomorrow. Is that because they think that‚Äôs the correct amount to slow inflation while not wrecking the economy based on their collective decades of experience? Of course not! It‚Äôs because most of the media has voiced that‚Äôs what they should do. Nevermind that Powell himself said just a few weeks ago 75 wasn‚Äôt something they were considering.  I dream of a day when an actual independent fed chair is appointed who is competent and isn‚Äôt worried about appeasing CNBC talking heads. This entire situation started because Powell was too much of a pussy to make his own decisions and not voice every single thought in his head 24/7. Some mystery with regard to the fed is a good thing. It would‚Äôve allowed them to stop QE and start hiking months earlier. Instead Powell had to make his dumbass ‚Äúnot thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates‚Äù comment which backed him into a corner with accommodative policy months after it was clear it wasn‚Äôt needed.

I think the market might be sniffing out that reality here that we might be due for a very brief relief rally today, because 75 tmrw is baked in, and that seems unlikely.|2022-06-14 06:58:15

cba73v|vc0089|vc0089|6|The biggest problem of the markets are still not listening to the fed 2020-2022. You start speculation the minute they‚Äôve announced what they will do! They‚Äôre trying to keep you calm by telegraphing their moves. Still you start speculating that maybe they won‚Äôt in either direction! Or maybe they will do ‚Äúthis wild theory instead‚Äù  Do not fight the fed. It‚Äôs stupid! Rate increases will keep coming in the current size they have telegraphed until we have more monthly data with lower inflation! Yes rates will be higher next year but unless you‚Äôre stupid shouldn‚Äôt affect you. If you have debt and didn‚Äôt lock in the best rates in forever you were stupid! If you don‚Äôt have debt you‚Äôre poor and unemployed! Get a job!   Right now it‚Äôs obvious! Core inflation has peaked but speculative energy and food prices still keep all items high! Rents increase is apparent too! Media then write inflation is going up when it‚Äôs actually already slightly coming down!   The whole reason fed uses core inflation is because energy and food is highly speculative and volatile price markets and sucks for long term trend calculus! Within a pandemic of 2+ years you‚Äôve gone from lowest gas prices in a decade to highest! That‚Äôs volatile. Speculative oil price even turned negative! Producers had to pay to give barrels away! It never ever within these years signaled anything about the state of the economy! It‚Äôs insanely stupid because opec has held huge oil reserves to force oil prices higher after the price war with Russia in 2020 that collapsed oil with them playing a chicken race on who could pump the oil the fastest! Never ever have we been anywhere near a real supply issue in oil. You can‚Äôt pump more than you can store if you have a supply issue! What countries have fallen for however is the power and greed of opec+. They‚Äôre milking the increased demand of energy masterfully, since that chicken race and political negotiators in the world sucks because they‚Äôre not looking for other suppliers in South America when the Arabs are fucking with them!  USA also wins on this war with Russia as Europe have already signed deals on huge oil exports from US to Europe import at a really strong dollar!  How you can whine about the economy when the US is winning and is in the best seat possible right now in the worlds macroeconomic situation is beyond me. Only a poor and unemployed person can!   Europe, China and Russia is in a way worse situation than US is but still Americans whine the most right now! It‚Äôs hilarious!|2022-06-14 05:23:45

ccb266|vc0089|vc0089|3|I think the US should have a national oil company despite how communist and anti-capitalist it is. Hear me out, oil is a product of vital national security. Our oil companies have made it clear that no matter how high prices go, they will not drill more in part due to policies that make it very expensive to do so and in part because they want to milk this high profit environment for as long as they can. They know oil is a dying industry over the long term and this may be their last hurrah.    The government needs the ability to bring down oil prices in an emergency and the only way to do so is by bringing out more supply. We have the strategic oil reserve but clearly that's not enough. If we cant convince oil companies to do it and we cant convince opec to do it then we have to have the ability to do it ourselves.  I know that it's not just crude oil production that's the issue, it's also oil refining capacity so I think the US government should operate both at a very small scale so that they don't truly compete with oil companies but still have the ability to scale up or down oil production.|2022-06-14 10:50:11

cb96n5|vc0089|vc0089|1|**PPI?**  Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.|2022-06-14 05:09:41

But the cost of steel, chicken, transportation, autos and parts also rose.   The increase in wholesale prices over the past 12 months slowed to 10.8% from 10.9%, the government said Tuesday. Just a year and a half ago, prices were rising at a less than 2% pace.  So-called core wholesale prices, which omit food and energy, rose 0.5% in May. Wall Street had expected a 0.5% increase.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe cost of wholesale goods and services jumped 0.8% in May and added to mounting evidence that the highest U.S. inflation in 40 years will persist through the summer.

cbr4w6|vc0089|vc0089|-5|Guys the core inflation is going down! Not by much but 2 reports have confirmed it!   Yearly avg is going down!  Monthly (increase) a positive number still means that month had inflation. A negative number is deflation. But the system is meant to always have 2% yearly inflation, that is the target inflation.   Right now there is no data pointing to that yearly avgs are going up in regards to core! All items avg is up because there is still a speculative bubble in commodities like oil, natural gas, wheat, corn etc.  Ppi just told the same story as CPI|2022-06-14 08:22:45

ccw5mt|vc0089|vc0089|-12|Guys I am actually trying to help you. Markets are retesting pre covid highs! I said they would in 2021! I also bought and called the bottom of 2020!   What is happening now is that global equites have corrected but for instance US from irrational exuberance and London UK from rational slow recovery!   Now is NOT the time to stay bearish, it isn‚Äôt either the time to scream ath eoy. It is the time to trust the global economy and buy long PLAYS! Also use DCA to not go all in too soon!   The most likely scenario is that whichever way global equity markets have found themselves at the same price points they will soon start going the same way! If you want to PUT the global economy up to you, but don‚Äôt be so damn US centric. Everybody is in the same real economic boat!|2022-06-14 13:12:52

That people and businesses that locked in ludicrous APR rates on their homes and businesses ( sub 2.3 APR ), is basically free money *in the future*.   What does that mean? I believe it mean that after this relatively short recession we are going to have one final, all powerful wave up on all investable asset classes. Once we reach THAT top ( because of the previous sub 2.3 loans ) THEN everyone will be fully tapped out. Then a REAL liquidity crises happens because literally everyone will be tapped dry. Only demand that will have any liquidity will be governments. At that point, it's their move.
