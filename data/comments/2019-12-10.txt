Further into next year, when more is known about trade, the Fed and ECB will be more in play. That's my response to the QOTD.   For now, messaging from Powell and Lagarde will almost certainly be consistent with what we’ve heard already. Lagarde will emphasize the appropriateness of current monetary policy and will probably reiterate her call for additional fiscal help from EU governments. From Powell, expect the on-hold messaging in recent communications to feature in tomorrow’s statement and presser. He will reiterate the robustness of the U.S. economy, and also highlight the downside risks.   With nothing new from the Fed and ECB, the market’s focus will be on trade. This has been the case for the past weeks and months, and won’t change this week.|2019-12-10 06:04:42

He announces tariffs now/tonight to get fed to be more dovish tomorrow 3. He waits until sat to say tariffs are on cuz doesn't want market panic  Either way, this is getting kinda close... he'll have to announce soon but if he doesn't by Thursday guarantee some big bois are gonna start offloading stocks to hedge for the situation in which he does increase tariffs. I'm sure someone has told him this (not to cut it so close), so why is he still waiting? IMO if he doesn't announce by EOD tomorrow tariffs probably happening.

Beijing sees the removal of the Dec. 15 threat enabling talks to continue on the unfinished items in phase-one of the accord, two officials said on condition on anonymity because the conversations are private.

aec8zb|e8p94h|e8p94h|5|>**It Seems Donald Trump Agrees With the ‘WarGames’ WOPR: Macro Man**   >   >By Cameron Crise   >   >(Bloomberg) --    >   >For all of the event risk we’ve got this week and into the end of the year, the elephant that remains in the dealing room is the fate of the tariffs. While game theory often gets thrown around in the context of market scenario analysis, this time it’s actually appropriate as you consider what Donald Trump will decide. A couple of years ago we heard that trade wars were “good” and “easy to win.” Perhaps the president has been watching the early-80s classic “WarGames” on Air Force One, however, as the latest leak suggests that he’s decided not to escalate the trade war for the time being.   >   >Despite a busy calendar this week, including U.S. CPI, Fed and ECB meetings, and the U.K. election, it’s hard to escape the obvious conclusion that many financial assets are simply waiting on news on the tariffs scheduled to go into effect over the weekend. That’s hardly a breathtaking insight, but there are a few interesting features of the set-up that add some spice to how you need to think about things.   >   >Chief among them is of course the negotiating tactics of the president. There’s a popular belief that he doesn’t want to derail the stock market heading into an election year, and that is certainly understandable. An alternative approach might be to spend some of this year’s tasty 25% gain by implementing the tariffs this weekend and then kickstart a rally next year by waiving them in January or February as part of a phase one deal. John von Neumann would approve.   >   >The latest leaks, however, suggest that the obvious middle ground solution may also be the most likely-- a delay in the tariffs pending the outcome of future negotiations. For the game theorists and scenario planners out there, this hearkens back to the WOPR computer in WarGames, which after simulating multiple iterations of global nuclear war concludes that the only winning move is not to play. A key question in the event of a deferral is whether the implementation date is moved (providing another defined event risk) or left open-ended, which would expose markets to a 6pm tweet-quake on some random Thursday early next year.   >   >We’ve seen leaks before that end up being contradicted, so some circumspection probably remains in order. After all, a weekend decision (one way or another) implies jump risk when markets start trading again next week, and no one wants to be on the wrong side of a step up or down in pricing. A VIX of 15 or 16 looks elevated relative to recent realized volatility but is hardly excessive given the underlying uncertainty. The SPX 3135 straddle expiring on Dec. 20 is priced at roughly 53.5 points at the time of writing, giving breakevens of 3081.5 and 3188.5. Somehow the lower price seems closer, doesn’t it?   >   >Regardless of what markets think should, or even will happen, there’s likely to be something of an options decay payoff profile from owning risky assets this week. The longer we go without confirmation one way or another, the stronger the impulse will be to de-risk juuuuuuust in case. Of course, the other event risks over the next few days will also play their part in determining short-term price action; perhaps someone should send a “War Games” VHS tape to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue just in case.   >   >NOTE: Cameron Crise is a macro strategist who writes for Bloomberg.

ae3q7q|e8p94h|e8p94h|4|>**Impeachment Headlines Won't Shift Markets Unless Senate Buckles**   >   >By Eddie van der Walt   >   >(Bloomberg) -- **Impeachment headlines are nothing but noise from a markets perspective** as long as the Senate stands ready to acquit President Donald Trump. That was reflected in a lack of volatility in the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index and in global stock indexes as Democrats announced two articlesagainst the president.   >   >Traders won't care about any of this right up until they have to. The charges are coming from the House of Representatives, which is controlled by the Democrats, but the trial will take place in the Senate, where Republicans hold sway. You can expect markets to react if it looks as if Trump may be removed from office because he's losing GOP support. That has yet to happen. But if it does, the impeachment process would start influencing the policy outlook, and thus become a market theme rather than pure political maneuvering.   >   >Looking historically, the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton's in the middle of the 1990's dotcom boom didn't lead to a sell-off. In fact, the S&P 500 and MSCI ACWI both climbed during his trial. During the events leading up to Richard Nixon's resignation in the early 1970s, volatility across markets was higher, but there were other issues weighing on markets, including U.S. stagflation and an oil embargo.|2019-12-10 09:50:45

ae8jcs|e8p94h|e8p94h|4|Did some DD, actually read through a buncha articles. Idk man, sounds crazy, but I'm going to get some calls and shares for GME earnings. They've revised down so hard in previous quarters, that it seems even the slightest bit of good news should give them a good pump. Also their new CEO, has been restructuring heavily, they laid off 14% of their corporate staff, as well as cut many other costs. They have also optimized their storefronts and already have closed the ones that are underperforming. Let's also not forget that this last Black Friday was one of the biggest Black Fridays we've ever had. The Nintendo switch set a record in sales. Can't really say where they all came from, but I'm sure this helped GME sales greatly as well.

aeeyg4|e8p94h|e8p94h|3|Tinfoil hat time. Impeachment is almost certain to fail once it reaches the Senate and therefore to have very little effect upon the stock market. There is only *one* wild card that's still on my radar, and that would be if (according to anonymous sources) Schiff is sitting on [smoking gun audio/video tapes](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-intelligence-committee-possession-video-audio-recordings-giuliani/story?id=67276448) of Trump and Guiliani, given to him by Lev Parnas. To my knowledge, there hasn't been any follow-up story since 11/24 to either confirm or deny the existence of these recordings. Parnas has been extremely eager to get a plea deal and to testify before Congress however, and there has been private meetings of the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee in just the past week, in which reporters were not allowed.     Without the existence of tapes, it makes no sense to me why the House would choose to 1: only do two articles of impeachment, specifically about Ukraine and 2: rush to get them done before Christmas. Because if they knew there was no chance of removal and it's all just a show for scoring political points with their base, they wouldn't need to hurry and get it done by Christmas, and they wouldn't go with just two articles when they could add a million bajillion articles for every perceived act of corruption.     This rumor of tapes, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff increases, and weird shit going on with liquidity as we approach the end of the year, means I'm not ready to give up on SPY puts just yet.|2019-12-10 11:39:48

ae0n89|e8p94h|e8p94h|1|look guys, its about you:  &#x200B;  >**Irrational Exuberance Can't Be Found Among Retail Investors**   >   >By Andrew Cinko   >   >(Bloomberg) -- **Irrational exuberance in American stocks? Quite the opposite, actually, as small investors appear to be feeling too skeptical to buy equities with both hands**.The latest indication of their trepidation is TD Ameritrade's monthly Investor Movement Index. It's at 5.17 for November, smack dab in the middle of its 0-10 point range. But given the short history of the index (since 2010), the other way to look at it is where the November reading falls compared to past levels: it's in the bottom third. The current level is also a far cry from the peak set in December 2017 when it hit 8.59, goosed by the just-passed tax cut plan, and right before the S&P 500 experienced a rapid 10% pullback.   >   >Money managers are tepid on stocks, too. The National Association of Active Investment Managers' weekly sentiment index is in the middle of this year's range at 77.8, and -- like the TD Ameritrade index -- is far below the December 2017 all-time high. Back then it reached 120, which suggested active money managers were leveraged long at the time.   >   >Both of those indications match up well with last week's bull-bear spread from the American Association of Individual Investors. At 2.59 it shows there's a nearly even split between bulls and bears in the survey. And that's nothing like the January 2018 reading when the spread hit a seven-year high of +44 in favor of the bulls.|2019-12-10 09:17:48
