gs3mpy|w2oyo1|w2oyo1|4|Elon Musk responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to plow my mom. "30 children is 30 children", he said as he continued to plow what was clearly the wrong woman. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already cumming. Fertile dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his prostate massager. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Linkedin profiles from University of Wyoming. He wouldn't stop salivating.  That is to say, Musk has his fingers in a lot of creampies. He makes sure his name is on all the birth certificates.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

gsubkf|w2oyo1|w2oyo1|6|Tin foil hat theory: institutions and big funds are providing exit liquidity and just positioning for the next leg down.  Especially after yesterday.  I think the Apple news and huge intraday downward reversal caught a bunch of them off guard, so it needs to be back up here so they can start hitting the exits before next week. Outflows on SPY and the Nasdaq have been higher than inflows, yet we are pumping at a ridiculous rate?  Multi-million dollar put sweeps have been hitting for all of the indices for 8/19 all week long going back to early last week.  Like consistent $10-15m sweeps on put positions.

gt7mxu|w2oyo1|w2oyo1|2|We're basically back to March-April where stocks were way more bullish on the economy than bonds.  Bonds still pricing in 30-40% chance of a 100bps rate hike this month and the Fed forcing the US into recession.  Stocks are basically saying no chance of a 100bps rate hike and Fed will stop hiking after September; soft landing seems likely.  I think bonds will end up right again, but who knows at this point; a lot harder to trade downside when there's this much dip buying at this point.  Wait until Sept-Oct for puts imo.|2022-07-19 13:27:35

Apparently you idiots think the bears want a marketcrash because they ARBITRARILY refuse to buy calls and want our puts to go in the money. Jesus Christ   Bears want the economy to temporarily crash to prevent longlasting and much more damaging inflation you absolute mongo's  There is zero reason to cheer on assets inflating even more. Bears are calling for rational monetary policy and a return to normal. The last 14 years was completely idiotic and unprecedented in history, something which you dont have the frame of mind to see   I know ignorance is bliss but this situation is a bit more complex than "woo line go up is good"|2022-07-19 12:34:41

gsbbqs|w2oyo1|w2oyo1|-2|Bull leaned back against the cold concrete wall, breathing heavily. His hands were sweaty and he could feel it running down the back of his fingers and trickling across the cold metal of his .45.  A shot rang out and the bullet impacted against the corner of the wall he was using as cover. He leaned around and let loose the final two shots in his magazine.  "You won't win!"   Bull rolled his eyes as he popped the spent magazine from his weapon and fished a new one from his jacket. He slid it in with a satisfying click and cocked the first round.  "Fuck you, Bear! I'm taking you out this time!" Bull retorted.  From somewhere behind him another shot rang out, deeper and more resonant. The sound of a rifle. Someone else was here.  Bull spun as he went down to one knee, searching the rafters of the warehouse for the hidden shooter.  "Did you see that? Bear? Did you see the shooter?"  There was no response.  Hesitantly, Bull peeked around the corner and saw Bear's body, a clean shot through the head. Bear's lifeless eyes stared unblinkingly.  Bull understood everything in a moment. He thought he'd been here to trap Bear, but the trap was set for both of them.  Hidden in the rafters, JPow took aim at his second target.  "Theta gang forever, motherfuckers."|2022-07-19 10:05:30

It went up to around $495 should‚Äôve sold and took my small profit but i got greedy, so i watched the stock fall a week ago. sold at around 75% loss had $89 premium after. Look at the stock yesterday and today, it‚Äôs worth $3.50 again and now like $3.90 so what happened in the end. I got shook out by market manipulators i mean market movers. Next time i shouldn‚Äôt paperhand if i believe a stock is gonna go in the direction i pick. So long story short, don‚Äôt sell unless you‚Äôre making profit, If you‚Äôre call or put is down like 70% or more just let expire worthless because who knows it could come back up just like that.|2022-07-19 12:38:46
