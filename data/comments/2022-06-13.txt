The problem is that everyone was way too optimistic about inflation peaking and falling; we're going to be at 7+% inflation the rest of this year.  There's just not going to be any silver lining here for the economy.  The only thing that would make me bullish quicker is if JPow brings out the hammer and jacks up rates 1.5-2% this week.

As soon as you start thinking "eh, my position is tanking right after I got into it but I want to save my last day trade", you've already lost. If you can sell and re-buy more contracts at a lower price, you will protect yourself from massive losses and get better returns.

c6ta35|vb8m7m|vb8m7m|3|what's the case for inflation getting under control?  As far as I can tell, we have supply chain disruptions from Covid, and in 3 months we will have supply chain disruptions from food shortages, and two months later we'll have an election that Republicans will win, meaning that Congress and the President will prevent each other from doing anything.  By that time, interest rates will be like 3% or something. Doesn't it make sense for everybody to be taking out loans right now to buy stuff that will appreciate 8% in value by next year? And if everybody does that, we just get more inflation.   I don't see how this stops.|2022-06-13 05:39:50

Didn't invest enough to kill me but it's enough to make me comfortable for life when it comes back. Adding lots more renewable shares. I'm good with piggybacking. Unfortunately I know alot of people who's retirement accounts are getting killed and they are now having to wait to retire. Can't stand the Jamie Dimon's of the world.

The downed bull gave a small cry as blood seeped from the deep wounds the bear had inflicted. The bear snorted and licked its lips then lunged for the bull's exposed throat.  A shot rang out, birds scattering into the crystal-blue sky. A bullet tore through the bear's right eye and exited through the side of his skull. With a thud, he slumped to the ground.  JPow shifted his aim, centering his shot for the bull's forehead, "Theta gang forever, you motherfuckers."|2022-06-13 11:50:36

But before then they will plunge another upward stream to throw people off, they don't want peope to know in an obvious way, when it's all going down, they want to have as many people unprepared and caught in it as possible when it actually crashes legit.

c7j76c|vb8m7m|vb8m7m|-7| No, no, no, no, no.   Wrong, wrong, wrong.  It's come to my attention that you're not measuring up.  You'll need to stay late again.  With no overtime.  Your project has to be completely redone.  You can't seem to do anything right.  Oh, I'm going to have to write you up again.   You're just not measuring up.  That's three more demerits this week.  Did you get the memo about the pay-cuts?  10 percent across the board.  We've got to cut back.  It's the bottom line you see.  And your insurance co-pays, they're going up.  Better tighten your belt.  We're merging with a bigger company.  There is going to be one flavor of ice cream, one brand of coffee, one car.  There are twenty people waiting for your job.  One thirds of Americans work for less than 8.50 per hour, get used to it.  Be happy with what you've got.  You'll have to play catch up on the weekend, with no overtime pay, of course.  You're not meeting your quota.  What's that you say?  The quotas impossible to meet?  Duh.  Here's how it works, I sit in my office, my corner office.  And I do some simple math, I look at other companies similar to ours.  I get stats, I take a nap, I crunch some numbers.  And if the figures show that it's only humanly possible to complete, say 10 projects per week?  I double it.  And that becomes your new quota.  Twenty projects per week.  Simple.  Of course it's impossible.  That's the whole point.  Gotta keep you on edge.  We'll give you some malarkey about setting the bar high, meeting goals, etc.  But that's not the real reason.  We gotta keep you in fear.  Fearful people develop low self esteem.  Thus, they'll never ask for a raise.  What, you want a raise?|2022-06-13 09:45:00
