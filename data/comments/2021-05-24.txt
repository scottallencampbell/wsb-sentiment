zb6ta3|njubrl|njubrl|7|i think SPCE can correct on a daily basis by 1$ or 2$ at any point of time but if we r talking about any sort of longer term it will only go up. reason is theres no bear thesis on this left. big firms with big short positions have absolutely no reason to short this anymore at this point, with proof of concept. and most institutions are not in this stock and might have to take it seriously, and even a few of them coming in could mean a drastic rise.    if you didnt read the above paragraph, short conclusion is SPCE will be 100$ this year.|2021-05-24 14:56:20

za2o7c|njubrl|njubrl|4|So I had a bunch of $SPCE calls:  $36c 5/28 - sold at open (+25%)  $33c 5/28 - sold at open (+50%)  $30c 5/28 - sold at open (+25%)  $22.5c 5/28 - sold at open (+1200%)  $26.5c 6/4 - holding to see what happens  I assume that theta and IV would fuck the 5/28 calls from here on out no matter what, especially the OTM calls. Not sure if I should have just also sold the 6/4 call and waited to see about buying back after a drop. Was this a decent strategy?|2021-05-24 10:04:10

zasih4|njubrl|njubrl|6|SPCE is boutta fuckin break out of the atmosphere. All FUD has been shaken off today by this solid volume and price action to go along with an awesome test flight. This is one space company both retail investors and big money can shove stacks into because it actually has what looks to be a functional, and, in the scope of private spacecraft, fairly ready first version of a product that mankind has been waiting decades for.  Don't forget, TLRY had 30% SI and had a fat gamma slamma. SPCE currently has a smaller market cap and similar SI position to go along with a killer newspiece and bullish rumors. TLRY practically only moved because the market was thirsty and there *could* of been a law going into place allowing banks to do dealings with cannabis.

zabe5f|njubrl|njubrl|1|According to the ticker on Google's page, the QQQ launched in spring of 1999 at about $53. It peaked in early 2000 at over $111, and by the fall of 2002 it was under $22.     If you're a long term investor, it doesn't matter very much at what point in that timeline you bought QQQ shares, because they'd be worth a fucking fortune today regardless.     If you're a permabear buying puts in 1999 or 2000, it looks at first glance like the shorting opportunity of a lifetime. But you would've run into both psychological and solvency issues trying to short for that length of time. You would have continued to lose lots of money at an alarming rate, right up until the March 2000 peak. Then unless you timed your exit perfectly in mid April 2000, you would've got fucked by the dead cat bounce in September of 2000, and probably ran out of money to buy puts about that time and forced to become a prostitute selling $20 blowjobs in the alley over by Wendy's. But if you somehow held on and continued buying QQQ puts, you would've made a bunch of money on them eventually. Perhaps enough to almost break even on all your losses incurred since 1999.     I'm not trying to make comparisons between then and now; I do think we're in a bubble, but it's not at all similar to the 2000 or 2008 ones and unlikely to play out in the same way. The takeaway is that speculative bubbles inflate over a long period of time, and when they do pop it can take months. You could be the next Burry, but more likely you will just get buried. So you basically have to wait until a downtrend is confirmed before buying puts. If you try to Nostradamus the market as if there will be a sudden rug pull during a time when the Fed is injecting $125 bil per month, you will have a bad time. And by you I mean me.|2021-05-24 11:10:44

z9jqsi|njubrl|njubrl|0|Ok I have to say something.  Some bears are complete utterly useless idiots.  You have a stock like Virgin Galatic $spce.   The had a successful test flight and may actually start launching regular people to space.    This is a very definition of a stock that you should not short.  Long term your talking about an airline that fly people to space which is pretty bullish long term if this plays out.  I see so many bears who still talk trash instead of cutting their losses. When you short a stock there is no limit to your losses.  You can lose more then you invested.  I see the same idiots also talking about Tesla and other Ev's.  Do you self a favor and understand what you are doing. Expect to see a lot loss porn from them over the summer.|2021-05-24 07:17:16

za4wfo|njubrl|njubrl|2|Jesus RBLX turned out to the real spaceship this morning, like I expected some sort of a dip after strong gains last week to buy some more of this stock but nope no dip just gains. A 6.50 jump this morning and damn close to 90 bucks a stock that may 10th was trading for 64 bucks and people were saying it was overvalued THEN.  People need to stop thinking of RBLX as just a game and can't understand why it's so big, RBLX is the current minecraft/youtube/steam of younger kids and if it doesn't screw this is up it will have them locked in for decades.   It's a platform that 'content' creators and streamers will use to get their stuff out to people who will in turn buy into roblox ingame currency to buy said content that those 'content' creators will cash out that currency but with fee's paid to the company to get paid in real money much like YouTube allowed people to monetize their videos but still got a cut.  Hell there is a video game studio "Uplift Games" now making Games just in Roblox after their breakout hit Adopt Me! became so popular that it's ingame numbers rivaled CS:GO and this is before Roblox moves onto even more kid friendly platforms like the Switch. I guess what I'm saying is I like this stock.|2021-05-24 10:21:04

Plus poor performance on automated driving, poor build quality, and higher prices relative to current competition.  I wouldn't expect to make much on it in 2021.

If we bounce off of 13,500 we’ll be back in the hunt for ATHs after Memorial Day.
