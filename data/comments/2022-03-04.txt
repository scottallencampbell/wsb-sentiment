zbc4ao|t6gi7y|t6gi7y|12|The funniest thing I like to do is put in a limit order on futures and watch the underlying straight away move opposite direction.. I have done it 5 times so far but because I have options as a hedge I'm not losing much money but it's giving me an insight into how manipulated this shit is.. Literally 80-90% of trades are algos throwing shit back and forth with each other - as soon as they see a retail order they pump/dump the underlying in opposite direction hoping for them to panic sell/buy.. Easy money - if retail left the market their profits would shrink and they would have to battle each other. We are the free money.|2022-03-04 07:37:04

zb6jnr|t6gi7y|t6gi7y|3|The best analogue for the current market period is probably mid-2015 to mid-2016.  We went through a 12-14 month consolidation at that point that featured 2 major selloff windows that recovered decently well; there was a lot of growth concerns that a new recession was potentially starting arriving  in late 2015/early 2016.  It feels possible that we don't touch SPY 480 again until the end of this year due to the growth concerns/inflation shocks (+ Russia detaching from global economy shock) that the market needs to process over much of this year.  Markets usually hit a final bottom 3-4 months before growth concerns/inflation shocks end (it's been like that in every period of recession/economic weakness).  I'd assume that will occur around mid-year.|2022-03-04 06:47:48

Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping after having risen, this is the most reliable indicator signaling significant moves in the stock market. Bond prices rising.   Inflation running hot.    The s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies.   Some of which are extremely overvalued.    China's market has been struggling for the last year.   Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value.   The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now)   Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic).   Supply lines are weak.    Russian economy has gone down the shitter.    OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.     AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.      Bull cases:  WW3 might not happen.  Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-03-04 05:02:09

zb41ao|t6gi7y|t6gi7y|1|Still feels like we need a final flush on growth concerns as a result of spiking inflation/Russia economic shock to clear out bullish sentiment and force VIX backwardation into an extremely steep posture.  We've had 4 weeks now of an increasing volatility; at some point soon we'd need to see a big spike upwards for a final sentiment flush.  VIX closed at a 13 month high yesterday, but it's been a slow grind upwards and not a panic-driven selloff.  Of course it's going to depend on what growth looks like and how long this inflationary shock will last; probably looking at 6 months of no/mediocre growth ending around August-September as markets adjust to these shocks.  SPY 400 feels likely in the coming months unless the Russia-Ukraine situation resolves quickly and things go back to how they were a few weeks ago (that seems impossible).|2022-03-04 06:23:16

zb7r12|t6gi7y|t6gi7y|1|So I'm gonna go analyze Jan 28/Feb 4(SPY) as those were the last two Friday PM with big Gap downs. Feb 3 we closed 446.60, opened Feb 4th 446.35 (AH created large mvmt up to 451 then gapped down) That morning was a Kang Gang morning and SPY went to 448 by 10am then to 444 by 11:10am, at 11:15 we had a huge movement from 444 to 452 until 3:10pm, finally selling off and closing at 448.7.  Jan 27th we closed at 431.24 and had AH mvmt up to 435 eventually gapping down PM the 28th only significant difference is PM mvmt filled the gap and we opened at 432.68, the price action that day dropped us to 427 by 10am then sporadic mvmt to 437 by 12:15pm at 2pm we had a drop back down to 431 with an EOD rally closing at 441..(I'm sure one of those days had a catalyst but to lazy to go look for what it was) but I'll make my moves based on indicators with those two days in a similar set-up Fuk a Tedtalk|2022-03-04 06:58:56

They don't realize the same ability to cut off and cripple Russia could be turned around and pointed at any one of our nations at a later date for any reason deemed publicly acceptable.  While I understand the desire to punish Russia for their very bloody incursion, we're dealing with a madman that isn't likely to relent to spare his citizenry.  He just doesn't care.  And his citizenry have no means to dispose of him; He's off in some bunker in the mountains.  Shaky precedent being formed.  We'd be in a world of hurt say 15-25 years from now should China supplant the US as the dominant global power and (at least co-)reserve currency, united with Russia and other fearfully aligned export-rich nations, should they desire revenge.|2022-03-04 07:09:06
