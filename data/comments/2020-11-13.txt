c62c5h|jtf81v|jtf81v|14|boys here is my rant for the day.   the market does what a majority of people dont expect to happen. i hear a bunch of you clowns on here saying sPy pUts because of the increasing covid cases. Listen ladies and gentlemen every dickbrain on here and on wall street understands the severity of the situation.  As explained last night in my rant, the bond market is the market to be on the lookout for, more specifically the corporate bond market, which at the time of writing this looks to be doing A ok. All of you doomers trying to time this crash are trying to do something, which is very difficult and your rationale of covid numbers increasing is so infantile it is almost laughable.   Now if you boys and girls can tell me something like I see the spread of s and p to 30 year bonds decreasing or I see the corporate bond market begin to have a liquidity crunch I will start to hear you out. Sometimes you have to look at bigger macroeconomic themes if you really want to reap the rewards of this game.   This game is not so simple and yes I understand that this is a wendy's, but for fucks sake at least if you go to a wendy's you should know not to order shrimp tacos.|2020-11-13 11:07:50

c5c375|jtf81v|jtf81v|4|Nio:  >You know they say all car companies are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Ford Motor Company and you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another EV company you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a Chinese automotive freak, and I'm not normal! So you got a 25 percent at best at beat me. And then you add Li Auto to the mix? You-the chances of winning drastically go down. See, the 3-Way at Market Open, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning. But I! I got a 66 and two thirds chance of winning, cuz Li Auto KNOOOWS it can't beat me, and it's not even gonna try. So, Ford, you take your thirty three and a third chance minus my twenty five percent chance (if we was to go one on one) and you got an eight and a third chance of winning at Market Open. But then you take my 75 percent chance of winnin' (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 and two thirds…percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning at Market Open! Ford? The numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Market Open!"|2020-11-13 06:41:35

Bob's your uncle  The call prices are tanking, puts are up, does this mean any potential downside from earnings will be hard to gain value with a put, come Tuesday? I have a feeling with this pullback, people are gonna be more hesitant since it can swing pretty wildly and isn't a total "stonks only go up," so the retail investors probably aren't going to make this surge as fast as it just did but I think short puts until earnings then long calls might be the way to go.|2020-11-13 13:34:14

Citron's reports are usually damning in tone, armed with a provocative headline and followed up with a targeted social-media push, what they seem to do quite well is they are able to spin existing facts into a horrible scenario that reads very badly in order to create market panic.  While information Citron Research publishes are carefully selected and distributed in ways that do not break the law at first sight, the SEC and FINRA have overlooked the fact that Left and Citron gains are a result of distributing catalysts in an anticipation of substantial price changes due to public response in either panic, encouragement, or simply a catalyst action wave ride. Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic shortly after taking a trading position so they and their clients can make the most amount of financial gains on the expense of regular investors.|2020-11-13 12:51:11

The collective EV hype drove price way up and the Citron article made people panic sell but majority of shareholders are still institutions. Support will reflect that going into ER. If they beat earnings it may cause another FOMO run before NIO day but long term it shouldn't be less than $40.

Computers can do that for you if you'd just master the art of trailing stop losses. Everyone spends time buying, but far few try to master the art of getting good at exiting and setting conditional brackets.  Nio would have been the perfect stock to set a conditional order on while it was running so that you could have found the top and sold before the tremendous drop.|2020-11-13 13:35:11

Then it started its recovery to $43 and closed at $49 yesterday. ATH today above $54 and a strong pull back then bounce off of ~$45.

c5b83i|jtf81v|jtf81v|5|Today’s moves:   Feeling bearish, but MRNA vax news could make markets shake up, less so than the PFE announce (first dances are always the best).   Shorts: SOLO (clown cars), DNKG (lockdowns and temp profit hype may make it overbought, I’m bullish long on DKNG, but near term C19 is gonna kneecap it), SPY 0dte if it hits peaks after open, there’s no catalyst for people to be optimistic over the weekend and Mango is still a wildcard, and doubt a concession.   Calls: HD (earnings will blow the doors off), TGT (should have an earnings run, have to do more DD), MRNA (maybe, it’s looking pretty priced in but who knows in this market), maybe CHGG as it’s oversold and education through Feb-March will likely be remote learning. ZM also for same reason. Specific tech after review of recent charts, if anything is lagging rebound. There will be new restrictions going into Jan-Feb.  I’m staying away from: BABA (Winnie the Pooh himself has it out for them), NIO (too close to roulette for me today), APPL (not sure what their problem is right now), Cruiselines (old person death ships), and your mom.|2020-11-13 06:29:29

Okay no cause for concern. Microsoft has also had significant outflows all month including insiders and also hedge funds, it accounts for another 1/30th of the entire stock market. If you don’t think nows a time to be cautious Idk what to fucking tell you people. You can spend less than 500 to buy 100 shares of spxs sell OTM call and if the market does drop you can recuperate. It’s triple leveraged to the downside it can really reduce your risk to the market in case it does correct.|2020-11-13 10:29:56

All EVs need them.    Toyota, GM, BMW, Nissan, etc. are going to eat all of these little minnow EV companies alive because they have the best engineers in the world.  People buy dog shit like Nio, XPEV, and Li while completely overlooking a company like TM's coming tech and their fortress of a balance sheet.  Toyota is going to blow away a lot of the competition with their solid state battery tech.    Gee, what is an average consumer going to buy?  A car from TM who they're already familiar with and who has a great reputation that's selling a car with solid state battery tech that can charge the car to 100% in 10-15 minutes, or a car from some little dinky clown ass firm no one has ever heard of that struggles with quality control and customer support and who has a car that takes 10-15 minutes just to get a 10% charge?

Few weeks ago I read that Toyota still believes in their Hydrogen tech and won't make an EV until 2025. Eerily similar to the things Blockbuster used to say bf going bankrupt.   Today Netflix has multiple competitors and streaming is the norm. Imagine what the EV market will look like in 5-10 yrs?   TL:DR buy EV calls 👍💰|2020-11-13 09:09:31

c6nqyr|jtf81v|jtf81v|4|Let me tell you the story of NIO. A stock once loved by all was corroded by a tiny dick analyst who just loves to see stocks fall. While everyone laughed at those who impulsively and with greed bought FDs and calls at the top, it was those who stayed silent with their shares and leaps that truly reaped the day. By the middle of 2021, NIO had reached 100, a level no one thought was attainable so quickly. Boys, its time to gather your eggs, put them into nio leaps/shares, hold on tight, and get ready for a stock that will one day make your wallet fat and leave your wife’s boyfriend packing his bags.|2020-11-13 14:02:29

c6fod0|jtf81v|jtf81v|2|For everyone asking why ZM is going down. The market is forward thinking and zoom is CRAZY overvalued compared to other tech stocks. YES everyone knows a second wave is coming. But the market is forward thinking, and a vaccine in the very near future is all but certain now.  Once that happens, will zoom still be in a better position than before corona?

It will cut to a 40b market share. It will fall to 35 to do that. Good luck call holders. Thank god for my puts. Gonna retire on Tuesday.  All I know is. I’ve done my part. I’ve posted 20 times.

How do you not see there’s an ev bubble. “China is switching to all electric” “they’re the cars of the future” is some of the stupid shit I’ve been hearing meanwhile the largest car companies in the world, that make and sell a tens/hundreds of times more cars (of the present) aren’t worth as much. And most people will just buy an established car makers ev because all it takes is the big car manufacturers to flip a switch and now they’re making evs. You guys are acting like what propels the car makes a difference and when this bubble pops you guys are going to say wow what makes a car go zoom zoom doesn’t actually make a difference in a company’s valuation|2020-11-13 11:22:42

How do you not see there’s an ev bubble. “China is switching to all electric” “they’re the cars of the future” is some of the stupid shit I’ve been hearing meanwhile the largest car companies in the world, that make and sell a tens/hundreds of times more cars (of the present) aren’t worth as much. And most people will just buy an established car makers ev because all it takes is the big car manufacturers to flip a switch and now they’re making evs. You guys are acting like what propels the car makes a difference and when this bubble pops you guys are going to say wow what makes a car go zoom zoom doesn’t actually make a difference in a company’s valuation|2020-11-13 11:25:21
