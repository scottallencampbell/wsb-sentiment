wrmwsr|n3sdrh|n3sdrh|34|Futures are pointing higher, with small caps leading the way. Russell 2000 is up 0.9% S&P 500 and Dow Industrials up about 0.5%. Nasdaq up about 0.2%. That‚Äôs as of 0630.  Today we have a couple of PMI reports, starting with manufacturing at 0945 and ISM manufacturing out at 1000. The Chicago PMI on Friday posted its strongest reading since 1983 (not a typo). Factory gate prices rose to their highest level since 1980. There appears to be a clear manufacturing boom happening in this country. And also inflation, which the Fed calls transitory.  Speaking of the Fed, we get a speech from Chairman Powell at 1430. Not expecting him to say much if he didn‚Äôt deviate from his commentary last week.  Also a ton of earnings. Lowe‚Äôs just came out with a beat on EPS. Reopening trade companies Wynn Resorts and Avis are out later.  Amid all the Sturm und Drang (German expression) April was a strong month for risk assets. Inflation is certainly here but if the Fed doesn‚Äôt care (yet) then it stands to reason that things should continue to go higher.|2021-05-03 05:43:29

They're further refunding me a few hundred bucks, because according to them "we have record of when you tried to close the position, so your refund is the difference between the stock proce at that time and the price now".

wtgj23|n3sdrh|n3sdrh|4|How the fuck do TSLA, COIN, SQ maintain retard P/E ratios?   Any even more mind boggling, how do investors rationalize major growth *on top of the already retarded valuation*??  Keep in mind I was saying this hearsay when TSLA was going nuclear and was told that I‚Äôm an idiot and the market doesn‚Äôt care about fundamentals. Well if you bought TSLA this calender year you‚Äôve lost a lot of money (in a year where indexes are up). Also it‚Äôs strange how just about every sector is made up with stocks with similar P/E ratios, and ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks have high P/E ratios while safe dividend stocks have much lower P/E ratios. It‚Äôs almost like it matters or something.|2021-05-03 14:16:19

And now that the speculative rally is slowing down and money is being taken away from speculative stocks, ARK is going back to its real worth and is facing a huge correction. Cathie was a genius only becuase of circumstance, the market got crazy and loved speculative risky stocks, and her funds that consisted mostly of speculative stocks just happened to be what the market loved & so that made har funds explode. Now that money is being taken away from speculative stocks and we're going back to normal, she will be seen for what she is, someone who was lucky enough that the greatest stock market bull-run just happened to love her type of stocks. That's it. Not a genius, circumstantial luck.|2021-05-03 14:45:45

I've watched a ton of videos and read about them, and they look like a pretty easy relatively low risk thing... that worries me, beause that's usually when something I don't know about would bite me on the ass. If I don't mind buy and hold 100 shares of various stocks and am willing to take the risk that they may in general decline in value, can't I pretty much just keep writing covered calls on them forever, or until they go In The Money and I gotta sell 'em for a profit? What am I missing? I'd be perfectly happing making 2 percent profit per month. It's not go buy a boat money, but it would  pay an entire utility bill worth of profit.|2021-05-03 10:41:54

wttbfw|n3sdrh|n3sdrh|1|I think I just made a financially retarded decision but I'm not sure. Near close I bought 100 shares of NOK. I also put in orders to sell the $4.5c exp 5/7 and to buy a $5p exp 5/7. Assuming both my contracts fill, I get a $41 credit for the covered call and pay $20 debit for the put:  (1) If price stays flat, I make a $21 spread between my collected call premium and debited put.  (2) If price takes a dump, I collect the CC premium and my put becomes more valuable, hedging the loss on shares.  (3) If price raises, I keep my CC premium and get assigned at a very modest profit on shares. I close the put contract for a loss, but recoup some of the $20 I spent on it.  Where does it go tits up at? I assume my problem is going to be that one or both of my contracts don't get filled.|2021-05-03 15:49:17
