This is to let you know that if you post **anything** political that doesn't relate **directly** to markets in this thread (or elsewhere on WSB) the comments and/or posts will be removed and you may receive a ban. Keep WSB clean of your r/politics bullshit.  To the good, smooth-brained autists amongst you - if you see these, report them. I have a gap in my schedule for the next 60 minutes and I promise I will deal with them personally. Roast them in the comments (within reason).

Either directly or indirectly.   - Dan Loeb explicitly brought it up in recent letter. Basically says the Fed is bailing out bad companies and screwing over good ones.  - Warren/Munger are sitting out the market.  - Ray Dalio thinks there are going to be bad long term consequences of this. Specifically uncontrolled inflation, and bigger wealth inequality. - David Tepper is confused by the rally - Jim Cramer looks like he’s been drinking more|2020-04-23 06:52:51

Price taps stop loss then goes on to double without you. Look at $800 left in account. Try DPZ, DOUBLES! Hold to this morning, bottom falls out. Look at daytrade indicators, full.

So market goes up if it does well, but if it fails we are still way up? No adjustments there... ok...  They literally just want this market to pump, everyone does. No logic.  Now they have Feuerstein on to pump it again.  Also it’s not a vaccine CNBC! Stop saying that in the same sentence with it. It’s a treatment.  I hope we do find one btw.

By opening green and rising to a significant level for stocks, it finally kills the bears' hope of a reversal and leads to selling. At the same time, bulls are buying calls or stocks bc of hope of the stocks rising. Then when no bears are left and a lot of bulls are in, the market finally reverses. This leads bears and bulls to get fucking destroyed. We are one-in-same, little guys trying to make money. But are always fucked by the big boyz.|2020-04-23 09:15:35

oapguf|g6k3gr|g6k3gr|6|9:45 a.m. ET: U.S. economic output contracts at record pace in April: IHS Markit  IHS Markit’s flash April U.S. composite output index slumped to 27.4 from 40.9 in March, hitting the lowest level in survey history and representing the fastest drawdown in private-sector output since the series began in late 2009, according to the report.  The drop was led by a slide in the U.S. services purchasing managers index (PMI), which dropped to a record low of 27.0 in April from 39.8 in March, according to the preliminary monthly survey. Consensus economists expected the services PMI to decline to 30.0, according to Bloomberg data.  The manufacturing PMI declined to a more than 11-year low of 36.9 from 48.5 in March. Readings below the neutral level of 50 indicate contraction.|2020-04-23 09:00:29

I know the recovery is going to be long and difficult but looking at the leaps the break evens are more than obtainable. Premiums are still fairly low. The stocks are all sitting at or near the bottom that we saw in the market early March rather than rallying with the rest of the market. The government will not then fail and will offer stimulus as required for the larger carriers (AAL / Delta) so bankruptcy is really that much of a concern (though a non zero chance for sure).|2020-04-23 08:30:09

FOMO into DPZ earnings, lose everything 2. Sell Zoom call before the selloff (up 100% since then) 3. Hold BA call instead of the Zoom call (down 70% since then) 4. Buy a 4/24 OTM TSLA call in hopes of a retard strength bounce post-dump (down 70% since then)  Doing another dumb thing and just gonna hold BA and TSLA calls at this point since losing another couple hundred bucks will hurt less than if either moons tomorrow|2020-04-23 14:48:57

obnn6s|g6k3gr|g6k3gr|10|As a long term bear (no such thing as a permabear), that action just now is about all I need to capitulate. It’s not about how much I’ve lost or whether I think there are fundamental reasons for a downturn. It’s about how the market just reacted.   If we truly are in a high volatility bear market, an algo drop like that would lead to immediate panic selling and a mini-crash. Instead the dip was IMMEDIATELY bought up. People simply do not believe in selling right now, even when things look scary. Impossible to see how we suddenly go down from here based on that action.|2020-04-23 12:08:07

obpsku|g6k3gr|g6k3gr|8|Just read the leaked Gilead report, that drug doesn't work based on that study.....  " According to the summary of the China study, remdesivir was “not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement” compared to a standard of care control. After one month, it appeared 13.9% of the remdesivir patients had died compared to 12.8% of patients in the control arm. The difference was not statistically significant "     that is a solidly negative study, 400+ RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED study     Gilead is trying to spin this, but they know they gotta drop their own report soon        [https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/23/data-on-gileads-remdesivir-released-by-accident-show-no-benefit-for-coronavirus-patients/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/23/data-on-gileads-remdesivir-released-by-accident-show-no-benefit-for-coronavirus-patients/)|2020-04-23 12:19:02

Beginning next year, Apple will start the transition away from Intel chips used in its Macs to its own custom-designed ARM-based CPUs based on the A-series chipset found in its iPhones and iPads.  So long x86 in the Mac world.  Probably not a big part of intel's business, but may spook investors psychologically. Wonder if we're going to hit sub $50 on intel due to loss of confidence and fears of ARM taking over the PC or server market eventually. Worse Intel's 5G chip seems dead-ish too.|2020-04-23 09:01:17

"This is due in part to employers retaining their employees and workers finding other jobs."  Don't you all see things are looking up!?!?

He made $60,000 in a few minutes and then asked to transfer more of my money from my bank account to trade with.  I was hesitant but he said he can see the future and I have nothing to worry about.  I said OK.  Next thing I know he had overdrawn my bank account by $2 Million.  I started to panic but then I looked at the trades he was doing and I was up $14 Million.  I was so damn happy. I started dancing.  I figured after I pay off the $2 Million overdraft I get to keep $12 Million.  Then he lost all the money in the trading account, doing trades a lightning speed going in and out of losing position after losing position.  Finally account was a $0 and bank was overdrawn by -$2 Million.  He laughed at me and disappeared.  ..what is my subconscious trying to tell me?|2020-04-23 10:36:06

In other words, it's only the sentiment that is good.  The idea that Powell/Trump have the power to save this economy if they print enough money is false. The damage in dollars far exceeds the QE in dollars. But so long as the perception exists that the powerful people WON'T LET IT DROP, stocks continue to rise.

Calls on CEQP absolutely PRINTED (+14% stock movement)  Puts on SNAP PRINTED (-12% stock movement)  Puts on CAKE PRINTED (-8% stock movement)  Calls on SAVE ended flat, which is ok with me.  You don't get these huge swings on SPY. SPY ain't usually gonna jump up 20% in one day, but it happens all the time to random stocks in this market. And when you play individual stocks, you can pick specific industries/companies and not be a slave to the overall market swings, so both puts and calls can print on any given day.  This whole "pick team bear or team bull and play SPY" thing is dumb rn. The huge swings are over for the moment.

What I'm unsure of, is what range and what cost option makes the most sense. So, let's say for example I think PLAY (Dave and Buster's) is going to go down in the near-ish future. If the price is currently at $12 and I think by July it will be $9, what is the best option for me to take? Knowing that the price is already at $12, is there any value to buying let's say, a $15 put? Any help appreciated!|2020-04-23 07:41:52

Can theta even significantly fuck you in a few hours? Or are market prices for the options themselves shifting?  Just curious for opinions, please feel free to rip into me.
