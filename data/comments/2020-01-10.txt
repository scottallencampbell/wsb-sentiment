Futures on S&P        500 were up 4.25 points while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures        gained 14 points.*   >   >*The increase of 145,000 nonfarm payrolls fell short of the 160,000 that        economists polled by Bloomberg expected. The result is        significantly lower than the Nov. 2019 increase, which        was revised slightly lower to 256,000, and it's below the average        monthly gain of 174,000 during 2019.*   >   >*The unemployment rate held at a half-century low of 3.5%, matching        economists' projections.*   >   >*As hiring cooled, so did increases in workers' pay. Average hourly        earnings rose 0.4% in December from November, slower than the 0.3% gain        (which was revised from 0.2%) a month earlier. The increase was below        economists' expectations for 0.3% wage growth. On a year-over-year        basis, workers' hourly pay rose just 2.9%, the lowest since Sept.        2018 and below an expected 3.1% rate of increase.*|2020-01-10 07:49:56

dqo270|emphz2|emphz2|3|>  S&P Volatility Is About as Low as It Ever Gets   >   >By Andrew Cinko   >   >(Bloomberg) -- **The S&P 500's historical volatility is scrapping the bottom of its 50-year history, which** **suggests the mostly-placid grind higher in stocks is ticking closer to a bout of whipsawing prices.** And the catalyst for it could be earnings season.   At the current reading of 6.85, the S&P 500's 60-day historical vol is at a level that's rarely been seen over the last 50 years. Clearly, the Iran crisis did little to move the needle. With vol below 7, history suggests there's a step change in the odds of a sizeable pop occurring soon compared with periods when volatility is higher. **Of course, predicting the timing of these things remains a mug's game.**|2020-01-10 09:46:17

drerc6|emphz2|emphz2|3|It‚Äôs like ever since the invention of quantitative easing the market reacts so much differently now. It‚Äôs not necessarily the percentage gains but how we get to those percentage gains. The late 90s we had much better percentage gains with no QE. The thing now is they run it up consistently to red hot RSI‚Äòs and then dump it in a 4 or 5 day period. And then do it over again. In the past, pre-QE you would see more of a flat wave pattern up and down within weeks to months. Giving bulls and bears the opportunity to long and short the market ‚Äúkinda‚Äù equally. (always with an upward tilt) but since QE started, or honestly even algorithmic trading when it became really popular in the late 2000‚Äôs. It‚Äôs just different now, the charts look like cliffs instead of hills now. If you understand what I‚Äôm talking about. So we‚Äôre going to have another incident like Jan 2018 at some point. And then do it all over again. But it was never like this pre-2008.|2020-01-10 13:12:28

They can't imagine not being in SPY even a little bit to hedge because of all the money they'd be missing out on. It's like they don't remember losing half to 3/4 of their portfolios 10 years ago. They literally say this time is different and that can't happen again.   I hope for their sake we have one of the worst market crashes in history.
