The Fed also said in the statement that the ‚Äúfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.‚Äù The Fed acted hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would ‚Äúuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.‚Äù That echoed a statement Powell made on Friday.   \- Craig Torres - u/DifferentKindaHigh|2020-03-03 09:05:44

jcvvcb|fct06c|fct06c|22|Guys, the markets have me unable to sleep these days. I could not fall asleep last night until after 3 in the morning. I promptly woke up around 6:30 and made the mistake of looking at my phone and seeing premarket, and was obviously unable to fall back asleep.   Shit is consuming man.   I am definitely going to have to take a week long break in a couple months. Sleep for a couple days, go on a binger for a couple more, and sleep the remaining days after that. Then I should be reset and ready to go again.   On the plus side, in years past I would habitually waste my days away (I have a night job) and sleep in until the afternoon, but with activity in the markets the last year or two, I have become much more regular and once again developed a more diurnal schedule.   Anyways, good luck today everyone. Market seems to be up again so we shall see what the day brings.|2020-03-03 06:28:40

Now you‚Äôre onto the 3rd of the Elite 4 and still haven‚Äôt faced the champion and your charizard is down to 60% health and you use your last full heal?    That‚Äôs what a fucking rate cut will be after cutting rates 3x last year. Hopefully you retards can understand a bit easier now.

jdas1x|fct06c|fct06c|17|For those of you wondering "WHY THE FUCK ISN'T THE MARKET MOONING???". Let me break this down.  Cutting interest rate is supposed to stimulate demand. When it's cheap to borrow money, companies and consumers increase their spending.   Consumers go out and buy 0% car loans, and buy their 5th 70" TV on a "lower" interest credit card. This increase spending prompts the companies to buy more equipment, and their decision is made even easier because of the lower interest rate, and thus the companies produce more cars and TVs for the American consumers.  That's grossly generalized consumption cycle. Now what the fuck does this virus do? It's going to make people scared of living their life. Already some areas on the west coast people are starting to stay the fuck at home. They don't give a fuck if there's low interest rate credit cards if they are getting afraid of getting aids when they leave the house.|2020-03-03 09:30:49

jdhy8z|fct06c|fct06c|12|Here's the problem with the rate cut:  We were already below where rates should be.  If rates were to be economically neutral, they should have been over 2% going into today, but they weren't...  We were already in an economically supportive rate posture.  If it isn't already clear, the Fed is just supporting asset prices at this point.  A 0.50 cut would have made sense if they hadn't already given 3 0.25 cuts last year.  The economy was already as juiced as it needed to be heading into this virus disruption.  So yeah, nobody believes this rate cut is temporary in any sense of the word because there's no way the market will price in rate hikes at any point in the next year.  This may end up working out and the S&P/Dow/Nasdaq hit ATHs in the next few months, but for the long-term, this is just another reckless decision.  We're going to have few tools to fight the next recession other than QE/outright asset purchases.|2020-03-03 10:30:56

jd9z1f|fct06c|fct06c|31|Everyone here seems to think that the Fed cuts rates solely for the benefit of valuations of companies in the stock market.  **That's fucking retarded.**  But completely in character for this sub.  Lowering rates lowers the cost of borrowing money, across all segments of the economy, from corporate debt to small business debt, from student loans to home mortgages.  Why lower rates now?  In times of economic crisis, large, small, and start-up businesses all alike will borrow money in order to stay afloat.  By reducing rates, you make it easier for those companies to "keep their head above water".  This isn't being done to support asset prices.  It's being done to support businesses.  The market is fucking crashing, because this rate cut is an acknowledgement by the Central Bank that *things are going to be fucked* (economically speaking).  It really is just a flu with a higher fatality rate.  It isn't going to end the world.  BUT it is going to stick a dagger in the back of the world economy.  We have a global supply chain that looks like a truly massive spider web, that you just whacked with a broom.  When basic components become impossible to source, well.  Manufacturing can be sporadically ground to halt.  Even relatively small amounts of downtime can have dramatic affects on quarterly results.|2020-03-03 09:22:42

I wanted to give some perspective to all you retards that are covering your ears and going "nanananana can't hear you" when we keep trying to tell you what kind of a shit we are in.  Exhibit 1:  [https://imgur.com/a/zoipuC4](https://imgur.com/a/zoipuC4)  You know what saved our asses thus far? China effectively quarantining 200 million people and notice how their graph tapered off. Before it was on a parabolic growth trajectory.  Now let's zoom in on wtf is going on with that "Other countries" graph at the bottom.  Exhibit 2:  [https://imgur.com/a/fvYUa1S](https://imgur.com/a/fvYUa1S)  Oh shit. What the fuck do we know. It's going parabolic. I've been paying very close attention to this graph the last couple of weeks hoping it would show some sign of tapering off. Nope. Unless the rest of the world does something as insane as what China did, we are not curbing this parabolic growth.  So again. All you retards that don't think we are going any lower, that thinks central banks want stocks to go higher, that knows "STONKS ONLY GO UP", buckle up because your calls are about to become even more worthless than they already are.|2020-03-03 14:54:26

JP knows that the rate will have no effect on a correction like this and goes live this morning saying they are still watching, no need to step in. Trump throws a hissy fit and JPOW reacts by showing him how dumb of an idea that is.  Now bond yields continue to circle the drain, and equities can no longer finance their corporate debt as effectively. This simultaneously blows up the balance sheet for anyone in corporate M&A (Like JPOW was 15 years ago). Stocks drag down due to the growth implications of diminishing bond yields.  He should leave the monetary policy to the successful businessmen.|2020-03-03 12:58:27

jdpw8c|fct06c|fct06c|12|2020 was a good year.üíÄüëª  Good year to get burned. I'm done trading for a while.  Started the week with 27k. Started the year at around 2k went up to 34k by mid February. Got hosed yesterday at the pump then got hosed again today. 34k to 5.8k. Got another 25k margin call to top it off. So no fun stuff for 90 days.  I took 5200 out to pay bills. I bought a single SPY 1/15/21 240p with the last bit for the inevitable crash that is going to happen from all this retarded market pumping.  Good luck, everyone.

After a few moments you hear the engine shut off and the music come to a silence, you wait in anticipation for the face to emerge from the futuristic vehicle when all of sudden the door opens and you see me, dressed in this outfit. We make brief eye contact but because of my cyberpunk shades you‚Äôre not sure if I‚Äôm looking at you or in your direction. My face remains static and emotionless as I nod to you in acknowledgement.

"The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury currently stands at about 3.33%, down from nearly 4% about a month ago. The rate on this long-term government note is a key factor behind what happens to fixed-rate mortgages.  If rates continue to fall, they could hit not only a new low for the year - the 10-year briefly touched 3.28% in January - but could come close to falling below the 3.07% level they hit in June 2003, which was a 45-year low at the time."|2020-03-03 13:03:08

jdz2m7|fct06c|fct06c|2|Question:  On 2/27, I bought 3 contracts SPY $305p 2/28. Before the end of day, I sold 3 contract SPY $297p. I made around 2.4k off this trade. At that time I had around 4k in buying power. At the end of day I receive an email that says that my account is now restricted from purchasing. Now I can only sell stocks and close positions. Also my purchasing power went up to 95k~. Looking at my investment history, I see that my SPY sell was voided. Has anyone experienced something similar? I already emailed RH but havent heard back. What can I do to fix this?  Screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/42BE528|2020-03-03 13:00:18

Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.  Cuomo told Long Island radio station 103.9 that the unidentified man from Westchester County commuted to work in Manhattan and lives in a home with school-age children.  Cuomo said the man apparently had an underlying respiratory illness and no known travel history to China or other countries on the virus watch list.  The governor said more cases are expected as the outbreak spreads and testing ramps up.  "You're going to see an increasing spread," Cuomo said.¬†  \- *Associated Press*|2020-03-03 08:29:11

jd85ji|fct06c|fct06c|1|Fed Cuts Rates Half Point in Emergency Move Amid Spreading Virus 2020-03-03 15:00:10.666 GMT   By Craig Torres (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency half-percentage point interest rate cut Tuesday in a bid to protect the longest-ever economic expansion from the spreading coronavirus. ‚ÄúThe coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,‚Äù the Fed said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point.‚Äù The central bank also said it is ‚Äúclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.‚Äù The vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1% to 1.25% was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the ‚Äúfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.‚Äù The Fed acted hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would ‚Äúuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.‚Äù That echoed a statement Powell made on Friday.|2020-03-03 09:04:02

jd8chj|fct06c|fct06c|1|Well, market makers at investment banks have to get orders off in a range, a lot of orders are executed overnight and banks work to form an overnight range. If you have an order on the sales and trading desk at an investment bank, and you take a trade for your client, you quote him an average price you'll get him. If it breaks the overnight range and market makers thing, oh maybe we will have another 5% day tomorrow, and they still have 10,000 contracts left, then they'll just flood the market to get the contracts off. If they wait 1 hour hoping for the market to come back, they may have to sell 3% higher and then they'd probably lose that client and his commission. But im sure everyone will say "MaNiPuLaTiOn"  edit, the catalyst that scared market makers was probably the fed lowering 0.5% today|2020-03-03 09:06:02

Of course I'll selectively choose a time period that provides confirmation bias - we saw three peaks yesterday and the first shoulder, and now this upwards trend forms the head?  I  think it could go up a bit more from here yet.  I see it coming back down because the fed just cut rates aggressively when markets are only down 10% from ATH, and there hasn't even been any major disruption to day-to-day life in the US.  They must be expecting for things to get worse - if they're assuming stonks are going to keep going up from here they wouldn't have bothered.  Any thoughts?|2020-03-03 09:07:35

jd921f|fct06c|fct06c|1|Speculation as a SWE, but I'm guessing this is a database problem. In modern application architecture, almost everything can be scaled horizontally to alleviate this kind of failure due to a rush on the banks.   However, while there are good options for distributed/sharded databases, lots of companies still run on a simple M/s database setup, where there's a single primary server that replicates to one or more secondary servers on standby. Although databases are capable of scaling to pretty extreme levels, this means that when you hit your upper limit, there's no way to scale beyond adding more power.|2020-03-03 09:13:24

But I wouldn't fight the Fed here.  Powell will print us back to new ATHs if he has to...  Even if the economy doesn't need the cut, the stock market priced it in and so Powell gave it.  This is sort of a "sell the news" day, but I think the bottom was in last week unless coronavirus explodes out of control.  The reality is with all this stimulus having nowhere to go, stock prices should have a blowoff top at some point...|2020-03-03 11:24:16

In support of this, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is still detectable in some patients during the convalescent period. Therefore, given the probable neuroinvasion the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be currently underestimated." https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmv.25728|2020-03-03 05:49:56

Or since SPXL is more expensive ($50/share) is it the total money that is the hedge? So I buy 100 shares of SPXL @ $50 = $5000? TL:DR Do you hedge against share amounts or equity amounts?
