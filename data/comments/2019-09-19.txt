0rxspw|d6cfvs|d6cfvs|8|The last time the Fed started lowering interest rates was in September 2007. Soon after, the US went into a recession and the market went into a bear market.   The Fed stopped lowering rates in December 2008, which basically marked the bottom of the market and we headed higher ever since.   The Fed has either been not touching rates or raising rates this whole time.... until now.   The Fed has now begun to lower interest rates, for the second time this year.   Last time in 2007, Bernanke went in front of congress and said "growth is slowing, but no chance of recession".   Same thing Powell is saying now. Literally, the exact same thing at the exact same time.   I'm not saying we are headed lower. I really have no clue.   But history tends to repeat itself.   Again, I'm not saying anything will or won't happen.... just an interesting observation to say the least.|2019-09-19 07:11:36
