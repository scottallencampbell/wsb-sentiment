qfvsyh|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|45|GME is going down in history.  A struggling retailer in the same league as blockbuster becomes a meme and the retail community decides they like the stock.  Institutions caught with their dick in a Vice for selling more shares than the company has to offer, effectively promising to buying the entire company a couple times over at some arbitrary point in the future.  They expected to buy back at 0, but that vice got real tight real quick. Now a large and growing group of self proclaimed apes 🦍 are basically holding to the gears to that Vice demanding $1000+ for their shares knowing they’re going to get it as long as they stand together and diamond hand the shit out of their shares.  All it takes is one gamma squeeze and some delta neutral MM behavior to get this show on the road.

qfq64n|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|15|It’s all about the CPI report today. The consensus forecast is for 1.4% seasonally-adjusted (that’s YoY) Core CPI for February. That’s the most important one. There are month-over-month readings as well that will generate some noise, but the YoY gauge is the one to watch.  If it exceeds the target then there will be talk of inflation (and possibly hyperinflation. People like to bring that into the conversation) and more importantly speculation about the Fed needing to normalize rates. This could also prompt another bond sell-off. Stocks could follow, or not. Stocks have been very unpredictable lately, so quite hard to game this.  If the CPI falls short of the target, then that may not be all systems go either. Because this will mean the Fed has to keep rates lower for longer, which means inflation will invariably get worse. Or so the narrative goes. Of course this too could mean hyperinflation is incoming.  Obviously ignore all talk of hyperinflation. Hopefully you know better than that. The key is that the only thing that will ultimately end this bull market is higher rates. So the only thing to really be concerned about is a reading that exceeds the consensus forecast.|2021-03-10 05:52:33

With 'hedgies' going silent the last days and no trading restrictions, I don't see why this thing can't just simply explode. I smell some funds on this side now, they're greedy and they will squeeze this thing until it can't give more profit. I missed the train this time, but I wish you apes the best of luck.

These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards.

qg01xo|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|8|Hoping someone here will answer this even though it's a dumb question.   I know GME is going to tank again eventually. I hold shares, my plan is to sell as close to the top as possible (I have a trailing stop in place) and buy puts on the way back down with the profits.  But I still don't quite have a handle on how implied volatility affects options premiums, and the IV on GME is super high (of course). So the question is, if I buy puts on the way back down, will the IV fuck me? Or would I not have to worry about IV as much during the crash?   I'd ask this in the GME echo chamber but there are generally more reasonable people in the daily thread.  EDIT: Thanks for all the answers, I'm glad this didn't get buried.|2021-03-10 07:42:39

From another article, [I shit you not](https://imgur.com/a/RDzWKUS), FAANG is listed as 'Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet'  Tinfoil hat on but I think some hedge fund isn't quite done buying the AAPL dip|2021-03-10 09:44:24

Try going shopping for  new home these days where shitbox starter homes for young families now cost $600k and still need $150k renovations.  Rents are now $2000 per mo.

qh8jht|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|9|Halts are done to reduce volatility. These are circuit breakers that happen when a stock has a massive swing within a few minutes. These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.  Also, according to the wiki page on Algorithmic Trading, 92% of trades on the foreign exchange currency market are done by computers. I dunno how much is done on the NYSE, but I'd bet on it being fuckin' substantial.  Basically, I wouldn't call market halts market manipulation. I'm not saying they're right, I just mean it's not someone on the phone saying "oh shit stop the trades". There's much better evidence of market manipulation. The halts aren't that evidence.  Also, halts happen quicker on the way up, and slower on the way down. If a stock drops from $1,000 to $900, then that's a 10% drop and it's halted. But if a stock goes from $50 to $60, that's a 20% increase, and the stock would be halted twice. If the halts are based on percentages, then it makes sense that it would be halted more going up than down. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying it's how the market works, for all stocks.  Trading halts: https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current  You can also look up "LULD" which means "limit up limit down" for more info.|2021-03-10 12:48:36

Huge deal everyone going to make a billion cents.      $RKT gearing up for a huge explosion. Be ahead on this one. HUGE option interest (more than AMC)     $AMC this thing can go to $20 today.      $GME we will see 100% today to $500. This will be a level where a lot of people start taking huge gains...

qfxlmo|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|18|So I overheard my ex-wifes boyfriend saying the he thinks the $NVDA play in response to the chip shortage news is a mistake.  He thinks its a complete misread of the problem, and of what these companies actually do.  $NVDA doesn't manufacture their own chips.  Almost everyone buys them from $TSM. $NVDA, $AMD, etc, only design and assemble the chips manufactured elsewhere.  $TSM is low on chips because A. The demand is high.  And B. punative measure by the mainland on Taiwan if affecting the $TSM supply chain.  So I don't think $TSM is the play either, because I know the CCP wants to destroy that company and take their customers. Although maybe in the short term they will be able to raise prices due to demand, I don't know.   The US *really* needs their own domestic chip factory on US mainland soil.  It's a huge national security weakness.  Please let me know what you think on the matter. I think he is almost done fucking my ex-wife, so I will be able to discuss with him your replies.  And try not to make the response retarded so I don't look stupid in front of him.|2021-03-10 07:18:55

With 'hedgies' going silent the last days and no trading restrictions, I don't see why this thing can't just simply explode.

qh5tsd|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|13|Halts are done to reduce volatility. These are circuit breakers that happen when a stock has a massive swing within a few minutes. These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.  Also, according to the wiki page on Algorithmic Trading, 92% of trades on the foreign exchange currency market are done by computers. I dunno how much is done on the NYSE, but I'd bet on it being fuckin' substantial.  Basically, I wouldn't call market halts market manipulation. I'm not saying they're right, I just mean it's not someone on the phone saying "oh shit stop the trades". There's much better evidence of market manipulation. The halts aren't that evidence.

qfv9mi|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|4|# The Tech Stocks Rebound Is a Dinosaur Brain Event  The tail has been bitten, but the signal hasn't reached the control center yet.  The brontosaurus symbolizes the stock market, and the key point is that giant dinosaurs were exceptionally slow on the uptake.  In the fixed income markets the disease – best characterized as the questioning of previously blind faith – slowly spreads: a little widening of the junk bond spread here and a little tightening of private equity credit there. But as yet the equity market seems totally unaffected with volatile and risky stocks still making the running. Although the brontosaurus has been bitten on the tail, the message has not yet reached its **tiny** brain, but is proceeding up the long backbone, one vertebra at a time.  The similarities with the market moves of the last few days are obvious. A few weeks ago, the brontosaurus’s brain at last got wind of the rise in bond yields, and began to grasp that valuations may no longer be sustainable. Cue a huge rotation toward stocks that would benefit from higher yields and reflation.  Then on Tuesday came the moment when the brontosaurus twisted its giant neck to see what was happening, and gave itself and everyone riding on its back a terrible case of whiplash.|2021-03-10 06:54:24

I am fairly certain a large portion of the people hyping don't even own shares.  I know for CERTAIN that a large portion of these people have no clue how stocks work in any capacity.

qgrll1|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|11|For the people who keep asking for candles ELI5:  Candle represents a period of time. This is adjustable. Can be a minute, hour, day, etc.   Red candle means price dropped over that span. Top of the rectangle (body) was the price at the start of that time interval, bottom of the rectangle was the price at the end. Top of the upper line (wick) was the high price during that time, bottom of the lower wick was the low price during that time.   Green candle means price increased over that span. Bottom of the body was the price at the start of that time interval, top of the body was the price at the end. Again, top of the upper wick was the high price during that time, bottom of the lower wick was the low price during that time.   A long lower wick means, despite large price drops, pressure kept it up. A long upper wick means people kept selling when it would jump to take profit|2021-03-10 11:04:46

That's 10 million more than EA which made 8 times more in revenue in 2020. That is about 150% more than Take Two that made about 3.2x more revenue than Roblox in 2020.

qfuy71|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|7|Yesterday during the opening dip a bought another share at 212, the GME never returned to that price, sat there the day before when it was in the high 150’s and wanted to buy below in the 140’s, GME never went there.  Lesson of the story: I pulled the trigger and said fuck it. It cost me more the next day and bumped my average up 10 bucks but I’m glad I got in before it went even higher  Edit: clarification|2021-03-10 06:50:53

qh6smi|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|5|Halts are done to reduce volatility. These are circuit breakers that happen when a stock has a massive swing within a few minutes. These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.  Also, according to the wiki page on Algorithmic Trading, 92% of trades on the foreign exchange currency market are done by computers. I dunno how much is done on the NYSE, but I'd bet on it being fuckin' substantial.  Basically, I wouldn't call market halts market manipulation. I'm not saying they're right, I just mean it's not someone on the phone saying "oh shit stop the trades". There's much better evidence of market manipulation. The halts aren't that evidence.  Also, halts happen quicker on the way up, and slower on the way down. If a stock drops from $1,000 to $900, then that's a 10% drop and it's halted. But if a stock goes from $50 to $60, that's a 20% increase, and the stock would be halted twice. If the halts are based on percentages, then it makes sense that it would be halted more going up than down. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying it's how the market works, for all stocks.   Trading halts: https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current  You can also look up "LULD" which means "limit up limit down" for more info.|2021-03-10 12:36:50

qglkcg|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|13|I don’t really think the threat of a GME short squeeze is there anymore  What’s driving the price up now is that a bunch of retards that know nothing about stocks keep buying shares and holding to try to cause a short squeeze  Which is driving the price up slowly (for GME, the gains pace would be insane for other stocks) but consistently the last few days  We’re not seeing the rapid swings like first go around because big funds aren’t touching it  Apes will prob downvote tho   Long term, buying this price is stupid but short term you might see some alright gains. If you truly believe GME is worth 20 billion or whatever and is destined to grow, go ahead and buy. But I seriously doubt|2021-03-10 10:25:06

These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards.

qg4bs0|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|3|Set up a TD account for my gf, we deposited $500 early last week that has cleared on her bank end and says available to withdraw and funds available to trade on TD. Again she has the $500 on TD that shows as available to withdraw and available to trade. I tried to set a buy order for today's IPO and the orders are getting rejected because "You do not have enough available cash/buying power for this order due to recently deposited funds still on hold."   HOWEVER, when I try to buy apple, gamestonk, and anything else it lets me put the order in and says nothing about not having funds. Anyone have some insight as to why they are blocking me from doing this?   Additional info: I was able to set a buy order on today's IPO with $800 that I deposited yesterday in my personal account. Also on a TD cash account. So I'm unsure why I am getting the rejection on my gf account.|2021-03-10 08:20:18

They do it because the hedgies feed them 'inside' information to mislead the public into panic selling - then when things drop they clean up the cheap shares from all those with paper hands. Rinse repeat - create the narrative - program the algo and enjoy the tendies. The only thing they can't control is GME because we like the stock so much|2021-03-10 07:48:59

qgnadw|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|5|This bull run leading up to the treasury bond auction is NOT good. For those who don't know, there will be a treasury bond auction today at 2pm ET. If big money doesn't find the rates attractive, they WILL spike up. This is because there are more compelling investment alternatives such as stocks and ETFs at the moment. It's almost like a battle between the two. Big money will sway towards government bonds if rates spike up.  TLDR: Hold your butts today @ 2pm and hope that investors buy the fucking bonds at lower rates. Otherwise we may go back to SPY 380|2021-03-10 10:36:30

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)  &#x200B;    CONSUMER PRICE INDEX – FEBRUARY 2021    The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.4 percent   in February on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in January,   the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months,   the all items index increased 1.7 percent before seasonal adjustment.    The gasoline index continued to increase, rising 6.4 percent in February and   accounting for over half of the seasonally adjusted increase in the all items   index. The electricity and natural gas indexes also increased, and the energy   index rose 3.9 percent over the month. The food index rose 0.2 percent in   February, with the index for food at home and the index for food away from   home both rising.     The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.1 percent in February.   The indexes for shelter, recreation, medical care, and motor vehicle insurance   all increased over the month. The indexes for airline fares, used cars and   trucks, and apparel all declined in February.     The all items index rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending February, a   larger increase than the 1.4-percent reported for the period ending in January.   The index for all items less food and energy rose 1.3 percent over the last 12   months, a smaller increase than the 1.4-percent rise for the 12 months ending   January. The food index rose 3.6 percent over the last 12 months, while the   energy index increased 2.4 percent over that period.|2021-03-10 07:49:53

qfqim0|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|8|Dear Netflix. This should be the plot of the GME/WSB movie.  Cohen invests in GME. DFV invests in GME. Everybody laughs at him. The squeeze starts happening. DFV makes millions and secures money while diamond holding GME after (the plot twist) ROBINHOOD blocks people from buying GME. Squeeze goes down, is heavily shorted again.  People are being laughed at. DFV doubles his position. MOASS happens. The good guys win. TADA.  But Im  a gay bear so it should continue as follows: MOASS happens. People are millionaires. But some people still hold and when DFV sells they call him a paper bitch although they only know about GME and trading for a month now. While many make large sums, many still hold and yell 10 WORLD GDP is not a meme. This was not the real squeeze. Melvin has covered. Many will baghold. Many will sue DFV although he never gave any financial advice. He wins in court but one salty bagholder picks him off with a sniper. DFV is remembered dearly. Shooter dies in a shootout. People start idolizing DFV as their messiah.   P.S. I just like this movie idea. I dont want DFV to die.|2021-03-10 05:57:13

qg0b3z|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|3|I think the market has this all wrong. Monetary policy wasn't going to change even if the CPI was higher. The CPI is saying that there is no inflation. This is DEFLATIONARY.   When you have inflation, asset prices (stocks, real estate, etc.) go up. When you have deflation, asset prices go down. The market has this all backwards. Deflation should terrify the markets. In a deflationary scenario, stocks go down.|2021-03-10 07:44:57

Actually DPOs lead to lower prices and more fair price discovery. This is because all shares are unlocked to buy and sell.  Unlike an IPO where shares owned by funds prior to the IPO date are usually not traded.  Higher number of shares in the market = more supply = lower price. You're lucky that RBLX did a DPO and not IPO.|2021-03-10 14:05:58

qfsvnl|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|7|Thank you!  The following is comments i posted on other god tier DD yesterday and I was highly encouraged to post my thoughts in a discussion post so figured I would hijack here .. feel free to critique and again I *want* to be optimistically wrong ! Cheers!  Sorry if out of context just copy/paste.  ---------------------------------@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  I am likely a novice compared to someone that calls themself a technical trader, but I know math, and I can absorb DD and info at super ape rates. It makes sense to me that the dramatic lower volume compared to Jans run up is contributed to the ability, or lack of ability, of the shorts. The past few days movement has appeared as organic stock growth reacting to current news and events. It just wasn't super suppressed by absurd shorting and wasn't heavily influenced by a gamma squeeze. Calm volume, organic growth. It appears as if GME is currently in a vacuum of being able to be itself, without dramatic artifical movement forces.   One could theorize from that, that -   *public sentiment and awareness is high (by previous comparison)   *diamonds hands forge on   *The screwed HFs are observing the situation and planning their next course. Going full retard themselves didn't work as it usually has. Going even fuller retard could just prove to be foolish and result in a worse outcome for them. Perhaps they've been warned. Perhaps MMs reaction to the new DTCC rule (that hasn't been enacted yet) is to prepare ahead of time for it, so as to not let HFs continue to dig their hole.   Tl;dr IMO GeeMEee currently experiencing pure organic growth. Stock not influenced either up or down. ALL technicals point to bullish and 🚀🚀🚀. Gamma squeeze will still occur but hasn't for this week yet. Short squeeze can occur at any point during the party. DTCC rule once in affect will force the short squeeze and prevent future ones.   --------------------------------------------@@@@@@@@@@@@@   Second comment ....   Thank you! If you're interested in other thoughts floating my ape brain ..   I think that , as is in other DD, we are in the Jan squeeze comparable rise. With that info, a couple things to consider...   *1 Jan's squeeze was artificially held down AND THEN our precious BUY button was removed. A comment aired on TV from hedgie that it would have gotten into the thousands. Thousands, in Jan.   *2 No illegal manipulation this time (right?)   *3 VW short squeeze looking very identical to our current situation, obligatory "you are here". Given that VW biggest spike went 3X over its cat ear spikes .. we could theorize 3X our cat ears.   *4 But our cat ears were manipulated and buy button removed.   *5 1+2+3+4 = ... [("thousands" x3) + new developments. Company actually worth a much higher theoretical value now compared to before. + new DTCC rule (MMs prepping)]   Oh boy. Oh let's not forget about the potential gamma and short squeezes! Hell.   Bold prediction that I actually WANT to be wrong: $1K-$5K THIS WEEK. NOT FROM SHORT SQUEEZE.   Why do I want it to be wrong? Further movement will occur from actual short squeeze, likely NEXT WEEK. $1K-$5K this week will test the hardest of diamond hands, especially if they make it to the weekend. Especially if Monday goes red. Oye. Will the rocket fail? Hell no. Will most of people miss it, thinking its the top when its not? I fully believe so.   Time will tell and shit I'm in part typing this out loud so the universe will laugh and ill be wrong. I want to be wrong as fuck. Hell, I want to see a decrease tomorrow. I don't want diamond hands to be tested so severely this week when it might truly pop next week. People will see the moon and forget we're going to Andromeda. At this point the biggest win a losing HF can get is to shake off as many poors as they can from the rocket just for laughs.. We'll see I suppose. Under $600 this week would give me a very stress free weekend.|2021-03-10 06:26:46

GME doesn’t drop because you have people who stupidly believe it’ll hit 100k and have balls like no other to hold with no account for opportunity cost as their stock plummets from $300 to $40. Of course the stock doesn’t drop, they don’t sell lol that doesn’t go for 99% of the other stocks on the market, apart from index funds, which are also stable in such a manner|2021-03-10 09:51:34

LG OLED demand will go up as people upgrade consoles and we’re just in the beginning of this. Apple also uses LG displays. When you’re the best at something, that automatically makes you valuable.   I recommended GME at $4 and was downvoted to hell and I think banned a few times. Take LPL seriously. Good luck!|2021-03-10 12:49:34

qgb3k3|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|3|Hey can somebody help explain this to me? AMC just passed its break even point for me, so shouldn’t I be at around 0% profits? This call option is saying I’m at over 100% profits. And does that mean I should use Black-Scholes and find a price to sell at soon? Or should I let it go higher but lose the potential profits value (intrinsic/extrinsic? Idk man)? I believe in AMC going to at least $15, but realistically by my expiry date of 3/19 I’m hoping for around $12.50 https://i.imgur.com/S8bCK4Y.jpg  I just watched a video on all of this stuff yesterday but honestly it was a lot of info to take in and I had just finished a few hours of coding so it didn’t absorb into my brain too well apparently  EDIT: I think I originally asked this around 20-30min ago so the current profit is higher|2021-03-10 09:13:16

qgn88n|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|4|The only reason I can even think gme would be back up this high is the brokerages that let people take out bets or contracts and the stock needs to close lower than a certain dollar amount for those traders to profit  The brokerages use their whales to get it up and therefore the big bettors lose .  And then lose more because most take out the the contracts to cover their loss on first bet.   At this point anyone buying in would have to have a lot to lose.  Either way manipulation isn't cool and a lot will get hurt again.|2021-03-10 10:36:06

qgngcx|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|3|This bull run leading up to the treasury bond auction is NOT good. For those who don't know, there will be a treasury bond auction today at 2pm ET. If big money doesn't find the rates attractive, they WILL spike up. This is because there are more compelling investment alternatives such as stocks and ETFs at the moment. It's almost like a battle between the two. Big money will sway towards government bonds if rates spike up.  TLDR: Hold your butts today @ 2pm and hope that investors buy the fucking bonds at lower rates. Otherwise we may go back to SPY 380|2021-03-10 10:37:38

I get that it’s a meme stock, and the mentality surrounding it is extra retard, but it makes money.   I’ve been up since December really, and while a lot of people have been getting fucked, GME has been performing.

This means that despite the money printing and stimulus, we don't get inflation because the private sector credit collapses faster than the fed can print and faster than the government can spend.  Interest rates rising is bullish because that means that Jpow has to print more money to keep yields down.   Market has it all backwards IMO.

It's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth, but you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody.

qh0p03|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|2|I'm not a short, never shorted a stock. But if you're an institutional investor watching this. This is the strategy I'd use.  &#x200B;  I'd start picking off the meme stocks from their popularity ranking.  3rd rate tier popularity:  First ones to get shot: Pelaton, Redfin, Wish, stocks that are part of the meme culture but arent cult favorites among financial youtubers or charlatans. Watch the videos of Meet Kevin, Financial Education, positive investing and other tools.  2nd rate popularity  Second ones to get shot:  Enphase,CCIV, SPCE, HIMS, SFT-Stocks that were once in favor but are losing popularity among the meme culture  &#x200B;  1st rate:Nio, TTCF, Palantir, FSK,  Basically anything  that has a strong cult following on social media. These will be the last to go, as many of their holders are convinced they made a good investment and will be the last to stand down.  &#x200B;  GOD MODE: The ultimate dragon, MEME LORD  Tesla  Do not attempt to slay this dragon unless you have a lvl 99 Burry Sword.|2021-03-10 11:57:56

And in the darkness of chaos, they fooled Crom, and they took from him the enigma of steel. Crom was angered. And the Earth shook. Fire and wind struck down these giants, and they threw their bodies into the waters, but in their rage, the gods forgot the secret of steel and left it on the battlefield. We who found it are just men. Not gods. Not giants. Just men. The secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery. You must learn its riddle, Conan. You must learn its discipline. For no one - no one in this world can you trust. Not men, not women, not beasts... \[points to **GME shares**\] This you can trust.     \-Conan the Barbarian's Father|2021-03-10 11:52:11

r0tnwj|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|1|Looking for a discussion about $CAE / $CAE.TO  I wanted to talk a bit about $CAE. I have been long on CAE for some time and have made almost 100% on it since the drop in March (I was fortunate enough to nearly time the bottom). Since then I've been trying to figure out what to do next.  CAE is a diversified manufacturer of Flight Simulators primarily. They also have some other things, like ventilators, which I see as more of a distraction than anything else.  CAE has spent the last year consolidating the industry through very interesting acquisitions. Their size is allowing them to do things that their competitors can not in the M&A space. This is their most recent, and largest, acquisition [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127785/0/en/CAE-acquires-Flight-Simulation-Company.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127785/0/en/CAE-acquires-Flight-Simulation-Company.html).  CAE is the leader in this space and I originally bought them last year because I saw the need for training for the 737 Max (pre covid) as being a huge opportunity for them as airlines scramble to get pilots certified. I think that, plus the 1-year slowdown of aviation, combine to be a double bonus for CAE. Trading at about $35 they are nearing their 52 weeks high of $39 but I think they can blow well past $39 given the pent up demand in the industry, their position in the marketplace, and their cash on hand which gives them the ability to work quickly.  Airlines around the world are currently ramping back up and will need to get their pilots recertified in many cases. This can only be good news for CAE and, for that reason, I'm now looking at options and increasing my position.   I'm curious if anyone else has given CAE much thought and if you have an opinion.|2021-03-15 10:42:20

qg04vs|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|-6|I tried to post this but it got removed. I'm not sure why. It is a post I found on r/stocks that I wanted to share here.  \-----------------------------------   This was posted on [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) credit to [u/Tepllhcgftwhdg](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tepllhcgftwhdg/)  I just wanted to post it here as it gives a very good explanation of naked short selling. Sorry in advance if this is not allowed.  I made a PDF, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to share google drive links. PM me if you want the link for an PDF of all 10 parts combined.  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A 10 part series that will clearly explain what is going on with Naked Shorting in Stock Market  [**Resources**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Resources%22&restrict_sr=1)  Get your tinfoil hat out, its time to see what you think you want to see but don't really want to. This is perfect for any newbie trying to understand what is going on and how the system has ended up the way it has.  Tl;Dr at end.  There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** [u/bEAc0n](https://www.reddit.com/u/bEAc0n/)) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.  This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.  I sent him an email and this was his response  >Thanks for the kind words.   No problem with your request. Here is the link you should give them.   [https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting](https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting) (This is Part 10)   If there is any movement formed to take on illegal naked shorting, I would be happy to contribute. I have been consistently frustrated in trying to get media or politicians interested.  **Read part 8 if you want to hear about CEDE and how once a counterfeit share is created it is forever viewed as a legitimate share unless if the company bring all shares back into itself to verify them (basically once counterfeited it exists forever, as a shareholder meet only verifies the shares owned by the ppl who will vote iirc)**  [**Part 1**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-1-in-a-series-of-reports-on-blatant-widespread-stock-manipulation-that-is-enabled-by-illegal-naked-shorting/)**,** [**Part 2**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-2-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-conventional-wisdom-on-how-illegal-short-sales-are-executed/)**,** [**Part 3**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/)**,** [**Part 4**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-4-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-who-are-the-key-players/)**,** [**Part 5**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-5-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-traditional-shorting-compared-to-naked-shorting-both-legal-and-illegal/)**,** [**Part 6**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-6-illegal-naked-shorting-the-secs-regulation-sho-is-intended-to-prevent-illegal-naked-shorting-but-is-ineffective/)**,** [**Part 7**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-7-illegal-naked-shorting-dtcc-continuous-net-settlement-and-stock-borrowing-programs-have-loopholes-that-facilitate-illegal-naked-shorting/)**,** [**Part 8**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-8-illegal-naked-shorting-series-who-or-what-is-cede-and-what-role-does-cede-play-in-the-trading-of-stocks/)**,** [**Part 9**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-10-of-illegal-naked-shorting-series-the-risk-reward-of-shorting-versus-buying-stocks-is-extremely-unfavorable/)**,** [**Part 10**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-10-of-illegal-naked-shorting-series-legal-shorting-of-stocks-is-a-losers-game-but-illegal-naked-shorting-transforms-it-into-a-winners-game/)  This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series  >**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**   Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**  **TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**|2021-03-10 07:43:24

qfvybc|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|-31|Honestly, every $10,$20 $100/week GME goes up there’s super limited upside. 50->100 was risky, 100->200 was risky, 150->300 is ballsy, 300-600 seems unlikely IMO  I posted my gain so I’m out, but best of luck to those with stronger hands than me *rip my karma*|2021-03-10 07:01:47

They might want to cover a lot of them tomorrow and then short again at $500 on Friday when it reached that point, but it might only drop it to around $400.  If this stock is not going above $1600 before the stimulus check, you'll have tons of new/low capital investors rushing in and boost the stock price even higher.  $5000 is not a meme anymore.|2021-03-10 14:48:45

Seems like it was a singular whale that did it, happened while I was taking a shit too.  My paper account was still up 725% after the pull on the turn up ("closed" my position then, guess I should have gone real monies heh), but I'm, curious if there was any way to see that pull.

qhe1qn|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|-10|Hello, I am in a little bit of a dilemma, I bought 3,000 Roblox shares this morning from a broker I found on Craigslist. He said he would transfer the shares to my Robinhood account after I Western Union'd him the money. I should mention he gave me a great deal at $55/share (I assumed it would open well over $55/share and I was right) so i was eager to jump on it before someone else took the opportunity. I sent him the money over 5 hours ago and my account still has not received the shares and Robinhood does not have a customer service number to assist me with this ACATS transfer. Any help would be appreciated....|2021-03-10 13:26:24

I placed a market sell order yesterday before market close, and was told it would be fulfilled today at market open, but it is still open.  I invest with schwab and the sell order is about 4k split between a tech index and a target date.  This delay has killed my attempt at getting into an investment at a good price point.  Any information as to why this is happening and he to avoid in the future would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!|2021-03-10 10:10:07

qhawvp|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|-13|Halts are done to reduce volatility. These are circuit breakers that happen when a stock has a massive swing within a few minutes. These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.  Also, according to the wiki page on Algorithmic Trading, 92% of trades on the foreign exchange currency market are done by computers. I dunno how much is done on the NYSE, but I'd bet on it being fuckin' substantial.  Basically, I wouldn't call market halts market manipulation. I'm not saying they're right, I just mean it's not someone on the phone saying "oh shit stop the trades". There's much better evidence of market manipulation. The halts aren't that evidence.  Also, halts happen quicker on the way up, and slower on the way down. If a stock drops from $1,000 to $900, then that's a 10% drop and it's halted. But if a stock goes from $50 to $60, that's a 20% increase, and the stock would be halted twice. If the halts are based on percentages, then it makes sense that it would be halted more going up than down. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying it's how the market works, for all stocks.  There's just fewer halts on the way down than the way up.  Trading halts: https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current  GME's been halted seven times today the last time I revised this. *If I am wrong about any of this, please let me know.*  GME was halted after it dropped from like $337 to $302 for five minutes, then halted for five minutes again when it started trading again and dropped from $277.21 to $248.68, then it repeated when it dropped to $216, and then $198. Let me know if any of this is wrong, I don't want to be spreading misinformation.  You can also look up "LULD" which means "limit up limit down" for more info.|2021-03-10 13:04:42

qfneu6|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|-35|I say no to a higher minimum wage because it will price certain jobs out of the market. Every time the minimum wage goes up employment goes down. This is a fact.   Also because I was at Taco Bell/Pizza Hut three weeks ago and I ordered a supreme pizza from the Pizza Hut portion as a contrast to the three Taco Bell things I had already ordered. I always request a side or marinara sauce which they insist on calling “breadstick sauce” because many of these people are very surface. The woman forgot the sauce, then told me they didn’t have it, then told me they had it but they were going to charge me extra for it. I lost it. I said to this woman “I’ll kill you. I’ll legitimately kill you when your shift is over. I’ll wait for you and kill you in the parking lot”.   It’s important to remember companies will just replace workers with touch screen computers and other forms of technology to offset costs. She then laughed at me which further enraged me. “You are getting murdered tonight do you hear me? Where’s my fucking sauce. I’m gonna stab you in the parking lot when you leave”.   Unemployment among young people is very high and demanding companies pay 15 dollars an hour for an entry level job may cause them to cut hours or eliminate the job completely. This was a white woman who spoke the language perfectly. She heard me order sauce. She refused to provide it because she was hoarding it to feed her neglected children. I tried to look deadly, stared directly at her, and began to mouth the words “You’re fucking dead.”   You can’t invent wages in a free market. “This isn’t a joke. I’m going to rip the skin off your face” That made her slightly uncomfortable and she said “I’m calling the police”. As I drove away I screamed “This is your last night on earth whore”. The living wage argument is a complex issue. And hopefully we opt for a market based solution as more well meaning government controls will have unintended consequences.|2021-03-10 05:13:10

qfxnrj|m1v1e6|m1v1e6|-68|Big boys are slowly letting the stock go up again and gently throwing the bait to Keith Gill (DFV). My guess he is going to double down on his position and going all in, then they will pull the trigger and crash the stock. One thing for sure, I will never fight the fed and bet against the big whales. We are 0.001% when it comes to moving the tide.  Just a wild guess :) What are you predictions?|2021-03-10 07:19:32
