fqqu57|q35qc8|q35qc8|12|Everything about puts is fuk  Premiums on puts are directly comparable to calls but the chance of calls hitting is substantially greater.  Especially long dated calls.  Selling secured puts otm requires you to have cash "Cash covered puts" and when you are forced to cover it is a losing proposition all around because you ended up getting a tanking stock.  Selling Covered Calls otm means the worst thing that happens is you need to sell a stock for gains and get a premium.  Puts are only really good if you have strong conviction of something going down soon.  Otherwise it is just a case of "Timing the market".

I know there's a good case for shorting this stock, but there is potential for calls to print in the next few weeks if Vlad keeps making improvements and bad PR dissipates.   My calls for tomorrow are fucked unless Cathie buys a controlling interest in the company, but there is hope for  the coming weeks.

fpnur9|q35qc8|q35qc8|3|Perion Network bouncing off a beautiful triple bottom, going to test $22 again shortly (likely today) and will definitely smash through imo. Valued at 1x revenue, very profitable, growing 35-40% YoY, and valued 4-10x less than their same industry peers with the same performance. They just made a great acquisition (accretive immediately), raised 2021 and 2022 guidance for the second time in the quarter, and got bumped to a $40 price target by Oppenheimer yesterday. Extremely diverse ad tech powerhouse flying completely under the radar.        It's my highest conviction multibagger for the next year.

fq0fga|q35qc8|q35qc8|2|After I returned to the U.S., I obtained a document showing a detailed account of Tether Holdings‚Äô reserves. It said they include billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese companies‚Äîsomething money-market funds avoid. And that was before one of the country‚Äôs largest property developers, China Evergrande Group, started to collapse. I also learned that Tether had lent billions of dollars more to other crypto companies, with Bitcoin as collateral. One of them is Celsius Network Ltd., a giant quasi-bank for cryptocurrency investors, its founder Alex Mashinsky told me. He said he pays an interest rate of 5% to 6% on $1 billion in loans from Tether. Tether has denied holding any Evergrande debt, but Hoegner, Tether‚Äôs lawyer, declined to say whether Tether had other Chinese commercial paper. He said the vast majority of its commercial paper has high grades from credit ratings firms, and that its secured loans are low-risk, because borrowers have to put up Bitcoin that‚Äôs worth more than what they borrow. ‚ÄúAll Tether tokens are fully backed,‚Äù he said.|2021-10-07 07:44:03

Check out **Cliodynamics** if anyone gets an urge to look it up,it's an interesting way of looking at stuff (it aint no cult religion for sure:) .. - it wont make you profit the same way as a meme can gain you 10% in a day, but memes are totally part of it, and so are "gut feelings" just as much as the Fed announcements, or economic reports from Deutsche Bank or TV bullshit .. And I aint selling anything. I'm just saying "something going down" You don't feel it at all?  I just have a feeling it's time to scrap being financially "anti Chinese" (because there is a lot of that around aint there? - for some strange ECONOMIC reason, it's a standard WSB joke, right?), screw that and start looking at what is going to be profitable and how governments as well as companies are adjusting right now. Change happening.  Because **the world changed last month** (wtf why, you tell me?  make up your own narrative), the market floors changed, the **feeling** changed, .. maybe 3-5 weeks ago or so? - and now we aint on the same planet.  My GUESS is all the DD you did up to now - **scrap it** and start doing it agan from scratch. Do yourself a favor.  that's what I'm doing, and if Im 100% wrong it aint no skin off your nose, right? - Ive been wrong before.  have a nice day.  checkout some new processes maybe.|2021-10-07 11:56:06
