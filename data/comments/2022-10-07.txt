remaco|xxv1h2|xxv1h2|71|So good jobs numbers was bad, because it means the economy is still too good, which means the fed can raise interest rates more which is bad, but will lower inflation which is good. So now we hope for millions of Americans to lose their jobs (which would be bad) in the hopes of causing a real bad recession which would actually be good?

This doesn't bode well for businesses selling "things", and the shit is just beginning to hit the fan.

January expiry yesterday at close.  Will continue to add when I see fit (not chasing 1000% returns).  [https://imgur.com/a/i4Q5Jsi](https://imgur.com/a/i4Q5Jsi)  I feel confident. I believe this might be the beginning of another lows retest. Today seems to be a strong downtrend day. I will set a stop loss (not tight) and relax.

What do 94 years old multi-millionare or eben billionaire do with money? Keep it in an offshore account with very little movement between investments.   What do their kids and grandkids do when they inherited? Big house. Oh I know let's buy a Maserati. What about a condo in Tulum? My friend said that we should be investment in NFT's. Let's buy $doge too. Inbest in $tsla??? Fuk yea. Oh, let's go on a trip to Tokyo *JUST* to go clothes shopping. You know that Morton's we go to every Thursday night? Let's buy it. What about that electric scooter company, let's get in on that. Oh it's private? Let's get dude on the phone, see what we can make happen. I heard we should be investment in cannabis companies. Yeah.  So what used to be essentially inert money is going ping-pong all over the economy.   It's not poors. Inflation is primarily caused by stupid rich kids. Change my mind.|2022-10-07 11:05:32
