ffjmv7|et8xus|et8xus|20|For anyone thinking about holding calls over the weekend, bulls, bears thetas, alike...  Govern yourselves accordingly.  WHO hasn't released details about the virus' incubation period. So assume the worst is yet to come.  By that, the number of infected people and death toll will rise.  Some [professor](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3047328/china-coronavirus-may-have-come-snake-researchers-say) in Germany said peak infections might not be realized until March.  Articles I read about it last night believe infections began about 6 weeks ago - mid December.  [China notified WHO on 12/31](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/china-coronavirus-cases-rise-440-deaths-200122023126709.html).  Major news outlets only began reporting early this week, the same week Chinese quarantines began.  [One article](https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/jan/23/china-coronavirus-sars-cover-up-beijing-disease-dissent) commended China for its actions immediately following the outbreak, suggesting it learned from SARS, but [Business insider today reports](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-information-crackdown-on-wuhan-coronavirus-2020-1?utm_source=reddit.com) it's commie business as usual arresting journalists, citizens...  Who knows what's going on.  The good news, (if you can ever call something like this "good") is that the virus affects elderly individuals and those with health issues - diabetes, heart disease, etc. - more than it does younger, healthier individuals.  SARS caused an 8% sell off, but rose 18% over next 6 months. MERS caused a .8% sell off, but S&P rose 15% the following 6 months. [Source](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/01/15166413/a-history-of-coronavirus-outbreaks-and-the-stock-market)  JPow may have turned up the market's difficulty level, from Beginner to Easy mode, by decreasing the frequency and amount of REPO injections, but I'll let you all decide whether you think if the FOMC would further decrease REPO or raise rates in the short term in light of this uncertainty.  Edit:  I'm trying to keep my own advice out of this.  I sold 1/31 BABA calls for a 4 figure loss this morning despite the fact that I think BABA will rock it's earnings report on Wednesday.

fev3kr|et8xus|et8xus|1|Hey boys, recovering bear here trying to join bull gang. A question though if anyone is feeling generous enough this morning to help me out: yesterday I was running bull call spreads on NFLX 342.5/345c and TSLA 570/572.5c 1/31 expiry so with an expected max profit of $250 on each.   Both traded above the upper strike but when I went to close  my profit on each spread was like $100. Is this because the strikes were too close so the deltas on each option were the same? And would I just have to hold to expiry to get the max profit?|2020-01-24 05:53:53
