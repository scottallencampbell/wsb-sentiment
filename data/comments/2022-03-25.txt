These traders attempt to call tops and bottoms in the market by trading reversals in strong trending markets. This goes completely against the fundamental concept of, ‘The trend is your friend'. Strong upward trending markets combined with extreme net-short client positioning, results in a bullish signal.  Currently there's more short sellers and FED and ECB is pumping today.

21tv9j|tnij9c|tnij9c|17|Here's my stock market journey that no one cares  Started in October, made a few bucks on dwac.  Then go straight to semi-con, made a few bucks til I decided to go all in on Draftkings and Robinhood since I thought there's gonna be a 'Santa Rally' for these beat up stocks.  \-40% for the new year, another -20% trying to short the market as it rebounds.  Every month during this period, I deposit majority of my salary and eat shit for food.  Every day I look at my portfolio shrink, and when the market drops big, that is the exact day earlier i decided to close my short and go long instead, the day I go long it falls off a cliff.  Most recently, I rotated back to some small caps stocks with good financials and solid foundation, these shits don't move at all as market rebound, sometimes spy go crazy and my shit is like +0.24%. I would have made at least 40% back if i stayed with shit growth stocks.  Kill me![img](emotet5_2th526880)|2022-03-25 06:03:42

Most come to the daily threads to talk about general market sentiment/movement and scream bul/ber fuk. The second you apes show up, the daily thread goes down the drain. Yes, you can legit make money off of GME and I'm happy for those who did. Congrats to you!     We are just tired of hearing about it and getting flooded with it.

My dad would sit in line for 5 hours to get just enough gas to drive to work. And then they said, "you can only buy gas on Monday, Wednesday or Friday" and then places just stopped selling it|2022-03-25 11:18:16

21qgjj|tnij9c|tnij9c|6|TLRY got to be the play today.  If you already have high stock then average down.  If you don't have anything buy whatever you can afford (stock or options).  Either way things will continue to climb towards the vote. If the vote is positive then it moons. If the vote isn't positive then there will be a dip until the next time. And there will be a next time, and eventually the vote will pass.  This is why I'm in on shares rather than options. It seems like a safer long term play (albeit with less returns).|2022-03-25 05:21:45

22ek8s|tnij9c|tnij9c|4|I picked up 1 AMZN 3090p 4/14. I still have the 2 AMZN 3070p 4/08. This one gives another week and is 20 strikes higher, So, if you're still looking at getting into then possibility of an AMZN reversal, you haven't missed it, but I suggest to shift a week forward.  Right now, I really need to hear some tickers that might be going up. I'd like to take a contrary position to this. If there is a whole market reversal, there will be pressure upwards and these puts might not make it. So I want something that is likely to go up and will move more if a market reverses. Does that make sense? We're covered both ways then.  I'd prefer something that's in the bottom 15% of an upwardly moving channel.|2022-03-25 09:07:08

22trlh|tnij9c|tnij9c|5|Srs Question  - are hedge fund algos designed to inverse the most obvious plays in the short term in order to shake out retail investors?  reason why I asked is whenever I think an options/stock play is obvious in the short term, the inverse ALWAYS happens and I always lose money.  Example - Affirm ran up 70%, on absolutely nothing. I shorted when it hit 50% up for 5 days in a row, thinking there was no way in hell it keeps going up with th environment. well, it shot up another 20% so I closed my options that were down 75%. day after I sold it comes crashing down.  Similar to Lucid/Rivian  - though they were gauranteed shorts, ended up continously losing money as these stocks stayed proppped up even after terrible earnings reports while the rest of the nasdaq headed into a severe correction. They only fell a few weeks after my options expired.  It salmost like the algos know. Almost like I viable strategy is to pick plays that seems obvious, and inverse them in the short term.  Example: no one thinks tesla will keep going up in this market and  buying above 1k seems stupid. So, the inverse strategy is to actually buy short term tesla calls (eventually it will go down).|2022-03-25 10:49:15

22te27|tnij9c|tnij9c|2|i think biden is going to make a huge policy mistake when oil goes to 200, he is going to ban oil exports. Which is retarded, but so is burning the SPR. This will send WTI to zero/negative as cushin backs up and send brent to 400. Because we have more sweet light than we need, and need to import heavies. This will basically completely screw oil & gas production in the country for the next 10 years while ensuring gas stations will go empty by July.

23xlmv|tnij9c|tnij9c|2|alright just let go of 15,000$ in calls these two and only paid 1,500$! They were at their peak this week ~21k so i kept the majority of it out but theta gaped me last half of the week. Super duper obvious in hindsight. Shouldve known everybody on the planet was gonna be a massively entitled little bitch boy after we finally got some positive green after MONTHS of decay. Seriously. Yall need to get real. It cant be doom and gloom all the time. It’s also incredibly hard to time this perfectly even when you geel it in your gut sometimes. I will not give up and i will be back with the ither people who have faith in this market next week and month and every. Single. Fucking. Day.   You cannot kill our hopes, our dreams. I know you are all jealous because you dont have any. But some of us do, and nothing is going to stop us from pursuing those ambitions. Even if it means playing the fool for months and waiting for the opportunity while you work hard and wonder what youre working towards. Theres always light at the end. This is the real meaning behind this week the bears and negative forces wanted to scare you from. But look at where we all. Near ath. They think they can beat us down so easily because that’s where they would stop. BUT THEY CANNOT COMPREHEND OUR LIMITS. They will laugh and call it luck or drugs or random but we all know the truth. Perseverance and strength. Faith and love. Real love that connects and binds us selflessly. That deep life shit most of yall never even felt before. Guess what its real, and just because you cant feel it doesnt mean you have the right to lie and steal from hard working families who have no clue whats going on behind the scene but have just as much faith because they are GOOD PEOPLE.   Good People do Great Things. Believe in that. Believe in Being Optimistic, even if you feel stupid. It takes courage to lead into darkness, but God walks with us in the shadows of death and through the valley we see light on the other side and it’s our responsibility to rise above EVERYTHING ELSE, the snickering remarks, the bad vibes, and lead the blind not toward temptation but toward deliverence from evil in the truth that they hate but love to hide and obscure.

21xw2o|tnij9c|tnij9c|0|Been looking at this DMA law in Europe, and while it's likely to impact AAPL/GOOG revenues from the App Store as their cuts decline down to <10% from 30%, hard to see how it'll negatively impact big tech that much otherwise.  All this emphasis on "gatekeeping" via browsers/email systems and such... but that's not how big tech makes money in 2022.  Feels like a law that would have worked back in 2000-2006 but completely misses how big tech is dominant in 2022.  Big tech is sticky because of the network effects and sticky subscription services/bundles that tie into hardware.  This law doesn't really affect those significantly.  Not really surprised though because regulators are always way behind on technology.|2022-03-25 06:47:29

22ifhk|tnij9c|tnij9c|1|Not that anyone cares, but just some of my thoughts.  Trillions of $ were taken out of the market from Jan 1st to middle of March. I think the mass selloff was exacerbated by the Ukraine invasion. We've seen 2 weeks of a pretty big recovery with hundreds of billions pumped back in the market. You are even seeing a massive rally in crypto that is basically coupled with the Nasdaq. Both are basically sitting at pre-Ukraine invasion levels. But the pump is slowing down, and volume is drying up.   Does that mean that all of those billions in cash getting beached will be flushed back into the market?   🤷‍♂️   Will there be another major sell off coming?  🤷‍♂️|2022-03-25 09:34:01
