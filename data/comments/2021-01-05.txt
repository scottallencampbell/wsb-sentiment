Cities were on fire across the country. The president was on the fence about surrendering his office peacefully. We were moving battleships, planes, and submarines on our enemies and preparing to launch nuclear warfare on a global scale. What did I do? I bought call options on an old video game store and some electric Chinese stuff and became rich since stonks only go up.

i6m937|kqw962|kqw962|8|"Liberum found that the stock market, represented by the S&P 500, posted an average annual total return of 10.8% under a Democratic president, compared to just 5.6% for a Republican president, since 1947. Many would likely argue that the data is skewed to favor a Democratic president because it includes the Great Recession of 2008, and the COVID-19 induced market sell-off of 2020, both of which happened under Republican presidents. Therefore, Liberum also looked at the historical data from 1947 to 2006, which excludes both the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic.  But the data is more of the same. From 1947 to 2006, the average annual return for stocks under a Democratic president was 10.5%, versus 6.1% under a Republican president."  BLUE WAVE GO GO GO|2021-01-05 08:48:52

i6aweh|kqw962|kqw962|6|Hey guys, BBBY earnings are this week and boy howdy could this one be live.  It’s the 4th highest short percentage of all companies worth over 1billion.  If the conditions are right we could see a pretty significant squeeze, and the catalyst for this would be very strong earnings and guidance.  I don’t want to type something huge up but if you do the research yourself I think you’ll agree that given Tritons past results already this year, and how effectively they handled this holiday season, it’s a good bet he’s positioned the company well going into earnings.  Estimates have been revised upward 10% the past month for earnings, and the average PT from analysts is 24$  In the event that they beat earnings and show strong guidance, I expect to see the stock surge not only as a result of earnings, but to climb even more because of the large number of short positions which will begin to cover as a result.  This is simply my personal prediction. Good luck everyone.   My eyes are on calls all the way between 1/8, 1/15, and Feb 19.|2021-01-05 06:48:22

Because of this, the Army has 3 contractors bidding for a replacement contract... word is they will not go with Sig as they have already stated they don't want to source all of their weapons from one contractor.  They will not go with General Dynamics which is producing a bullpup, the logistics of switching over to bullpups would be an absolute nightmare....  This leaves Textron, who has paired with HK to make a badass rifle to answer this calling, a longtime defense contractor worth 19-billion that is somewhat undervalued right now.

Fidelity immediately took 10% stake running shares to 150. Today, Xi has new MOA head to push #GMO faster.  Float is 3.1M and that is fucking nothing. When this thing sees volume, it will run big. Conservative price target $100, could see $150.   E-commerce meets feeding China and solving their food insecurity problem, which is Xi’s number one initiative.   Posted this yesterday too, and none of you listened. Ticker is seed. Get rich or don’t, but this thing is going to pop big.|2021-01-05 14:05:46

They get fucked with so hard it isn't worth it, and time value means you'll be a bag holder for a long while before you can make your money back.  Much easier to just take that cash back and spend it on solid options plays.

I’m placing PUTS on the TAN ETF.    Let’s face it most / all of the solar energy companies are up well over 100% for the year due to Bide’s win and speculation on clean energy spending and re-entering the Paris Treaty.  Is that still on? I’d say yes however ask think the GA runoff will yield a split decision one seat for the Dems and one for the Rep meaning Republicans maintain a slim control of the Senate and also meaning a full blown green energy infrastructure package most likely won’t pass.    If this plays out ALL of the companies inside the TAN ETF will correct and the downgrade of First Solar is the catalyst which rolls this trade starting this morning.

They usually put an order either at your price or 5 dollars above yours. I repeat the process and see if the bidder reacts again (they usually do). I eventually drive the price up until I get bored or reach a level where I wouldn’t want the contract to be filled at the price.
