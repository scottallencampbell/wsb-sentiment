8w1b7p|e2elao|e2elao|16|Hey you tendie monsters! Time for the pre-holiday **Magical Crayons TA** because I don't expect anything else interesting to happen in the market.  [SPY is currently almost at resistance on the daily chart!](https://imgur.com/AKTUsd1) The magical number will be 315.5ish, so if we break that there's a pretty wide leg up to almost 320.   Bears may be asking-- will the beatings continue? Unfortunately, yes! Momentum indicators are still neutral-good, and while that doesn't mean "moon," it means further consolidation/runup for a few more days seems to be in order. My guess is we'll trade flatish/slight green on Friday, and [historical indicators of the market](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bfa3648a4f67889513e328a27fe8aed/9eb68188aa28edc2-7d/s1280x1920/d50acf2a785f40003bffc56a5235b994b8596a07.jpg) during the holiday season generally tells the same story!  Nothing much else to say folks. If I see changes in momentum or the market worth noting I'll check back in, but until then, remember-- even if it's a turkey tendie, a tendie is still a tendie, and that's what the holiday season is all about.|2019-11-27 13:02:53

She was super introverted, and not old enough for a bar after dinner, so it was dinner then ice cream. Thought it went fine besides the fact when reddit was brought up, I said I have one. She said she wanted to see it. I said hahaha no. Found out the same date that she's hardcore libertarian so, yeah, don't think my profile would impress her. After 3 dates and having her tongue down my throat she's like ur soo sweet but I dont feel a connection sry. I'm like ok cool no problem wish u the best.

8vmneq|e2elao|e2elao|2| [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)      "Prices rise, usually on positive news **or on the prospect of good future news**, such as future growth or the release of a positive drug trial, for example. As the price rises, more and more people get excited. More people also start to feel they are missing out, and they don't want to miss out anymore, so they buy. The higher the price goes, the number of people lured in to buy increases, and thus the higher the price and volume go."     "Early on, blow-off tops may appear similar to strong rallies. A strong rally may rise at a 45-degree angle, but in a blow-off situation, the angle of ascent is almost vertical."     "Blow-off tops are massive‚Äînear vertical‚Äîrallies with no substantial pullbacks. This differentiates them from securities that are simply in a strong uptrend. If pullbacks do occur, they are typically only one to three days and then price rallies again."|2019-11-27 10:41:06

8wnbwe|e2elao|e2elao|1|So, my theory with fossil fuels or anything really where there is already abundance and infrastructure in place to use it but we have found better alternatives, is that as long as it's available (in the ground) then it will be capitalized upon.. can anyone think of a commodity that was free cash for many many years and is still in abundance but for which we have found better alternatives and essentially the market became no longer worth anything because of this? Simple theory that the fossil fuel industry will not die as long as the product and infrastructure exists to sell it.. basically my thesis is that there has to be a resurgence in the use of fossil fuels to the point that demand drives prices to unreasonable levels at which point alternatives will become more attractive. Even if 2008 prices was already that peak (even though the move was artificially driven, and not demand related), i predict resurgence in fossil fuels somehow.. don't know how.|2019-11-27 16:47:36

If you agree, keep reading otherwise stop here and move on.   That said, the risks of a downturn are larger now than say 3 years after the bull market officially started.  In that case, short vol positions are technically riskier now than before.  Based on the law of risk and return, short vol should see larger returns now vs previous.
