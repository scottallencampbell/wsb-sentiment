Like SPX is at 4,439.00 at the time of writing this and /ES is trading at 4432.00 so that means SPX and SPY will dip in the future.   Time for me to buy puts! üß∏|2022-04-13 12:19:25

Stimulated but calm mind, cold and calculated when needed, and never getting tired.

How do you think it would fit for me, based on my situation?  * I'm in the US. * I plan to trade at most one a year. * I plan to buy risky stocks and hold for a long time (I'm willing and able to lose 100% of the money I invest). * I want to maximize flexibility when it comes to the type of stock I can buy (different countries, different exchanges, different regulatory situations, whatever). * Because I don't plan to trade often, I don't care very much about the trading interface, trading hours, and stuff like that. * I don't care about trading on margin or trading in derivatives; I don't really even care that much about trading any assets other than stocks. * I am fairly paranoid about the idea of my broker screwing me, or getting hacked, or facing some regulatory issues that mess me up, or something like that, so institutional reputation and stability are important to me.  So basically my priorities are #1 variety, #2 reputation, #3 low per-transaction cost for large transactions. (But maybe I should have other priorities that I haven't thought of--let me know.)|2022-04-13 12:24:16

4l04ld|u2mtev|u2mtev|0|"   In our thematic email (premium subs only, here) we outlined the arguments why a bounce could be in the making in equities. The intraday reversal from highs yesterday actually makes the set up even more interesting. NASDAQ has huge supports in the 13800-14000 area. Note the inverted hammer candle yesterday. The psychology of this candle is basically telling shorts to be wary of the upside. The up candle today could be the confirmation for the short term bounce to kick in more violently."|2022-04-13 11:25:10
