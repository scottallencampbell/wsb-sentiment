The shorts attacked it numerous times, couldn't drop it below $10 after the first dip, and a 200k share buy order came across for $10.10.  The company maintains something in the neighborhood of a 1/3 short interest.  As the CEO warned last month, that's really freaking risky.     Every day brings it once again closer to exploding in price.  Today was a big milestone - blowing out everyone who shorted under $10 because it gapped up this morning and didn't fully retrace.|2020-09-28 13:48:54

6z2uxs|j19eqe|j19eqe|9|Not really sure what the bulls' plan is right now.  The last couple of days are either:  1) A legitimate reversal  Or  2) A short squeeze   Or more likely, some combo of the two (short squeeze that snowballed into fomo).    But, assuming it is an actual reversal, where are we going? There's literally no chance tech goes back to that absolute euphoria ATH when softbank was fucking with everything. So, the upside is pretty narrow. Maybe 5% on the indexes, or so.   Even if this is a reversal, we're just gonna end up being range-bound and bouncing around a 10-point range for the foreseeable future. It would've been better for bulls and bears if we dropped way further, so we could actually rally again.  Either way, bulls are basically gambling that this is a reversal for a theoretical 5% upside, at the risk of the bottom falling out again. Doesn't seem like the best time to go hyper bull.|2020-09-28 12:43:32

6zzaqu|j19eqe|j19eqe|7|Made some pretty big plays today with my $20 portfolio boys. Completely new to trading and thought I would just toss $20 into the blender and see what happens.  Started the day off with buying a share of SPI right off the bat because they were big good, right? Watched my portfolio go up by $0.14. Big gainz already, I'm liking it. Share price almost immediately dropped -0.84. Wait, that's not good. SPI said fuck you, that's nothing, and dropped even further by a whole $1.31. Now I'm big sad, might as well pull off one more infinite IQ play and pull out before it gets worse. Stonks proceed to rise back again to +1.96 more than their starting value.  So at the end of the day, my hefty $20 portfolio lost $1.31 and missed out on a $1.96 profit. This shits easy, idk what you guys are talking about.|2020-09-28 16:53:03

6ye5hb|j19eqe|j19eqe|7|Not a wallstreet guy. My background is 4-H and livestock, but I been trying to learn about stock to connect with my grandson (he's not technically a relation, being that he's my daughter-in-law's kid with her boyfriend) and I noticed that stocks seem to pause before crossing opening line (see NVDA this morning). It makes me wonder if the line was removed (or made invisible somehow)  if there'd be more movement in the market. My background is in livestock, mostly cattle--the wife dabbles in emus. Animals are very cautious about crossing boundaries-- we had a couple longhorns wander off and we caught them after they wandered into the PigglyWiggly parking lot. Anyway, good luck with your calls (or your puts, I suppose, if that's your inclination).|2020-09-28 09:37:41

6yrxnk|j19eqe|j19eqe|3|I'm sorry I know this question gets asked a lot. I've already used the search bar, google, and YouTube. I'm 99% confident in what I'm about to do, but I just need that final reassurance that I 100% understand my risk. So far I've only bought options for the past month and I'm ready to make the next step. So below I've written out my understanding in full of debit, credit, and condors and would hugly appreciate someone checking my work.  So as long as I BUY the opposite of what I sell, I'll never be on the hook to purchase 100 shares. I'll only lose the difference in premium. Correct?  So for a debit spread, I would lose at maximum the premium paid no matter what. That would be to buy a call at X strike and sell a call at X + Y strike. This gains money as it approaches the strikes, loses money as it goes further away, and maxes profit at or above the sell call strike.  For a credit spread I would lose at maximum the difference between my strikes, no matter what. That would be to buy a put at X and sell a put at X + Y. Profit here works just like a debit but inverted.  For an Iron condor I would lose at maximum the premium I paid. That would be to sell a call at X and buy at X + Y, and sell a put at below the underlying and by a put below the sold put. This makes profit as time goes on and the underlying stays in between the two legs of the condor.   At anytime before expiration, I can get out of my spread or condor. This would be by selling to close a debit spread, buying to close a credit spread, and selling to close a iron condor.  If I hold to experation, or get assigned at any point, robinhood should exercise the other leg of the contract and I'll be left with just whatever I lost or profited on the premium. I may see a huge positive or negative buying power for a short time, which will be resolved shortly.   It is wise to close and spread or condor near close the day before experation, provided I have held them to that point.|2020-09-28 11:24:35

Tesla's stock has already risen over 400% this year, but CEO Elon Musk said he thinks the company "will be worth more in 5 years" in an interview with Kara Swisher¬†for a New York Times podcast. "Some critical mass of the market has concluded that Tesla will win, I guess," said Musk on the stock's increases. "I've gone on record already saying the stock prices have been high, and that was well before the current level. But also if you ask me, do I think if Tesla will be worth more than this in 5 years? I think the answer is yes."|2020-09-28 13:33:09

6yq25s|j19eqe|j19eqe|3|Gotta love it:  On March 26, 2018, Mr. Bowes (Trump‚Äôs nominee for head of CFTC) bought 15,500 shares of Genworth Financial, a Richmond, Va.-based insurance company with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion. The stock closed that session at $2.88 a share, making Mr. Bowes‚Äôs investment worth about $45,000.  The following day, Genworth and Beijing-based financial-holding company China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co. agreed to extend a merger deal that was pending before a U.S. government panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews foreign investments.  On June 11, the first trading day after Cfius approved the merger, Genworth‚Äôs shares jumped 27% to $4.82. Mr. Bowes sold his shares on Nov. 8, when Genworth‚Äôs stock closed at $4.71, increasing the value of this stake by almost $30,000.  In a written response to questions about the trades, Mr. Bowes said he had no inside or advance information, and no knowledge of Cfius‚Äôs deliberations. He also disputed the notion that the bet was well-timed, without providing further details.|2020-09-28 11:10:45

6y9hqu|j19eqe|j19eqe|2|Many traders and hedge funds are turning bearish.  Lots of reports that people are hedging or have outright shorted the market.  This change has continued after the 10% pullback that we had.  I believe that the stimulus is coming. Either it will come before the election or after but it is coming.  The market will see that as positive with more money in the economy to spend.  I believe that infection rates are flattening and will continue to slow.  The country and the world will continue to reopen which is a steady stream of positive news.  I believe the most important indicator is earnings which are upon us.  Many companies are going to report good numbers (similar to what we have seen).  Companies have reduced expenses, refinanced debt, bought back stock, etc.    The VIX not falling below 25 is troubling but I still believe that we are headed higher into year-end.  I bought the dip so the past two days have been great.  I am going to hold into the end of the year pairing back some names to get back to my core positions and raise some cash into next year.|2020-09-28 08:53:34

6zaxus|j19eqe|j19eqe|1|hey if any of u guys out there arent 100% retarded or have been hurt enough in the past month, stock suggestion is SABR to play airlines. Icy airplane software company that has pretty big upside. Ever since the airline rout, sabr has been 1/3 its original price, down near 6-8 dollars. It always trades within this range and has limited downward risk given its already near bottom and company has massive balance sheet to survive a multi year recession in airlines industry. Sabr was below 6 all last week, and that is truly free money. Sabr below 7 is free money. When airlines go on their occasional rip, sabr shoots up fat. So in short, if u play the cheap 6 dollar stock instead of options, you can legit get 10-15% of ur investment within 1-2 months NO CAP|2020-09-28 13:41:58

I got into Tesla Post split @ 483, sold on the way down around 460ish, and am now back in at around 420.  Why would the best choice have been to waste time/money by letting that tick down on its own and also rack unrealized losses for no reason? Something about some theory about the need to time the bottom? Who cares if I missed a 4% move up... it would have been in the red for me anyway.|2020-09-28 07:36:35
