iaujts|krlpdb|krlpdb|16|Guys, the biggest reason to be bullish here: Expect further stimulus from Democrats (The $2000 checks and at least 2 reconciliation bills that spend around $1-2 trillion should pass the next 2 years).  And equally important, Americans have made huge strides in reducing short-term debt over the past 6-8 months.  I believe Americans have the cleanest balance sheets as a collective whole that we've had in a while.  A lot of people using money saved from not going out to restaurants/movies/vacations/etc. to pay down CC/short-term/revolving debt.  This sets up for a 2nd half 2021-into 2022 boom once we get to 150-200 million people vaccinated.  You will have Americans with clean balance sheets ready to spend and tons of stimulus (extra money for green energy/infrastructure) also on the way.

Elon overtook Jeff Bezos to become the richest man on earth last night It makes sense to me now why Apple rumored their electric car intentions again in Dec (after a clear Biden win). They wanted to capitalize on this new Democratic wave of renewable energy, something that didnt happen 4 years ago when they were working on their car project.

The implications of dem senate control means no more blocked attempts to change regulation. mitch has been denying every single house bill with cannabis reform in it.  This year MSOs will likely be able to get off the Canadian securities exchange and on to the nyse.  TLRY with their merger combined with sooner than later entry in to the US means that a big player like AB/InBev will be throwing several billion at them just like STZ did with CGC. It wont fully get priced in until something actually happens, but should be expected to raise the price significantly in anticipation.  Cannabis is going to save the economy.

I'll wait and hold my shares tight tho and eat any pullback in those while I wait for the reentry on Jan 22 calls. Anything to 40 looks like free money rn and we could just run into the presidency as banks regear into the new green economy. But like I said the 10 bagger was begging me to take it and throw it at SPAC warrants.

By law, the financial institution must return the payment to the IRS; they cannot hold and issue the payment to an individual when the account is no longer active. If Get My Payment shows “Payment Status #2 – Not Available” you will not receive a second EIP.     The IRS advises people that if they don’t receive their Economic Impact Payment, they should file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible.|2021-01-06 11:52:16

ias1du|krlpdb|krlpdb|19|All you fucking retards need to understand something. The market is like a bunch of children that react to anything that challenges the status quo with knee jerk. Democrats winning in Georgia will cause probably cause a sell-off or massive rotation because for the last four years we've had a Cheeto puff child giving tax breaks to every company and fucking over the poor. His indecisive and overblown behavior trickles downward and causes the same type of behavior in the market. Pair that with one of the greatest biological threats in the last hundred years, rough international tension between many superpowers, and a new civil Rights movement gaining significant ground in the US. As long as things happen relatively slowly there's not much change in the market except for rotations or minor dips. If something drastic happens, such as Congress being flipped to one party majority, that'll do it.   I don't give a shit about Republicans or Ddemocrats. They're both fucking boring. Total snoozefest. So don't sit here and try to write a massive article on why Republicans or democrats are your fleshlights to me. I don't care.  For you new investors, riding meme stocks or shit that you read DD on here at 1:00 a.m. two or three days ago, be aware that today may be turbulent. Possibly till end of January. But if you're not a fucking retard who buys weeklies or dailies and you plan accordingly, you will be fine as long as you're not buying 200% out of the money calls or puts for every play.  it doesn't matter if you are Republican or Democrat. The market will take your money. Pay Attention to the direction of sentiment.  TL:DR -> Stop buying stupid fucking weeklies and only buy EV, Tech, and Renewable long term.|2021-01-06 07:03:27

ibitt8|krlpdb|krlpdb|5|It’s been about a year since I opened my Robinhood account. It is time to close it. I withdrew my remaining ~$35 today.  I lost about $750 on Robinhood this year. So percentage wise I am in good company with the rest of you autists.   I used Robinhood solely for trading options. Sort of a learning experience. My conclusion is that options trading is not compatible with the level of effort I am willing to put in. I really just don’t have the time to watch RH all day to execute trades. I would leave the account open to continue mobile gambling, except I am required to close it due to work.  My big idea opening a RH account was to buy options on companies that run funeral businesses. That turned out to be a wash.

The two together also mean countries that have made it illegal just to stay in the good graces of the U.S. might start flipping to legal weed all over the world.

I’m still all in however once the NASDAQ touches 13K I’m trading my CALLS 4 PUTS.  (Yesterday the NASDAQ touched 12,840 meaning we’re just 160 points away and futures are up.    WHY?   So for in 2020 every time the NASDAQ touches a new 1K milestone; 10K, 11K, 12K etc it has corrected 3-5% within the next couple of days (it may close over that marker and even go up more for a day there after however then gravity hits)   -9K; May 8th: went over 9K (fell for the next 3 days approx 3.5% and took 5 trading days to get back on track).   -10K; June 10th: touched 10K (June 11th fell over 5% and took over 7 trading days to touch 10K once again. Then for the next month traded sideways high 9K low 10K   -11K; Aug 8th touched 11K and the following 3 days went down (over 3%)   -12K; Sep 2nd; touched 12K following 3 days down over 12% didn’t touch 12K again until Nov. 24th   Don’t be a tard and cash some of your profits.

ibjvpu|krlpdb|krlpdb|2|WMT's in a weird spot heading into the next congress.   A) Federal "living wage" legislation is all but certain, so their wages OPEX increases. Bearish.  B) Most of their customers are going to be spending that money at WMT anyways though. Revenue increases. Bullish.   C) Their push into prime membership style model is supported by covid stuff and stickiness of American laziness. Revenue increases. Bullish.  D) But their shit is still coming from China, and I expect Biden's china team to actually be pretty fierce on China and their never ending stream of bullshit low quality products. Higher costs of good sold, lower gross profit, bearish.   [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/10/biden-to-name-katherine-tai-us-trade-representative.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/10/biden-to-name-katherine-tai-us-trade-representative.html)  E) Target milfs recruiting new members. Bearish.   F) Still focused on low margin retail, no cash generator like AMZN's cloud services to serve as loss leader. Bearish.   G) Inflationary pressure will probably become real soon. Bullish on revenue, Bearish on costs.   net / net, WMT has very limited upside from here, IMO.   thots?|2021-01-06 11:05:38

ib8dnk|krlpdb|krlpdb|1|an issue I have with ENPH is that while their microinverters appear to be applicable to both solar & wind, I believe the emphasis is on small scale, home-based generation, and not the large-scale setups. That's an assumption, I don't know for sure.  My hunch is that any Dem green energy package will more than likely support large scale projects over home-based subsidies, because of a) the efficiency concerns, b) execution concerns (does gov trust the people to self-convert? especially when homeowner has some out of pocket?), and c) inclination to support large construction contracting / jobs.  thots?|2021-01-06 09:37:23

ibzff2|krlpdb|krlpdb|1|Someone help me understand something basic. A stock price is at 12.53, and the 12 calls cost 0.55 while the 12.50 calls cost 0.16. So the 12.50c has .03 intrinsic value, but .13 extrinsic value. While the 12 calls have 0.53 intrinsic value, but only 0.02 extrinsic value.   They have the same exposure to the upside, while the 12.50 has far more risk of expiring totally worthless, while the 12 is very likely to retain at least some intrinsic value.   Why is this? Isn't the 12 undervalued? It should have all the extrinsic value of the 12.50, with some value added from lower downside. Is it simply undervalued right now?|2021-01-06 12:59:31

Let’s say I have $40k in shares and the stock begins mooning from $20 to $40 to $60 etc.   Obviously I want to ride the squeeze as much as possible. That being said.  Is it possible to set sell parameters at 30, 40, 50, 60 only if the stock passes that point and begins to drop down?   This is assuming the stock jumps up to one of those points and then begins to fall and hit the point again.   So if the stock had the squeeze and jumped up to 60 then 65. Then back to 60 will robinhood execute my sell share?|2021-01-06 13:09:04

ic1u1d|krlpdb|krlpdb|1|How to make money:   Sell vol through butterflies on IV spikes, go for monthlies where the liquidity is high. Model potential butterflies in an Excel sheet and look for relatively cheap / mispriced ones. Generally don't go beyond whatever SD-move the straddle is pricing on OTM flies.   Cover at around 20-30% profits. If underlier goes beyond your far wing, consider taking the loss and moving on. Use 231/132s if it fits your risk profile. Try targetting a price on the underlier as well, aim for pinning the fly at expiry. Nothing more profitable than that.|2021-01-06 13:17:31

ibm7wg|krlpdb|krlpdb|1|Thinking about loading up on NVDA puts.  3000 series is in short supply, they just cant get out enough. Yes, demand is high too, but supply is the main constraint.  MSRPs is lower than 2000 series (aside from 3090 vs 2080Ti) while the BOM is higher (larger dies, GDDR6X memory, expensive cooling solutions) and for the first time in about 5 years AMD is able to compete in the high-end market.

ib4cq3|krlpdb|krlpdb|-1|Enphase - Best solar stock to invest in 2021  Solar power, though around for decades, has seen a renewed interest recently. A push for cleaner energy sources, combined with improving economics for solar thanks to cost reductions, is mainly behind the growing enthusiasm. Several solar stocks soared to new highs in 2020, reflecting investors' positive sentiment for the sector. One such company is Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), whose strong performance during the year sent its stock surging a massive 554% in 2020 as of this writing. But do the company's fundamentals support the stock's steep rise? Let's find out.  Strong operational performance Enphase Energy has come a long way since 2016 when the company faced a cash crunch and struggled to generate profits. Over the years, Enphase has surely turned itself around by reducing costs while growing revenues. In the latest quarter, the company generated $39.4 million in net income. Its revenue growth in the last couple of years has exceeded that of its close rival SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG).  ENPH Revenue (Quarterly) Chart  ENPH REVENUE (QUARTERLY) DATA BY YCHARTS  Similarly, Enphase's gross margin growth is also noteworthy. The company has consistently improved its gross margin, which stood at 53.2% in the latest quarter. Excluding a one-time refund on tariffs, the gross margin was still a healthy 41%. Enphase Energy's gross margins surged past SolarEdge's margins in 2019.|2021-01-06 09:03:48
