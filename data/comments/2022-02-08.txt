tlcgex|ml86d3|ml86d3|9|After spending 2 weeks doing a DD on PLTR.  In it's purest form PLTR is very well made **data aggregation** platform. Forget all the AI bullshit, those people have no idea wtf are they talking about. Because those AI modules are build on top of the core platform kind of similar to plugin or extension.  Now I do believe that PLTR is the new Boeing. If you think for a second the current warfare is mostly digital and information. A good analyst/hacker with a laptop is more powerful than any battleship these days (those are just for shows). In the next 5 years, PLTR will be too important to fail for the US government just like BA before. It's very obvious lmao and I think Cathie sees it too.|2021-04-06 12:35:02

tkht78|ml86d3|ml86d3|7|So VIAC has been floundering because of forced liquidations from big banks. CS last night offered a huge block and updated investors on their loss, so people are speculating that they finally have unloaded most/all their VIAC risk.  üì∑üì∑  I'm not a huge fan of VIAC, but without a doubt they are a very profitable company. Their current market cap is equivalent to their revenue. Their forward P/E is less than 10. By all common valuation metrics, they are very cheap. The ONLY REASON the stock price is so low is because of absolutely massive liquidations. That is it. We may never see a stock have this much stock liquidated in decades.  VIAC is incredibly cheap. Hop on board while it's still cheap. Easily could go back to 100 in the next month.  VIAC April 16 $45|2021-04-06 08:47:56

tl2l0t|ml86d3|ml86d3|3|PTON quick short DD. From June 30 2020 three months end to Sep 30 2020 three months end, total workouts competed was essentially flat. Flat growth likely due to people going outside and covid deceleration. However, nice 26% growth in total workouts for dec 30 2021 three months end. Will also see baller growth for Mar 30 2021 three months end due to New Years resolutions and stuff like that.   However, market is forward looking. I think guidance for Jun 30 three months end is going to be WEAK due to decreasing covid, people going outside, etc.. of course subs and all that are important, but engagement in the form of workouts completed is more important, imo. If engagement falls, which I think it will, then it‚Äôll lead to lower subs. Guess we will see.   PTON 09/21 70p|2021-04-06 11:23:47

tjzqrm|ml86d3|ml86d3|8|Stock futures are down a bit, a day after the Dow and S&P finished at record highs. As of 0615, small caps are seeing most of the selling, with the Russell 2000 down 0.6%. S&P and Nasdaq are off about 0.2%. Dow Industrials down about 0.1%. Bonds are seeing some bids, with the 10-year yield back down to 1.7%. This even though markets in Europe are higher at mid-day.  Probably just the market taking a breath. There isn‚Äôt much on the economic or earnings calendars today. All things being equal, with all the money sloshing around the system there‚Äôs a good reason to suspect it will find its way back into stocks before too long.

Romeo finally getting some love, but only on the release of their relatively small order with Kenworth.   With this said, imagine the run FISKER FSR will have once more concrete news is shared regarding orders, manufacturing, Foxconn details, etc etc.  But seems like news that provokes revenue, like the Romeo / Kenworth news, is what will drive its share price.  All I do is buy more and more Fisker FSR to bring my cost basis down further.

And I can look at the price occasionally to see whether the price is outlandishly cheap or outlandishly high, but prices don't tell me anything about a business. Business figures themselves tell me something about a business, but the price of a stock doesn't tell me anything about a business. I would rather value a business first, and not even know the price so that I'm not influenced by the price in establishing my valuation, and then look at the price later to see if it's way out of line with where my value is."  "You're not right or wrong because 1000 people agree with you, and you're not right or wrong because 1000 people disagree with you - you're right because your facts and reasoning are right."  "If I were to be asked to participate in a business opportunity, would it make any difference whether I bought it on a Tuesday or a Saturday or an election year? It's not what a businessman thinks about when buying a business. So why think about it when buying stocks, because stocks are just pieces of businesses."|2021-04-06 05:53:01

tlpuah|ml86d3|ml86d3|0|**Question: how to create a GTC sell order for a high price (ex: $50k)?**  Currently I have some stock in Ally, TD Ameritrade, and cashapp.  When I try to place a GTC sell limit order at a price that is significantly higher than current market price (on Ally or TD Amertirade), then i cannot perform that action. I called Ally up to place the order through a broker and they told me the same thing. The price has to be "reasonable" but could not provide me with a definition of what is "reasonable". I have some GME stock and was thinking of putting that type of order for some of my shares at a pretty high price, just in case the squeeze happens when i'm afk.  \- What are the rules around this?  \- Do some brokers allow you to place these ridiculous sell orders?  \- Should I just wait until the squeeze?  \- Should i move to a different broker?  Cashapp doesn't even let me set a sell price as far as I can tell, so not a big fan of that...  EDIT: I am afraid that either I will be too late to sell and miss the peak(ish) range, or that even when i place an order during the squeeze, it won't be executed in a timely manner because of the high volume of other orders happening around the same time|2021-04-06 14:13:11
