w3ky4v|snhjn6|snhjn6|6|PTON... not sure how to play this pump, so just sharing what I am doing. With the announcement of layoffs a new CEO, and news someone may acquire them; the pump today is expected as that is usually bullish. So, I bought 10 shares PM for fun @$28.95. I have a stop limit now at $34 incase it goes down. I expect it to go down and will enter this as a limit order for AH if it doesn't hit that mark first.  Since I expect it to go down, I picked up a 2/11P @ $35  if the Put fails, I have some hedge with he shares to ease the loss a bit, but I expect the price to drop to the mid to low $20s which should play out nicely.  The company was mismanaged and mistakes were made. I think they will be in for many quarters of pain, the pump is fake... but too much bad news on one side and too much bullish news on the other side to commit big money.|2022-02-08 10:30:46

w3ntqi|snhjn6|snhjn6|5|"Central bank attitudes to inflation are complex. Having spent much of the past two decades avoiding deflation, toleration for inflation may be greater than publicly expressed. Rising prices would help increase consumption, as buyers accelerate purchases out of fear of ever-higher costs. Higher inflation is also key to dealing with the high levels of debt over the long-term. It would increase taxes and business revenues and reduce purchasing power, which lowers real debt levels."  This just shows you how utterly retarded economists are.  No one consumes more shit because it may costs more. It already costs more so people will spend less.  I sure as shit don't go out and buy more clothes while my grocery store bills keep burning a hole in my wallet because I think t-shirt prices may go up.

w2kd7j|snhjn6|snhjn6|3|Lyft. Google trend for Q4 was up 30%. Other related stocks such as restaurants and cinemas had a great quarter, despite the pandemic which had a peak in the last month of Q3. Institutional holders increased (more than 80% of them) their positions on 12/31/2021 ($42). And it is trading at a huge discount.   Not planning on holding it for long. Many Lyft drivers complain about the massive demand decrease in January. Also insider trading is not looking promising.

w34d8w|snhjn6|snhjn6|3|PTON bag holders are high on hopium if they think they're gonna sell the company.  The founder owns 40% if the shares.  The founder plus the board own 83% of the shares.  It'll be a tremendous blow to the founder's ego to sell now at all time lows when the first challenge ever for the company comes up.  They probably think they'll leave billions of dollars on the table if they sell out now.  They will regroup and give it another crack to maximize their wealth by trying to dig out of the hole.  At this point, the company can't go a whole lot lower, so why sell now after all of the negative news is baked in?|2022-02-08 08:41:53

w30ys4|snhjn6|snhjn6|10|People complain all the time that the market is rigged but they still buy shit. Cough cough GME and AMC….  I own GME and it’s the single worst play I’ve made to date. It may squeeze or it may not, but what’s the point if you’re bleeding money for months on end. This has been the biggest bull run in the history of the earth and yet we’re loosing money.   I remember reading a comment on the daily ape subreddit thread 2 months ago. It said “I just DRS’d 10 shares, when the squeeze happens how do I sell.” Maybe I’m just underestimating the collective retard power at play here, but Jesus Christ what a statement.|2022-02-08 08:16:58

If CPI comes in low, the market will moon even harder.  The CPI will have to come in smoking hot to threaten a 3/4 point rate hike to move this market down. The only thing that will tank this market is some unexpected shock regarding the balance sheet.  That's the one thing no one can predict.  This whole market sucks.

Will I learn my lesson ? probably not.   &#x200B;  I'll keep watching it & look to open new puts if it can close below 100 for a few days.

w450rl|snhjn6|snhjn6|1|# Dear whoever needs to hear this: you are not in the middle of "the crash."  Selling has been highly controlled since november/december. Just trade what is in front of you. you're more likely to lose a fuck ton of money holding over night than you are just scalping opportunities. When we sustain at a low or a high, ask yourself this question "given the nearest expiration date, what would fuck the most amount of people if it were to happen right now" and that's where we go next until there is **certainty.**  &#x200B;  edit: just sustained at 449. bulls with paper hands sold. now we can go for 453. we wont make a reversal until after 3pm tomorrow for max pain/sweeps.|2022-02-08 12:31:33

w474ja|snhjn6|snhjn6|-1|If you are depressed cuz of losses and are just staying in the game because you want to make it back, and then some, remember this is a zero-sum game. There will be a loser somewhere. If you think you can do this for a living, remember nothing of value is created here. Nothing. Don't give me the bullshit about capital allocation, only a fraction of the money shuffled here ends up in the hands of firms. You are simply extracting value. Chances are you can make more money doing something productive for society instead of shuffling paper around.  This is a cope for people who have lost, but that doesn't make it less true.|2022-02-08 12:44:15
