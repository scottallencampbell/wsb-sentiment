ul43ch|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|48| To all of you bulls out there, please be careful today. Don't buy short dates or far OOTM strikes.  Sell your calls on open (if we stay elevated like this) and wait an hour to see which way things are going to go. Who cares if you miss 50 bps or even 1% in the grand scheme of things? The flip side is that you could be quickly cleaned out of your 6/19 calls on a 3% drop.  Yesterday was so damn ugly there will be residual fear and if there are some sellers, things could get red again fast.  I have nothing against you bulls and I want to help. I'm not saying go short. I'm not saying don't buy calls. I'm just saying don't buy dumb calls and maybe wait an hour to see if we are going to get raped again before you buy.  That is all.|2020-06-12 06:01:38

Though hurting, the economy is recovering.  New unemployment claims have declined for ten weeks in a row.   New business starts are up.   The rise in Covid-19 cases won‚Äôt shut down the nation, as happened in March.   Hospitals are ready; testing is massive; and this time states won‚Äôt put infected patients in nursing homes, as New York did, which tragically and unnecessarily killed thousands.

Last time the fed surprised markets, by dumping rates by 50 bps at the start of the covid, the market dumped 200 points, went up 80 points, and then dumped another 300 points. That was also a refute of the market optimism.   This time around, its the same thing, the fed is refuting the V shape recovery by keeping rates low for extended amount of time. Markets are finally reflecting a deep recession and second wave. We are going to dump to 2800 over the beginning of next week.   got 100k in puts 6/19.|2020-06-12 14:52:12

umek0m|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|4|Got to love it. I bought a handful of June 12 300 puts on Friday as a lotto/"hedge".  I guess I just had a hunch, and they were cheap, so I bought some and told myself I would let them become a hero or go to zero.  As of Wednesday's close, they were pretty much a total loss. Thursday morning rolls around, SPY dips to 310, and I'm giddy. I took my 20% profit (bought at .35, sold at .42) and thought I was the fucking second coming of Jesus Fucking Christ.  As of today, I'm sick to my fucking stomach. I haven't looked at the premiums since yesterday and I think if I did I would probably throw up. This one is going to sting for a long fucking time. I've been in this game long enough to know 1) options is a fools game and very, very few people win long term, and 2) the stars don't align very often and when they do you *better* capitalize on it because it's those opportunities that make people wildly rich.

uma8hn|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|9|I know you can‚Äôt time the markets I have something to say which is bothering me for a while.   ‚Ä¢ Dollar rate is near zero, which means fed have pretty much used all it‚Äôs arsenal. Unless we‚Äôre talking negative rates.   ‚Ä¢ Right now markets are higher on Liquidity and these near zero rates, Which means if massive drop comes then there‚Äôs nothing much fed can do.   ‚Ä¢ We are in a bubble created by past fed chairmans by reducing rates artificially driving prices up. Earnings are not longer that much relevance here. You are basically giving no option to funds / Institutions / People but to invest in markets to beat inflation. That this massive red flag in my books. But then again our last decade rally is based on this.   ‚Ä¢ Back to crash, If Biden wins in November (most likely if Reddit is to be believed), A democrat winning could create massive sell off wave in markets, there could be nothing fed could do.   ‚Ä¢ Markets can fall to that level where SP500 dividend could be 3% or higher.

umi2ku|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|13|For real though, there is going to be civil unrest if COVID cases spike and we do not shut down.   People will get pissed as fuck if they feel their lives are being put in danger for minimum wage.   I know this sub likes to either preach doom or say corona doesn‚Äôt exist, but the reality is that it‚Äôs a moderately severe disease that does have the potential to seriously incapacitate a healthy, young individual. In a rare circumstance that healthy, young individual could die.   Older people with pre-existing conditions are at risk, but not the only ones at risk.   Even disregarding personal safety for healthy people in the workforce, a large number of lower-paid workers live with parents or other older relatives.   I am personally not at a point where I am betting on another shutdown, but I will say that the current attitude people here have is shockingly similar to mid-late February. US Federal Government officials may say that it will not happen, but in reality that holds no water at this point in time. If cases spike enough, they will be forced to shut down.   I remain hopeful that this does not happen, but the realist in me sees this as inevitable.|2020-06-12 13:27:59

So if you see the market is in a downtrend then goes up into option expiry, you know the MM is going long, same thing in the opposite direction. The following couple of days will then be in the opposite direction as the MM unwind their position over the next few days.   Today, there was almost no support at 300 until MM started buying late into the trading day to ensure 305 max pain. Big dumps comes monday/tuesday.|2020-06-12 15:01:36

ulixd7|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|3|"Investors on Friday went right back into the plays whose fates hinge on a successful reopening of the economy. Carnival Corp jumped 11.1%. United Airlines climbed 11.2%. Other winners included brick-and-mortar retailers Kohl‚Äôs and Gap. Those stocks were hit big time during Thursday‚Äôs sell-off as investors feared the reopening of the economy could be delayed by a second wave of cases."  So basically, bearish investors yesterday were like "Oh shit virus stats getting bad again! We're gonna have to do more stay at home"  And the next day bullish investors were like "...Nuh uh! We WON'T have to shut down again. Because... we just won't okay?!"|2020-06-12 08:58:11

Maybe we go up for another few months in the meantime  Would a 6 month ATM spy straddle be a safe way to trade with the uncertainty? Is that long enough? Just one option each way is a total of 6k for both. thats 1/3 of my portfolio, which seems like a lot to me.  Should I just get 2 shorter calls and 1 6 month put instead?|2020-06-12 12:36:06

I bought vixx and the other derivative that scales with vix and I literally didn‚Äôt understand how I was safe from the calls being otm this am. So I sold and they ended up being 3k by 1pm lol. Shit like that. But I feel like I got my first wake up call. Ready for the following weeks/months. This sub is nice. I‚Äôm drunk after today. Oh yeah, have a good weekend everyone.|2020-06-12 17:21:32

uldzsx|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|2|Wish I had gone more long at the end of day yesterday but was worried I had missed some big news which caused us to tank.  Nope, turns out it was a bunch of usual wall of worry stuff, more covid cases, Congress not meeting until next month on next stimulus, unemployment still bad etc...  Looks like it was just profit taking plus some minor bad news (yes, no one on wall street gives a shit about Covid) that likely started a waterfall of margin calls which led to the most orderly market drop I have seen in a while.  Lot of, if not bargains, at least companies at very fair prices given ZIRP for years in the future.    Hope there's more profit taking / fear today so I can get in at a better spot but we will likely bounce hard this morning and keep climbing since every Monday is blood green after folks have had the weekend to digest everything.|2020-06-12 08:08:24

Since options don't just vanish again, is it only because a number of options moving out of the expiry time window and expire in 26 days or less?  Can you compensate a VIX gain from puts with more calls? I can't imagine. Or by buying either puts or calls with a strike closer to the current value of SPX? This could in theory predict a smaller future change without taking old options out of the equation.|2020-06-12 08:09:42

I live in Georgia, by the way.  Most people here don't give a shit about Covid.    I don't own any DNKN shares or options.  But seriously thought about loading up on calls.

Plus, I‚Äôve tried the Beyond Burger and didn‚Äôt love it, but I would absolutely try some of the meals they show in the presentation and I like the greater variety in product offering.

Most companies will not do share buy backs. So 90% of the bull run in past years was share buy backs. So I expect a choppy market for 2 years at least.   So I wouldn't place my bets on leaps as guaranteed.   3) best thing is to own stonks that give good dividend and grow.

Unemployment is going to slowly to improve from here and there will be another stimulus. There were some jitters over the media scare on a second wave but the reality is that some places haven't had a first wave. There are going to continue to be localized outbreaks and people will learn to live with it.    The drop to 220 was a liquidity crisis, that is not remotely an issue anymore with the Fed stepping in. Some airlines and some retail are solvency risks but their stock prices mostly reflect it.

If there is a vaccine in 2022, it won't be properly tested for a long term side effects, therefore too risky to even bother, unless you're literally dying of Covid.  4. If we have a second wave, we need to consider the situation where we're not forcing another lockdown, just so the economy doesn't crumble into a total depression and our Western companies are not mass bought out by the Chinese.  5.

Robinhood level intellect retail investors expecting green everyday, can't handle one red chart, sell off long positions without holding and believing "news" from motley fool and seeking lopha.  Oh no the other leg is down, everything is crashing, its march all over again, I lost my life savings, da second wave is coming, PANIC!! PANIC!!  I got attacked left and right in my Mall DD threads by idiots that didnt realize the whole market was down and exiting. Good bye.  Honestly im glad these low intellect retail investors are gone, makes the market more consistent relatively speaking and only leaves the serious people.  Robinhood and other friends have been around for awhile but their recent marketing campaigns were lying and dumbing down the markets and how they worked massively, is arguably borderline criminal as it has brought in the dumbest mother fuckers. You know Sec is waiting to add more regulations at us to prevent us from taking advantage of the market and these people will cause it.  People were literally saying lockdown 2 was going to happen and people were no longer going outside. Lol  Oops, sorry, the reopening is still continuing despite an artificial market drop. You fall for the fake news saying the drop was from the Fed's "gloomy" report when they basically confirmed that they aren't cutting support until at least 2022 and they expected unemployment to drop, AND said they see a GDP rebound by next year. Maybe earlier.  Lol but please leave, it makes the market more consistent and manageable and we don't have emotional panic investors messing with prices.   Idiots lol.|2020-06-12 08:19:41

Hair stylists have 3 week waiting lists. iPhones and MacBooks still 4 week back logs. Poor souls, always hoping for negative stuff to happen, eats away at their mental.

um2wvd|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|-2|FMCI DD  Alright fellas, I'm the autist that brought you the original DD on FMCI and gave my thoughts on what company they would be merging with. Obviously I wasn't even fucking close because I've never even heard of Tattooed Chef. So I did a little research and have come to a fair conclusion. This whole time we were hoping for something like Impossible or JUST to COMPETE with Beyond. Instead, this company will be a complement to Beyond.  Tattooed Chef meals are currently sold at Walmart, Sams, Costco, Whole Foods, Target, and many more common stores. Meat prices are currently around $6 a lb in the US (which is the highest its ever been by a fair margin) so vegetarian foods are great options for many people. I'm a huge carnivore so if any vegetarians could comment on how their food actually tastes I would appreciate. They do have a 4.8/5 stars rating on Facebook so that is a good sign.  Let's compare Tattoed Chef's and BYND real quick. Tattoed Chef estimated revenue for this year is about $150 million, and is projected to increase to $222 million in 2021. Beyond, which has been a $100 plus stock for awhile now, expects around $450 million in revenue for this year. In comparison that would make FMCI at least a $40-50 stock by year's end. They also did 6-7x as much revenue as JUST, the company many people wanted it to be. This is a very much high-growth company and business they are in. It's fair to assume the stock tanked today due to people's disappointment in it not being a different, more well known company. My price target is $30-$35 around merger date and $50-60 by the end of the year. No matter what having a second plant based food company on the public market should help both stocks.  If you don't have faith I can understand that. Like I said previously, do what you want with this information.  I bought the fuckin dip.  700 shares at 11.78.  2500 warrants at 1.67  (wouldn't let me post on the main page for some reason)|2020-06-12 11:33:10

umaul4|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|-2|Okay... I'm going to go on a rant and tell you why stocks only go up...  CEO and board members compensation is based on how high a stock will go. So every company's main directive is to increase share price. 90+% of what a company makes goes towards buybacks or dividends on average, a company's role in today's economy is to grow share price - nothing else. If your compensation structure is based in a manner where growing shareprice is how the leaders of the company get paid; then that's what the company is going to do above all else.   Politicians have realized that first and foremost people look at the stock market to indicate whether the economy is doing well or not; they don't look at wealth disparity, consumer purchasing trends.  So for everyone thinking that the economy plays a factor in the stock market; stop. Eventually, yes, it matters.... but the shape of the economy has to actually hurt earnings and companies have to start going out of business before it matters.  So it's mattered so far for: airlines, hotels and hertz... it will matter eventually.   But every time you go short you're betting against the CEO of that company and you're betting against the entire power of the US to manipulate stock prices... if you time that bet correctly you'll make a ton of money, but it's an uphill battle.  end rant.|2020-06-12 12:31:23

Viruses always get stronger through the years mutating alongside hosts. The common flu doesn‚Äôt even have as high a mutation rate as covid and yet we have new variants every season.  Would be ignorant to think it‚Äôll disappear. All that matters is if we can produce enough supply for the demand in restarting an economy quickly and efficiently.

ul7djs|h7i2lz|h7i2lz|-8|So I‚Äôve been having this story play out in my dreams the past 3 weeks. New dream. Takes place at a university. Fringe type groups of quite attractive people all wide eyed, some that is. It‚Äôs this weird Japanese death vampire cult but they are not Japanese (new info last night, when they said I need to turn my power over to Japan after being bit). If you let them lure you in and suck your blood you need to continue feeding 8 times a day for the rest of your life (also new info I was told after bit). This is where the dread finally comes in and you start thinking through your options. I ran across a couple groups that didn‚Äôt want to feed and essentially kill innocent people, they were growing white hair, had crazy pearlized iris. Fading into death.   Weeks prior I heard about stories around campus of these people and sometimes got that gut wrenching feeling. For instance super smart dude I met in the computer lab was one of these guys. They aren‚Äôt normally distinguishable outside the aura you feel. Last night was terrible as I juggled my options of who I‚Äôd even be willing to subjugate to this existence.   Sorry for the non stock market stuff. Nobody to share with. It‚Äôs all so vivid even weeks later. What happens when you quit smoking wax after a decade of daily use lol.|2020-06-12 06:48:49

A lot of this profit is from a put on TQQQ. I was wondering if y‚Äôall think I should sell right when the market opens. I don‚Äôt know if TQQQ will continue going down. I hope it does lol. My strike is $70 and the contract expires 6/26.|2020-06-12 06:25:56
