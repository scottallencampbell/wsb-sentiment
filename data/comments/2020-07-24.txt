z4jj68|hwz949|hwz949|17|Theta Gang checking in!  This is my first time batting a thousand for the week, increasing my account value by 24%. Including my April losses, I am now positive 35% for the year and up 65% since I started this strategy 13 weeks ago.   Every play was short strangles, mostly on weeklies but on the occasional monthly (IBM, MTB). Not only did all positions end up closing positive, every *contract* ended up closing positive.  This makes 11/13 positive weeks, with 1 loss and 1 wash. Every week I am up, I skim profits to do fun things like pay bills and reset my account back to base. I am getting closer and closer to only having "house money" in my account.  Special thanks to IBM, LOGI, LLNW, SYF, COF, UAL, IRBT, SNAP, AAL, LUV, TWTR, MTB, SKX, and AXP.  Honorable mention to INTC. I almost sold a strangle Thursday, but I weighed against it due to low IV. That would have made the week a whole lot different.  FWIW, I thought about playing TSLA, but the stock is just too expensive. Same always goes with AMZN. I would enter if I had more collateral.|2020-07-24 15:03:51

When the hard times roll around, however, your salary and bonus are viewed as the Achilles heel of the firm, and the wholesale slaughter of lower-rung guys is de rigueur at the first hint of a missed quarterly target.  Just about every employer will extol the virtue of teamwork, tell you that there's no "I" in "team", and tell you that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. And I'll admit that there is value in pulling together with others - as long as they're pulling in your direction. But do yourself a favor and consider the source.  You're An Unrestricted Free Agent. It's time to quit thinking like an employee and start thinking like the CEO of You, Inc. In the game of life, you're an unrestricted free agent. What you do in this life is entirely up to you. Maximize your personal profit. If that means your objectives temporarily align with your employer's, so much the better. But never forget that your objectives have to come first.”  Don’t feel guilty about pushing off that work boys.

The individual left the consulate and was arrested afterwards. He is now expected to show up at the California Eastern District Court.  The arrest comes after the US charged four Chinese researchers with visa fraud, saying they never disclosed being connected to the Chinese military when applying for the visa. Three of them were arrested on Thursday while the individual that was arrested today took refuge at the San Francisco consulate. Earlier, the US shut China's Houston consulate and China retaliated by closing the US consulate in Chengdu.  Bet safely|2020-07-24 10:00:39

z3lw6d|hwz949|hwz949|7|I think the volume here and in the market, and being 2 weeks removed now from tech peak is the signature of retail signing off. It was a hell of a run. Congress backtracking on stimulus, the dollar woes, bonds, Chinese rally over, airline passenger #s decreased for the first week in months, oil cratering, and with vaccine nowhere on the near term horizon is pretty much signaling that everything is too heavy for us regular folk to prop up anymore. Just a regular dip day isn't right. The deniers will buy the dip like on June 9, fight it out a bit during the day but this is a freefall futures weekend. Not a green Monday this time.

Corrosion of these valves on both engines could result in a dual-engine power loss without the ability to restart. This condition, if not addressed, could result in compressor stalls and dual-engine power loss without the ability to restart, which could result in a forced off-airport landing," the directive states.

USD looking like the Zimbabwe dollar.   10-year yield and gold movement from people who are actually trading and not just gambling their children’s college funds.   Uncertainty in US-China relations.   The influx of retail traders make certain movements on stocks almost unpredictable, but expect if we experience a Hang Seng day today that there will be a massive buy going into next week on stimulus hopes.

That is a good sign for it to make a move higher.  DIS is not pulling back but I am determined to wait for it and be bitter if it runs higher.  NVDA, MAR, SBUX, JPM, VIAC, CTL, and STOR are all within ranges.    AMD is a rocket.  I missed it and I do not feel I should step in here.  Lesson learned.  SPY hanging above 320.  We need more of a pullback. We need to come back to 315 if not lower and feel some pain so we can put more money to work.  The rotation will continue out of tech into other sectors.|2020-07-24 10:23:17

If we raise interest rates, banks will cry and whine and lower the market.    Pick your poison.  But I think interest rates are going up.|2020-07-24 08:25:25

z4iwst|hwz949|hwz949|2|Don't be fooled, it was clear for over a month that $600 unemplyment wasn't going to be extended. The news media likes lying and treating people like morons, Democrats could have put out legislation for an extension by itself, and that's what the media has been lying about being discussed, but what actually happened was the Democrats put in the "extension" in the "heroes" act which even some democrats don't want to pass.  Why is that relevant? Because the market was ***hoping*** that there would be "something" to extent or replace the $600 but there was never an individual bill, which means the Stock Market is going to lose it's damn mind on Monday.  However, the media fear has spooked the markets. near **70% of the tickers were down today** unless a few managed to barely make it over yesterdays line in the next 10 minutes as of this writing, which is absolutely bonkers. Good news for companies individually didn't even do anything.  The best case for the market is that they start on a plan on Monday as promised to either extend the unemplyment but shrink the $600 to something less OR release the next $1200 stiumulus much faster than the first one.  Personally I would have extended the $600 until the week after elections just to keep the market stable on that front. But over the weekend I expect there to be a lot of drama reporting to expect Monday to be red unless there is enough information confirming that a plan is emotion.  So be prepared accordingly, I wouldn't buy calls that expire this week just in case myself.|2020-07-24 14:58:51

At least AMZN relies on Chinese products. AAPL too, and they are affected by possible recessions.    But MSFT? You can't work without it.

I’m overly bullish and have options plays on   AMD though for my options plays I’m going to cut those loose today and just hold shares through earnings   Silver (SLV)   Gold (GLD, GDX)    If you think I’m stupid how to make money on this?
