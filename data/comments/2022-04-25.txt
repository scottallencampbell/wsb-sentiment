2rrsl4|o69r01|o69r01|6|I'm an idiot. With the world economy likely to revive AND the dollar undergoing inflation, how are SPY long calls thru next year *not* guaranteed money?    If the dollar defaults, the United States is already economically self-sufficient, can win a war vs China over the debt because invading the continental US is impossible. If the dollar survives, then the US stays globalist & SPY loses(?) money over the year, then everyone flocks back to the US markets when China starts a war with India & Taiwan sometime between 2027-2030    Idk I'm an idiot|2021-06-23 09:27:56

However, if you sell IPO shares within 30 days of the IPO, it's considered "flipping" and you'll be restricted from participating in IPOs for 60 days.  Issuing companies and their underwriters often try to avoid IPO stock flipping. Flipping could lead us to offer fewer IPOs in the future.*|2021-06-23 13:26:42

2s5asx|o69r01|o69r01|6|$MAPS    Guys I just want to explain something to you... I work in the cannabis industry in Colorado and I think Weedmaps is absolutely the biggest and most important listing any dispensary can have. Not being on Weedmaps is like not having your product advertised at all... and they are integrating with the ordering and delivery systems used by most dispensary businesses as well... this company reaps $3-5 thousand bucks per month per location for each client and they will only begin to generate more revenue and higher profit margins as they are already set up with a working delivery application that integrated with these highly regulated systems. No other business will be able to take market share without HUGE investment and perfect execution that works within the highly regulated framework of legal cannabis... this is too difficult and that means WM has carved out a massive niche and cornered the market already for the next 3-5 years.|2021-06-23 11:10:13

2syty9|o69r01|o69r01|6|I know we're not supposed to be too serious here, but anybody reading, please listen.  Make sure you are being disciplined. Make sure you understand and think about what you're doing.  Don't ever trade mad or emotionally. I made a YOLO and despite YEARS of being very disciplined and "knowing" all the right things like "don't risk what you aren't willing to lose" and "pigs get slaughtered" and "have defined risk for your trades" I never ONCE thought about the downside risk or exit strategies for the downside.  I never once thought "how much of this are you actually willing to lose?"  The worst part is the trade went very much in my favor...at first. It went up a bunch but when it just barely missed hitting my exit prices I got annoyed. I thought about selling and even felt very strongly that I should, but then the thought "what if it keeps going up?" came. I made the trade to begin with because I was upset and mad. I only defined my upside, but not my downside.  Then it dipped...and kept dipping...and kept dipping. And I could have sold for a profit at ANY point. But I didn't. For days. And then one day I was a bit in the red...but I was sure it would go back up, it had to...and I still didn't sell. And then on and on and on, never once really considering how bad it was getting and how I should just get out and cut my losses.  Be smart, don't be me. Look out for yourself and your bankroll. Even if you don't "need" the money it will haunt you when it's gone and the ghost never really goes away. So unless you want a monkey like that on your back for the rest of your life...be smart. Don't be me.|2021-06-23 14:47:55

2rwbel|o69r01|o69r01|2|I initiated a position in VLDR. Why I like it: they are diversified in technology such as TaaS and has multiple partnerships with major corps like Google, Ford, etc. I’ve enclosed a company timeline. The creator David Hall is a rock star who started Velodyne Acoustics and even cooler he competed and won several competitions in the first season of Robot Warriors (he built Drilzilla). After all of that you have a great company with sound fundamentals, strong leadership, and a pipeline of cutting edge products. The price is relatively low (11.60). I think they are doing a great job of finding and taking advantages of opportunities within the market. I’m sold. Good luck to you all.   https://velodynelidar.com/history/  Edit: I forgot to acknowledge the lead in my original post. I apologize. I want to give a shoutout to Anders at Green Bull Research for digging deep for this lead. Thanks.   https://greenbullresearch.com/ian-kings-maas-stock/|2021-06-23 10:03:21

2rbaj8|o69r01|o69r01|7|I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.|2021-06-23 06:54:58

Even if delisted, XPEV owners will still own shares and will have a place for them to be traded. This was many investor's fear.   Today should be an interesting day for the stock.🚀  [Approved for listing on Hong Kong Exchange ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/ev-maker-xpeng-said-to-get-nod-for-2-billion-hong-kong-listing)|2021-06-23 07:15:58

Why are we the worst amongst all the major airlines? This is unacceptable. You all knew this was coming. It’s all you talked about all year and yet you manage to piss away 2.8% of gross revenues and net profits, not to mention all the upgrades and miscellaneous add ons. Get more planes. Get more people. The solution is staring you in your dumb faces now fix it. Thank you. I’m still up today but news like that just pisses me off because they missed a big opportunity and they won’t be able to recoup those gains. They are gone forever, lost to the ether. Hope the other airlines enjoyed our peanuts. Good luck to all.  Edit: One last thing I forgot is that is just plain and simple shitty customer service. Need to step up your game on this one UAL.

Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted crude stockpiles would fall by 4.1 million barrels from the prior week.  Oil stored at Cushing, the delivery point for U.S. stocks, fell by 1.8 million barrels from the previous week, to 41.7 million barrels, the EIA said in its weekly report.

Already in COUP calls for Jan 2022, will ride till 275. already in TSLA debit spread will ride it till 750 before rolling.

2rc03r|o69r01|o69r01|-2|I’d look at Boston Omaha (BOMN) if you’re looking for a long term growth play that isn’t just another ETF. They’ve been referred to as a “Baby Berkshire”, one of Buffets nephews is on the board. They’re focused on acquiring positive cash flow, yet undervalued businesses, and have a presence in outdoor advertising, reinsurance and surety services, home loans,  auto loans, and broadband and data services, and I’m guessing they won’t stop there. They also have an acquisition company , Yellowstone if any of y’all like SPACs  Edit: I do mean long-term. Aside from index ETFs I view this as my only “untouchable” play. Everything else can ebb and flow. I used to work on consulting for this company, And now they can pay for even better consultants lol.

The hydrogen fuel cell producer received a downgrade from Canaccord Genuity following its earnings print. Analyst Jed Dorsheimer downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold and cut its price target by more than half from $69 to $31.  Plug Power reported revenue of $72 million, missing the consensus estimate of $76.87, and a quarterly loss of 12 cents, four cents less than the expected loss of 8 cents.  Options traders think Canaccord's price target may be an overreaction and just after 10 a.m. began purchasing call contacts of the stock. Together they bet $275,960 Plug Power is headed higher|2021-06-23 13:25:04
