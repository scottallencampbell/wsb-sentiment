hz8evh|wa5r0e|wa5r0e|11|AAPL earnings mini DD.  Sorry for sloppy formatting.  I'm too lazy to do much on mobile  About 85% of Apple revenue is hardware sales which is unique among big tech and actually closer to Amazon than Google.  2021 was a massively successful year for Apple due to stimmy (increased revenue of 33% YoY with iPhones up 42% YoY) compared to much smaller increases previous years (10-20%).  In fact, iPhone sales, the main driver, were actually declining prior to the pandemic.  All the new iPhones purchased in 2021 will likely dampen sales for next generation as iPhones do not need to be replaced every year.  Additonally, Q3 is already a low sales quarter due to anticipation of new iPhone release next quarter.  However,  this could actually mitigate a drop in sales this quarter as management could dismiss it as people just waiting for the new iPhone generation.    Altogether, I think AAPL is overvalued and primed for correction, especially since it has fallen the least among big tech. Basically, Apple is the biggest pandemic stock but hasn't yet come back to earth like ZOOM or Peleton or Amazon.  It is still priced like its 2021 performance will continue, but I think that is unlikely to be the case.  However,  that doesn't necessarily mean that this theory will be realized in this earnings report.    Other factors pointing to a big miss;  -Currency exchange rate (negative impact for approx 33% of revenue (Europe and Japan)  -China lockdowns and disturbances  Factors against a big miss:  Apple consumer typically wealthy and less impacted by inflation   Apple hasn't provides guidance, so bad guidance can't provide a negative shock.  Apple stock has cult status and it will be hard to drop unless the failure is very obvious  Positions: I plan to open Apple leap puts today.  I'm prepared to hold and add to the position over the next couple months if AAPL increases more  Source: https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/|2022-07-28 06:40:03

That has lead to people being leveraged up to their eyeballs.  They kicked the can be handed out free money time and time again.  At some point, when there are no more tools in the feds toolbox, the road will come to an end.

i13qjq|wa5r0e|wa5r0e|7|When are boomers expected to start dying off?  I‚Äôm starting to think the market will go up until the average age of death for them.    The generation that was born after two massive wars, had cheap housing / college, managed to give themselves massive tax breaks, fucked up the environment, and still control the government and economy.

C- average marketing major part time.   **Core Holdings:** 74 OTM puts expiring tomorrow worth $0.02 each and 1 fractional share of PLTR stock (his hedge).  **Reason for betting against SPY:** "Well me an 12.4m other highly regarded geniuses all agreed stocks would go down, so we all bet on the same trade at the same time because when a lot of money goes into a sure thing, it *has to happen or that's unfair and very unchill"*  **Reason for holding:** "This corruption will have to end eventually. Also, my boys and I are commenting FUD in the wsb daily, so this thing should crash 20% any hour now"  **Reason he got into trading:** "I wanted impress girls to get more pussy. I havent gotten any pussy *yet*, but I'd like to get more of it, *you know?"*  **Reason he stays trading:** "Complaining about how fake and corrupt the markets are with the other dudes losing money feels like my  college fraternity. I think of my excess earnings as dues I'm required to pay so I can earn the honor of complaining with the other fellas"    **Plans to limit losses in the future**: "None. I'll just do the same thing until it works. When it does- I'll see that as proof of my genius. Then I'll keep doing it until I lose it all and more."|2022-07-28 13:25:46

Quick note bears, there's this thing called nuance that exists in the world. While negative GDP for two quarters is an indicator of a recession, it is not THE indicator of a recession and must be considered alongside other factors. Everything isn't black and white for fucks sake.  Edit: Bears be salty, but that's fine.

hzisct|wa5r0e|wa5r0e|1|DKNG 20c 9/16 are probably the best lotto tickets out there right now.  Seems like bullish info this week indicating a true market bottom, DKNG ER is next week, NFL run up tends to start mid-late August, and 9/16 is after Week 1 of the NFL. For the ER I'd be curious if they start hinting at scaling back cash burn on marketing or when the project profitability.  At only $20 a contract it's worth grabbing some since I don't think it's unreasonable to see it run well north of 20 even if it comes back down my November like it has the last two years. I figure it either approaches 30 or just fucks around in the low-mid teens.  But last august people had no problem running it from 40 to 60.

Plot twist: Both parties are most likely baggies. Very few go long and short. Therefore your average user here is 90% likely a baggie. The user that posted before you? Bull? Most likely baggie. The bear that posted before you? Most likely a baggie. So don‚Äôt think your the only one getting rekt.

If there was really a 1/5 chance of a 100 bps hike and that would have pushed BTC down 2.5k, then the removal of that risk should only have bumped price like $500/coin.  Stated differently. If this is the proper price at 23.5k and it was 21.5k yesterday. Then the expected drop from a different Powell decision would have been -8k?

Electric Vehicle tax credits will continue at their current levels, up to $4,000 for a used electric vehicle and $7,500 for a new EV. However, there will be a lower income threshold for people who can use the tax credits -- a key demand of Manchin's. Manchin had been staunchly opposed to electric vehicle tax credits throughout negotiations.*  [Sauce](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/schumer-manchin-deal-build-back-better/index.html)|2022-07-28 05:30:05
