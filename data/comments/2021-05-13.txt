y0ndi8|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|15|this market is fuckin stupid man. i just transferred a lot money out of my account because i clearly have no idea what's going on. Still up 54% and seriously about to only buy shares of index funds from now on and fuck off. I start therapy on monday. 2020 was great with stonks; i made money and had fun. But shit is getting back to normal and i think it best if i don't squander all my time and money on this retarded shit. I'm not going to beat the market. I don't even care about all this. I don't want to be on yahoo finance 2+ hours a day or waking up in a frenzy when the market opens.   yesterday everything was crashing because of inflation and today the market doesn't care??? this game is designed to take my fucking money. i'm worn out and just want to live well. i'm still up so i'm getting the fuck out while i can man. i'll still play with cheap FDs here and there because i can afford it and it's fun but no more yolos   i am a boomer now. i just want to make music, skate, and hangout with my friends|2021-05-13 14:56:22

y03r9t|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|10|tl;dr: Banks realized they were lending too much and don't wanna get caught with their pants down.  The reason for the selloff is the reserve requirement:  [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm)  It's been at 0 for over 14 months straight. For those that don't know, this is the percentage of their capital banks must maintain in order to secure their loans. Typically a reserve requirement of about 10% will ensure something like a 7x money multiplier. When it's reduced to 0, banks can lend each other money back and forth with no regard for maintaining a balance. This combined with low interest rates means financial institutions went crazy with leverage.  JPow said he isn't raising interest rates. However, anyone with eyeballs can see inflation taking hold on almost every commodity, even Yellen sees it. Putting 2 and 2 together, they have to curb inflation but they don't want to raise the rates, so they'll force banks to be more fiscally responsible with their lending and speculation by raising the reserve requirements.  This hasn't been announced but the writing is on the wall. The selloff happening is banks reeling in their crazy lending spree and shoving that cash back into their vaults to meet the requirements they expect to be in place shortly. Since so much on the market was traded using leverage this is having a huge deflationary effect on speculative markets, even as real assets double in value.|2021-05-13 12:42:52

xzza25|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|3|I don't know how to hedge. I've tried over fears of losing all my last year gains.  It just leads to more losses.  If market DOES begin to fall and I strike gains with my hedge, I sell it. Like way too early. I sold two days ago for measly returns, and the market continued to fall for two more days.   And if you don't sell, market rallies back and the point of having the hedge is moot.  So wtf reddit.  Done with hedges, and puts.    Only calls, and buying dips.  Although some say dont BTD right now, only STR (sell the rip, ie. puts at the top instead of calls at bottom).  So maybe right now is a good time for puts. But I know it'll lose me money.|2021-05-13 12:11:40

Bearish  1.4 x 12 = $17  Neutral  1.4 x 15 = $21  Bullish  1.4 x 20 = $28  Euphoric  1.4 x 40 = $56   We are bouncing between bearish and neutral.

If it expires above 411 tomorrow, I get another $1.  If not, I get my 0.78.  I'm PDT limited, so I don't burn a day trade.  Obviously picking direction doesn't always work, but sometimes it can be pretty high probability for quick intraday moves.  What am I missed that says this is a bad strategy?

Sex shops are practically the only fucking place I can take her out in public, but that gets old fast.  A library?  Forget it!  I tried to get her a boyfriend, but even that didn't work...  Long story short, when the new neighbors moved in, they obviously had no idea...but they definitely heard it!  One day, it was a really "bad" day for her, and the neighbors were home.  They must have been thinking, "God, that woman must be a nympho!"  I put my head out of our window and yelled, "No, GME is going up!"|2021-05-13 13:07:22

With all the shit that happened and with how much of the world is in crisis mode due to covid? Who actually thinks this is sustainable? I know its fun to be a permabull and continually go up but this is beginning to scare me  How much longer can this market last? Even the "corrections" that happend over the past few months were relatively minor, go to almost any stock or etf chart and you will see its just a straight line up from 2018 to 2019 to present day.

Oil prices are near breaking out which would be terrible as well as input prices like lumber and steel going up, plus chip shortage.. Lots of inflationary forces on the supply side.. Yet demand is gay. We still have a high savings rate and people paying off debt. More people unemployed = more uncertainty = people not spending their stimmies = stagflation  Economy is just trash in general. We need 2.4Trillion spending plan to bring back jobs which is going to increase corporate tax rates = stocks fucked again.|2021-05-13 07:06:26

This is very close to the 44M on an average day.  There is nothing preventing you from selling AMD on any given day.  500M shares have traded hands in the last 10 days.  Any big sellers should have already been done and the new buyers are assumed to be holders of the stock for at least a couple of weeks because they cant have made any money.  Who the F is still selling this thing so much that it is causing downward pressure even on a big up day?

Many of you are probably too young to remember how devastating hard rate hikes can be, when they hit, for assets.  You've only grown up in an environment of cheap ass money from 2008 to present that's resulted in a historic bullrun.  The party is over, and you'll learn the hard way what  a real bear market feels like when the govt can't QE and turn on the printer to artificially prop up asset values.|2021-05-13 10:31:39

y08wew|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|-3|Unpopular opinion (if you really believe the tin foil theory that HF completely control the price):  HF's cause these huge intraday spikes in GME. They use that opportunity to sell naked calls at hugely inflated premiums. They then suppress the price shortly after and ensure the naked calls always expire worthless. Thus allowing them to continue to raise crazy capital off the greatly inflated premiums. This offsets any loss they may incur from any short positions still not covered. Leaving them fairly unfazed.  &#x200B;  I mean, go look at the GME chart. Almost every day there is a 5-10% spike followed by a fairly quick fall. The open interest and premium on OTM calls goes through the roof in those spikes, then it all settles down. Rinse and repeat. Normally this wouldn't be viable, as most people wouldn't buy 20%+ OTM calls on a random spike, but based off what has happened with GME people definitely will.  &#x200B;  Edit: the massive amount of downvotes confirms this is indeed an unpopular opinion lol. Every time I mention this I'm met with a barrage of downvotes, yet no arguments why this couldn't truly be happening.|2021-05-13 13:17:32

xzge57|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|1|"After soaring more than 700% in 2020, Tesla (TSLA) is down nearly 10% this year. Half the legendary FANG stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX), are down this year, too. And many of the popular "short squeeze" stocks like GameStop (GME) and ViacomCBS (VIAC) lost 40% or more of their value in just the past two months.        Meanwhile, money is pouring into low-cost and diversified ETFs, Rosenbluth says.        The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) took in more than $21 billion in fresh money this year, including $2.7 billion in just the past month, CFRA says. That's more than any other ETF. But close behind is the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which includes smaller companies. It took in more than $15 billion this year. Shares of Vanguard S&P 500 and Vanguard Total Stock Market are up 8.5% and 7.7%, respectively this year."|2021-05-13 09:57:50

xz2gl9|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|-9|$UWMC ULTIMATE DD        By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! 🚀 (No that’s not a typo)        So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?        The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That’s big money ! But let’s dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.        104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says “We can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !”        So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it’s higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.        This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%        Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.        On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.        This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn’t park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?        My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c        TL,DR 🏘=💵💵💵💵 = UWMC 🚀🚀🚀🤑        Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??|2021-05-13 08:10:28

If you don’t know TA then go find a good discord server that calls out what to buy, when to buy, and when to sale.  5.

xzg8a0|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|-12|In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online.|2021-05-13 09:56:38

xzea5a|nbd3jq|nbd3jq|-20|In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online.|2021-05-13 09:42:38
