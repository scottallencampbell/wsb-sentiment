qbkd99|rqdcs6|rqdcs6|1|For a fun play, checkout call options on $MIME.   They are cheap because in principal a sale has been agreed to at $80, but that deal has been panned by the shareholders and analysts as too low. At various times the stock traded in the $90s when the deal was first rumored.  But, there is a period until January 6th where $MIME is shopping around for a better deal. There has been enough unusual option activity to make me interested.  If you guys like yolos, check out some calls right at the 80 strike - you can longdate for insurance as well. Downside is if the deal holds you wont retain value, but even a bump to $85 on the sale is likely a big profit.   My pick is May22 $80 strike.|2021-12-28 14:29:06
