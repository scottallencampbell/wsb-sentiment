yyq1zj|czjcda|czjcda|67|Hey everyone, haven't posted in awhile. No, I'm not dead nor am I stuck in a hurricane as one person suggested. Lost a "significant amount" the other week and wasn't feeling too great (95k). Took a break from shitposting in order to concentrate and focus on making money even though I still modded around here. Have made about 75-80% of the losses back and am within striking distance of my ATH. Am still trying to improve as a trader. Losses were mostly from futures because I have a hard time taking small losses, and my position size was too large. Today I plan to take profits and go short if /ES goes to the 2935-2940 range. I have contracts on all the indices and will close out all and focus on scalping ES afterwards. If /ES doesn't reach my profit taking zone, I may close out above my stop loss and enter short if that seems to be the direction it's going. Other than futures, I am still playing with AMZN, TSLA, NDX, and SPX. Short calls on AMZN are in trouble if the market continues up. Short call strikes of 1815, 1835, and 1850 for this week. My upside breakeven is around $1872, so I still have 3-4% cushion from current premarket price. Thanks for reading.|2019-09-04 06:58:40

Those 21 members were essentially kicked out of the Conservative party, via Johnson’s orders.  Boris is now calling for snap elections, but may not have the votes to do even that.  Boris has stated that he may proceed with a no-deal Brexit, regardless of what the legislature says.  He had promised to NOT delay Brexit again, so he has some rational at least.  In that case, parliament may have a vote of no confidence, which would upend the UK’s government yet again!|2019-09-04 15:31:52

Let it play out this week, let the FED come out less dovish than expectations with little to no rate cut, fire off some block sells to spawn a sell the news event and let it fall just in time to collect sweet sweet profit on the derivatives while picking up a decent premium on their shares.

I might get back to an **ALL TIME HIGH**, sometime today.  Unfortunately, that just means money has been FLAT for twenty months of roller-coastery tariff-based madness. I feel queasy and ill.

yzzvvi|czjcda|czjcda|1|I'm going to spam this a few times until an autist whisperer weighs in:  Honest question seeking honest answers:  Say for DLTR, I have a bunch of scattered calls throughout the next calendar year, and they're all up (naturally). Right now, only theta is my enemy because Mango and JPow aren't going to have too much influence on it long term. If an event in the future (investor day) with a known date, and expected announcement to shoot the stock up 5% at least, what's the best play?  Right before the event: Would it be to close all current positions and redistribute them to the expected strike that would then be ITM after the announcement? Keep the OTM calls and sell/redistribute any current-ITM calls?  Take the DIS+ thing for example, if someone had done a bunch of moves prior to their investor day, knew the time and expected magnitude of move, what would have been the smartest play? Obviously that 20k yolo was the best move, but what if he already made gains across a bunch of strikes/dates in advance?  Imagine that you have fixed capital and can't continuously keep adding.|2019-09-04 15:06:36

yzbdp4|czjcda|czjcda|1|Honest question seeking honest answers:  Say for DLTR, I have a bunch of scattered calls throughout the next calendar year, and they're all up (naturally). Right now, only theta is my enemy because Mango and JPow aren't going to have too much influence on it long term.  If a binary event in the future (investor day) with a known date, and expected announcement to shoot the stock up 5% at least, what's the best play?   Right before the event: Would it be to close all current positions and redistribute them to the expected strike that would then be ITM after the announcement? Keep the OTM calls and sell/redistribute any current-ITM calls?  Take the DIS+ thing for example, if someone had done a bunch of moves prior to their investor day, knew the time and expected magnitude of move, what would have been the smartest play?  Imagine that you have fixed capital and can't continuously keep adding.|2019-09-04 11:18:02

I'm seeing that inflation was reported at 1.8% on August 13th, up from 1.6% previously.  Is this evidence then that the 0.25 rate cut on July 31st was in fact able to boost inflation a bit? *Not really, because the data released in August is from July. So even before the cut, we were seeing increasing inflation.*  The next inflation report is coming September 12th, before the Fed makes their next rate decision. Their target inflation rate is 2.0%, so if they see on September 12th that we're up to, say, 1.9% inflation they probably won't cut.|2019-09-04 08:34:34
