b0ncju|jn7ua1|jn7ua1|10|From my notes on March 5th: market had experienced a 1,000 point rally after Biden became the presumptive nominee and the field threw their support behind him. Market ended up crashing the following week.  IMO today is a relief rally and puts are on sale. We‚Äôre still in a pretty significant downtrend. Also don‚Äôt think many are considering the possibility of a split White House and senate and what the implications of that would be for stimmy. R/R on DIA/QQQ/IWM puts is good here but I‚Äôll probably wait to see if we get a massive 1,000+ point rally into the close, which feels likely.|2020-11-03 10:27:54

b0obm5|jn7ua1|jn7ua1|2|Anyone ever get a cramp in one side of their neck? Like at the front, the muscle just tightens up and your mouth gets pulled down slightly. It usually takes like 20 seconds then it loosens up slowly, but in that time that side of your face from the mouth down gets pulled like you're having a stroke. Anyway last time I smoked some weed I got paranoid "what if I was actually having a stroke all those times and I've actually had like 100 strokes?" and I got all nervous about being severely retarded as a consequence. Then an hour later I was drunk thinking 100 strokes... THAT'S COOL. 100 STROKES AND I'M STILL WALKING.

b0ck1u|jn7ua1|jn7ua1|1|** The meeting came after Mr Ma criticised China‚Äôs state-owned banks at a financial summit in Shanghai at the end of October. Jack Ma suggested the big banks had a ‚Äúpawnshop mentality** ‚Äù and that Ant was playing an important role in extending credit to innovative but collateral-poor companies and individuals.  At the same summit, however, Wang Qishan, China‚Äôs vice-president, emphasised the importance of financial stability. ‚ÄúThere should be a fine balance between encouraging financial innovation, invigorating the market, opening up the financial sector and building regulatory capacity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSafety always comes first.‚Äù  Before announcing the timing of the IPO, Ant executives met with PBoC officials this summer to seek their blessing, according to two senior group executives. Despite receiving assurances, there have long been voices sceptical of Ant within the PBoC and China‚Äôs banking and insurance regulator, which views itself as the champion of the country‚Äôs biggest lenders.  ‚ÄúI've never seen an IPO suspended at this stage‚Äù said a director at one Shanghai-based brokerage, who described the decision to suspend Ant's dual listing as a ‚Äúvery last minute thing".  ‚ÄúIt's in no one's interest to cancel the allocations at this stage,‚Äù the director added, ‚Äúbut I don't think there's any precedent for this type of situation.‚Äù|2020-11-03 08:58:50

Only way the market going back to stonks only go up is if Biden wins but Senate remains republican, blocking all policy changes.  Under this condition it's safe to continue buying all the dips.  Under a Biden victory and Democrats winning Senate majority, I'd sell any after election rally and buckle up.

He likes high pressure so I suggest you start working on your water blowing technique you sack of retards.   The only certainty in this pandemic is that people will die, airlines are fucked and the high quality chinese stocks will always weather the storm. Never forget to wash your asses folks. New findings have come out that people that only wipe with paper are 500000% more likely to not get their assholes eaten more than once by the same person. Hope this helps.   If I were you I would wire transfer me all of your money so I can make your parents proud, then I will build a school to educate your children as to why their parents were such idiots and lost their college tuition listening to some fuds on a sub reddit instead of actually learning and making their own fucking decisions.   Oh and it goes without saying... Gold and silver will reach all time highs following new stimulus. Instead of burning your money in shit stocks, make some metal plays whilst listening to enter sandman before crying yourself to sleep tonight fuckos.|2020-11-03 08:10:21

azxuus|jn7ua1|jn7ua1|-12|My girlfriend has chosen a nickname, out of nowhere, for my penis. She has chosen, for some god forsaken reason, to call it 'princess little piddles'. I have no idea where she got this name but it's not the most manly nickname, and honestly, I don't even have a nickname for it so why should she?? Every time she calls it by her nickname, I feel ashamed!  Am I the asshole for making her stop calling it that? Or should I just let her keep it up? I'm afraid this waking nightmare may never end.  UPDATE: I spoke with my girlfriend regarding this nickname fiasco. She informed me that it was not the princess that was little, it was the piddles that were little. That didn't make me feel much better tho.  I offered another nickname, per another user, "princess big and long piddles" but she said that was a mouthful. We compromised on allowing me to pick a nickname for her penis. Thanks everyone.|2020-11-03 06:26:17
