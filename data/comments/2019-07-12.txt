tm2u55|cc9g83|cc9g83|11|OK /u/vocoderasmr  Stipulation was MWF would be green more often and T Th red more often.  So tl;dr – basically it seems Tuesdays and Fridays are the most bullish looking back 3 years, the rest have been mixed in terms of flat/green/red.  My analysis is probably compromised because I looked at 3 years and the analysis would probably be better done at an annual level, if not monthly, but unless there’s any appetite for it I’m going to stop now and eat my lunch.  Here’s the brief rundown.  I pulled 3 years of data on SPY and looked at overall, and then by day of the week.  I define green as over 0.05% up for the day, flat as between -0.05% and 0.05%, and red for under 0.05%.  I also look at previous day close to next day close (so comparing Friday’s close to Thursday’s close) and open to close on the same day.  I will say close to close, then a forward slash, then open to close.  **For the full 3 years**   Green – 50.4% / 47.5%   Flat – 9.4% / 12.2%   Red – 40.2%  /40.3%    So yeah, makes sense, market has gone up considerably over 3 years, but TBH I figured we’d see far more green than red, or maybe a super majority when you combine green and flat (more than 66%).  Also it’s neat to me how no matter which way you cut it red days are about 40% of the time, but green drops a bit when you are looking more at open to close and that makes sense as we often see movement overnight.  **Mondays**   Green – 52.1% / 43.6%   Flat – 10% / 12.9%   Red – 37.9% / 43.6%    Looks like Mondays overall close to close are bullish, but open to close a mixed bag.  **Tuesdays** Green – 52.6% / 46.1%   Flat – 9.1% / 14.5%   Red – 38.3% / 39%    Overall Tuesdays are more often bullish.  **Wednesdays** Green – 47.7% / 48.4%   Flat – 14.2% / 9.0%   Red – 38.1% / 42.6%    Wednesdays more similar to Mondays in terms of mixed bags.  **Thursdays** Green – 46.4% / 46.4%   Flat – 9.2% / 13.1%   Red – 44.4% / 40.5%    Thursdays actually seem to be a mixed bag as well, not so much the BlOoDy ThUrSdAy people worry about.  **Friday** Green – 50.7% / 51.3%   Flat – 7.8% / 13%   Red – 41.6% / 35.7%    Fridays seem to be the most bullish overall.  But a 51% average up finish isn’t exactly a slam dunk, more like a coin flip.  There’s so much more I did, but the stipulation was MWF would be better more often than not compared with TTh and the data suggests that Fridays and Tuesdays are most bullish with the rest beaing more mixed/flat.  My guess is because I picked a year and a half or so of bullish data and then over a year of meh/sideways data.  Is this really worth any time… I had fun doing it, but we know the market went up (mostly) the last 3 years.  It would probably be better to look at each year separate.  I would expect 2016 and 2017 to be higher percentage of days flat/bullish, and then 2018 to have far more mixed/bearish days thrown in.  If there’s any interest, I have the data and can slice it however.|2019-07-12 12:00:33

Final demand prices moved up 0.1 percent in  May and 0.2 percent in April. (See table A.) On an unadjusted basis, the final demand index rose  1.7 percent for the 12 months ended in June, the lowest rate of increase since advancing 1.7  percent in January 2017.  In June, the rise in final demand prices is attributable to a 0.4-percent increase in the index for  final demand services.

tlrvfu|cc9g83|cc9g83|4|The weed sector is not oversold. I used to be one of the biggest bulls out there, but the writing was on the wall a couple quarters ago.   Canntrust is probably not going to exist soon, canopy is having problems turning a profit. All the other firms are running into the same issues, which is that the price of weed is dropping yoy while derivatives aren't anywhere close to seeing their potential realized due to slow legislation and strict regulations. Canada is a small ass market, and while some of these companies have US penetration it's just not happening fast enough stateside from a legal perspective.   They're sinking tons of money into r&d that probably wont be fully monetized for another 5 or 10 years. What you're going to see start happening is more cases like canntrust. Some of these companies are diluted out the ass (Aurora) and others hardly even have a product to speak of (cronos) while they continue to burn cash and command sky high multiples.   When the dust settles and all is said and done, most of these companies will have either A) gone under ala canntrust B) been absorbed by another firm or C) be absorbed by a large scale US corporation ala MO, STZ, TAP, GWPH, etc.   Some positive near term catalysts would be US banks lending to these companies, the US legalizing, or other international markets legalizing (Germany, UK, etc) but once again, that's a ways off from where we are now.   TL;DR: high burn rate+shrinking margins+unrealized market penetration+unrealized product potential=these stocks are going dooooooown boi.

tmh9nm|cc9g83|cc9g83|2|BofA on NFLX exogenous noise (TLDR: buy puts because BofA says calls)  "Competition, content worry is noise, not a signal; Buy** We see most near term risks for Netflix as fleeting, with structural growth expected to hold. Competitive noise from Disney/HBO Max/Apple launch plans, content departures and potential for weak domestic subs amid price hikes could shake confidence briefly. The loss of “Friends” and “The Office” is not all bad as 1) the company can redeploy spending on originals, potentially slowing budget growth to the benefit of FCF, 2) we see the sitcom genre as filler content rather than a key driver of signups, 3) all of the top ten most watched TV show seasons in 1Q were originals according to Netflix, cooling worry about content losses. We would see any dip around these worries as an enhanced buying opportunity because we do not see Disney/HBO as the competition and we expect, as has happened before, any price hike driven increase in churn to be short-lived as consumers come back for Netflix’s content. We reiterate our Buy rating and PO of $450"|2019-07-12 14:31:33

This really troubled me, so I asked the Muskrat about it.   "Elon, you said once I decided to follow you we would go to Mars together, both of us. But I have so many loses I can never buy a Tesla, not even a Model 3.”  He whispered, "My precious child, I love you and will never leave you. Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of profits, It was then that I created the Model 3 leasing program."|2019-07-12 10:17:09

Or if you only want a weekly roundup, use the subject ['wallstreetbets weekly'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&subject=wallstreetbets%20weekly&message=x)  However, I can do more.. you can have me search  for any keywords you want on any subreddit you want. Send a message with the subject ['set wallstreetbets'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&subject=set%20wallstreetbets&message=200%0A25%2C%20keyword1%2C%20another keyphrase%2C%20last example) and in the message: specify a number of upvotes that must be reached, and then an optional list of keywords you want to search for, separated by commas. You can have as many lines as you'd like, as long as they follow this format:      200       50, keyword1, another keyphrase, last example    You can also do ['set wallstreetbets weekly'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&subject=set%20wallstreetbets%20weekly&message=200%0A25%2C%20keyword1%2C%20another keyphrase%2C%20last example) And you can replace wallstreetbets with any subreddit.

tlyg5q|cc9g83|cc9g83|0|Bears: Stay home next week. For realsies. There are stocks you can trade and make some cheddar. But shorting QQQ/SPY will get you nowhere. BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR BEARS: We trade between the 298-302 channel for the whole week. 298 is the absolute lowest we'll go without some game-changing news.     Shorting QQQ/SPY reminds me of P-Escobar burning hundreds of Ks to keep his daughter warm when they were running from the cops. It's cute and heart warming, but it won't get you very far.     TL;DR:   Bulls- Keep doing what you're doing   Bears- Only stick to stocks you know are due for a correction     Let's make some $$$$$$$|2019-07-12 11:15:07
