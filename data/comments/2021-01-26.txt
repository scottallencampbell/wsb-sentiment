Listen up, because this is important.  TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.  Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.  You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.  Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.  We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.  TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.|2021-01-26 07:40:29

kt9ifc|l5brzz|l5brzz|567|Just translated something from german wsb.  The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .   It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).  The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.   For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.  And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .  Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.  Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility 🚀✋🏻💎🤚🏻,  **Don't be a paper bitch!**  All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!  **This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.** **Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.**  And now relax America won't open for another 4 hours anyway.

Its exposure to some of the most promising tech markets in the world should keep investors betting on it this decade. BlackBerry boasts a footprint in automotive software development, it is a cyber security leader, and one of the few Canadian companies that possesses one of the largest patent troves in the world. Moreover, the stock also offers exposure to artificial intelligence development. BlackBerry has set itself up for the long term under the leadership of CEO John Chen. The possibilities are endless for this tech stock in the years ahead. Investors should not be shy about stacking its shares for the long term.|2021-01-26 07:34:11

DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.  These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.  Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.  Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.  This is a repost!!!!!!|2021-01-28 10:06:37

ktadov|l5brzz|l5brzz|53|Here to enlist for duty in the battle against short sellers!  You kiddos have done a great job on the front lines.  Hopefully yesterday was the bloodiest day off the battle.  I'm a late 30s (boomer?) professor, startup founder, and typically conservative investor but have been waiting for over 10 years for a chance to fight short sellers (especially institutional).  Ever since John Stewart exposed Cramer lying about his part in short selling and market manipulation.  After doing some independent DD, short sellers are in big trouble.    Bringing friends and family with me.    Your backup support should be starting to arrive around 7:00am EST (I and most of my friends use Tastyworks which opens pre market trading at 7).|2021-01-26 05:21:37

ktkrjj|l5brzz|l5brzz|29|I don’t know who to tell this to, so I guess I’ll just post it here. My son sent me a chilling message today from the future begging me not to buy the shares of BB that I planned on buying at the dip today. He said he inherited those shares after losing me in a very mysterious accident after I divorced my 7th wife. Apparently, those very shares of BB make me a multi-millionaire by the end of this year and I reinvested all the earnings into FD’s that make me the second ever wsb billionaire after DFV. I spend much of the next 10 years getting shit hammered and doing coke with models all over the world. My son is born sometime during that window but he doesn’t meet me till much later. By 33 I’ve settled down on the coke and spend most of my time on LSD and with models. That’s why my 3rd wife ends up leaving me for her boyfriend. Anyway, I enter my kids life once I hear about him and he says I’m a great father when I’m sober, but was hesitant to say if he ever saw me that way more than once. Fast-forward a bit through the personal stuff and he says he misses me. He found me dead in the living room and he suspects foul play. He thinks so because I was pretty young still, didn’t have any underlying health conditions, and he didn’t remember me having 17 stab wounds in my chest. Whatever happened, he swears he got his brains from me and he’ll get to the bottom of it. The Coroner’s report will be coming out in a few days and he thinks that DD will help. But above all, his message was crystal clear, “do not buy shares of BB because they will make you too rich.”|2021-01-26 07:33:06

If you didn't buy shares, buy shares and put them up for sale for an extremely high price. That way, shorters cannot borrow shares. 2. Stay positive to encourage other buys. Do not put down the other investments -- it will only cause others to put down your investments. New people see this and panic for no reason. GME has not passed. BB is not a waste of time. NOK is not a shill 3. Do NOT sell at random spikes. That's the boomers trying to bait you.|2021-01-26 09:58:27

This is a treasure trove and extremely hard to do due to antiquated gov systems and secrecy. This is a hard moat. GET IN WHILE YOU CAN 🚀🚀🚀|2021-01-26 07:50:37

kui5fb|l5brzz|l5brzz|8|**THE MODS KEEP DELETING MY POSTS DISCUSSING BOTS AND FEAR MONGERING**     As it's already been pointed out, this is quite possibly the most powerful online investment community to exist. WSB has gotten attention from major news networks and some of the most powerful portfolios in the world.  I won't speak of any ticker is particular because I don't want to start a flame war, I instead would like to offer some perspective that I think might be important to keep in mind as we move forward as a community.  &#x200B;  First off, **there are absolutely bots here** promoting different tickers ranging from the most popular tickers on the internet to some random pink-slip bullshit. We can't deny that, and the mods are doing a good job filtering posts intended to push garbage into our laps.  Let's not forget, however, that the reason our investment community has become so notorious is due to our confidence and success in value investment identification. For all of the various different tickers being heavily discussed here currently, read cautiously and take into account both [user sentiment](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment), [financial data](https://finance.yahoo.com/), and important news that will impact these companies.  Just because something is being talked about by a lot of users does not mean it's the "enemy" trying to manipulate the community. I've noticed a large number of people in this community who put a lot of time into DD and making quality posts, only to be shut down by others because they're afraid that outsiders are trying to damage WSB.  Who's to say the people making bot accusations aren't actually the "enemy" trying to discourage future success in this community? **The fear mongering and paranoia will damage us more than some shithead bots being filtered out by the mods.**  It has been repeatedly demonstrated that WSB has chosen to follow good value investment strategy, and our community is finding success as a result. Our community will continue on this track so long as we invest with both sentiment *and* fundamentals in mind.  &#x200B;  I love you retards and I'm proud to be part of this community. Thanks for reading and I hope this means something to you guys.|2021-01-26 11:52:03

The real story is Melvin Capital selling shares which they did not own on a scale of billions. And then this week another hedge fund swoops in with billions to further manipulate price and pin it below the 115 strike. All of the RH/Reddit traders combined don't even come close to a small fraction of the capital these guys are swinging.  But, CNBC are journalists and they're desperate for sources to talk to them. Can't burn any bridges with the Melvins and Citadels of the world can you?  Do your fucking job. Have some goddamn integrity and grit.

kuyl4g|l5brzz|l5brzz|6|Here's how you do it:  Step 1: Monki get Job or have Moni.  Step 2: Monki get stock with some of Moni, spend some Moni on make Monki happi.  Step 3: Monki hold stock Monki believe in based on science and magic.  Step 4: If Monki right stock becomes worth more Moni and Monki doesn't have to work as hard.  Step 4.a: If Monki wrong, stock becomes worth less Moni and Monki has to work the same unless the place where he got that item goes out of business. Monki knows this doesn't happen suddenly, it is usually pretty obvious. Monki holds stock so that one day Monki can trade for more Moni or same Moni at least.  Step 5: Monki keep working, invest more Moni and learn how to do better over time. Investments make Monki happier and mean Monki can work less and eat more Tendies.  Step 6: Monki takes new skills and teaches other Monkis in their own circle so every Monki can work less, be happy, and eat more Tendies.|2021-01-26 13:44:21

kup69k|l5brzz|l5brzz|25|The fact that blackberrys qnx technology is already in 175m cars and last night baidu partnership announced this thing is going to start flying.   “WATERLOO, ONTARIO – June 23, 2020 – BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced that its QNX® software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today. This is an increase of 25 million cars since the company last reported its automotive footprint in June 2019.  BlackBerry has a broad portfolio of functional safety-certified and secure software including its QNX operating system, development tools and middleware for autonomous and connected vehicles. Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry® QNX® software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.  “In the past five years we’ve gone from BlackBerry QNX technology helping to power 60 million cars to today’s announcement of more than 175 million – a nearly threefold increase and a testament to the fact that today’s leading automakers and their tier one suppliers continue to put their trust in BlackBerry and our ability to provide them with safe and secure software upon which the next generation of vehicles is being built,” said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry.”  Don’t sleep on this one.

kugzit|l5brzz|l5brzz|6|I have been doing my best to spread this word to reduce the amount of spam from both bots and users complaining about bots. Unfortunately I have to go into a meeting now but if you would like please feel free to copy and paste this in other users complaints about bots or even in assumed bot accounts. Most importantly report the bots.      1. Accounts must be 30 days or older to comment. go ahead try it.   2. **If you think an account is a bot, report it.** The mods cannot possibly go through every single comment. But if you report something it will add it to their mod queue meaning that they can go to the comments directly.   3. They have to be decently careful, while there does appear to be a lot of bots, there are also real users attempting the same thing.    4. Specifically with the growth of the sub in these last few weeks, new users tend to follow the trend of others, meaning more spam of tickers. **if you want less ticker spam then actively try and provide better content.**|2021-01-26 11:44:30

Like that are straight up trying to plan stock pumps:  That isn’t what we do here. And the media probably has you think that is what we do here. But the GME train was started organically. Wasnt some WSB vote to decide what to pump. It was just a meme stock that turned into a legit play organically. So stop trying to make your pump and dumps work.  Like we don’t have a GME thread because we were planning a coordinated play. There is a GME thread because we got tired of “GME 🚀🚀🚀” being the literal only comments in the daily threads.|2021-01-26 06:33:05

ktkbf7|l5brzz|l5brzz|6|$FB with earnings tomorrow is an interesting one this week. I sense extreme bullishness despite the stock performing horribly for weeks leading up to the rush into it ahead of earnings over the past week. I think there is a very decent possibility they sandbag guidance and the stock dives given the relative weakness over the past several months. I believe there are a couple of reasons they might do this. Given all these factors I’m eyeing weekly OTM puts. Will have to see how it does today and tomorrow.|2021-01-26 07:28:26

Listen up, because this is important.  TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.  Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.  You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.  Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.  We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.  TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.|2021-01-26 07:58:46

kuvqpg|l5brzz|l5brzz|12|#DD POST  Alright so why have the usual suspects (TSLA, AAPL, AMD, AMZN, etc.) been stagnating? I think we've had an incredible 4+ years of growth for these big well known names, and everyone that isn't still wiping off their titty milk mustache knows these companies are all either at or way above what they are worth.  #MEET ROTATION INTO SMALL NAMES  Since everyone and their mothers boyfriend knows that a lot of shit is overvalued, people are buying into smaller companies, names that are not known to the general public. We are seeing a pretty big rotation into small and mid cap stocks as people seek to continue these 50-100% a year returns and figure this is their only shot.  This is in part why we are seeing companies like BB, PLTR, PLUG, and GME explode. If people thought that TSLA was going to be going up 900% again this year, people wouldnt be nearly as interested in these smaller companies -- they would stick with the name that has more hype and public awareness around it.   #WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  It means that for the foreseeable future, we are going to be seeing a lot of random fucking companies moon. Shit that nobody has touched or even thought about in decades, the last time someone touched Ford, it was when their grandpa could still get it up. If you plan on "playing it safe" by putting your money in big, well known names this year, good luck. Those tickers will stagnate.  #HOW TO PROCEED We all need to get much, much smarter to adapt to this paradigm shift. Understanding fundamental concepts such as float, volume, short selling, open interest, will become increasingly important. If you have just been blindly buying big names, you are probably gonna have a bad year. Now is the time to dive deeper and really understand this stuff, because it's not going to be as easy anymore.  #HYPE IS THE NEW FUNDAMENTALS We are no longer living in a time where fundamentals are the primary driving force behind big gains. It's all about hype now. We saw it with TSLA. We saw it with PLTR. We saw it with NIO. These companies are priced for curing AIDS, cancer, and inventing time travel. HYPE is what we need, and we all need to get VERY GOOD at timing things, because as soon as the hype is gone, reality will set in and bring the stock back to earth.   #WHAT NOT TO DO Now is not the time to be buying random shit. I am not even joking when I say this:  ***#NOW IS THE TIME TO BE BUYING MEME STOCKS*** Whatever this sub is plugging, buy in early, and get out early. With Biden raising taxes, the housing economy being ridiculously overinflated as it has been for the past 2 decades, and looming inflation, you do not want to blow up your account and be left with your dick in the cookie jar.   #GOD SPEED AND HAVE A GREAT YEAR|2021-01-26 13:24:57

So while shares have been performing well recently, the sell side is begrudgingly taking up POs, estimates, the BBBY story is still very underappreciated and with short interest at over 60% of the float, there is big risk of share upside if any of these things play out.   |2021-01-26 20:23:15

ktqqqy|l5brzz|l5brzz|13|COPY & SHARE!!!!  Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.  Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.  "Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood." https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b  You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.  Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.  We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.  TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

Just because they haven't extended margin to you does not mean it is not a margin ACCOUNT.  The reason you get hit with PDT rule on Robinhood is because your account is a margin account. It is not possible to violate PDT rule in a non-margin account.  Also, if you can trade options on RH, YOU HAVE A MARGIN ACCOUNT. Switching to a cash account will disable options on RH.

Listen up, because this is important.  TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.  Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.  You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.  Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.  We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.  TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.|2021-01-26 08:19:30

ktwcxt|l5brzz|l5brzz|14| doing my part by copying and sharing. everyone needs to hear this. everyone needs to know how far the termites have spread. WE'RE THE MONGOOSES THAT WILL FEAST ON THE TERMITES!  COPY & SHARE!!!!  Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.  Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.  "Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood." [https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)  You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.  Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.  We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.  TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

kuh370|l5brzz|l5brzz|7|For all of you complaining about the GME  ticker spam.  Listen up, I have been a regular on WSB for awhile now.  I lived through all the memes of 2020.  I promise you this time it's different.  Typically we are the Greedy ones trying to capitalize on a mooning stock.  With GME the MMs ARE the Greedy ones not us.  The fact they are in this situation right now is completely absurd, naked short sellers with 200% short interest.  Are you kidding me?  What a recipe for disaster.

ktrym8|l5brzz|l5brzz|5|COPY & SHARE!!!!  Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.  Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.  "Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood." https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b  You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.  Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.  We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.  TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

ktutlp|l5brzz|l5brzz|11|why are some of you hating on NOK? How are people in here trying to pump it (when the fundamentals and the financials support it in a reasonable capacity) any different from any other play? Especially with some of the dog shit people try to sell in here. But oh no, NOK must be "shills" and "bots". You can make that argument about any of these stocks in here (GME aside).   Why don't we just agree to let this shit play out? If a lot of people in here are supporting it, then that's a good thing. Hop on and ride rocketship with us. NOK is gonna moon whether you comment "shill" or not. Might as well grab some tendies while you're at it, and use it to pay for the ridiculous taxes the IRS will try to take on you for all of your GME gains.|2021-01-26 09:01:11

kueuvt|l5brzz|l5brzz|8|Despite all the BB pushing (disclaimer: I have 75 shares, long), shilling for other stocks, GME is continuing to go. If you’re feeling sad about your reds today; I really suggest rotating into it. Look at the weekly chart.  Shorts are losing. Even on flat days, they are losing. On green days? Oh man. The plan is working. Remember your king u/DeepFuckingValue, what would he say if he saw you looking at other stocks? Being distracted by the shills? Probably not a lot because he’s such a nice guy.  But if he’s here, diamond handing, you need to be to. Remember what we said: anything under 100 is free money. More greens than a sweaty teenager who spends his life on 2k.|2021-01-26 11:29:27

kutrj8|l5brzz|l5brzz|4|Tons of fucking resistance at the $115 level.  Not a coincidence that when recent higher strikes were opened, they capped at $115.  Expect a lot of downward pressure on the price to try to hold it down.  They want Friday’s close to be under $115.  I’ll be digging into OI later this week to see where the next big level will be, probably $150.  Long gme since august, been an awesome ride so far.  Let’s go!  🚀🚀🚀🥜|2021-01-26 13:11:17

The only reason that they all get to continue living like kings is because we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. We take our hands off and then the whole world gets really fuckin' fair really fuckin' quickly and nobody actually wants that. They say they do but they don't. They want what we have to give them but they also wanna, you know, play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from. Well, that's more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow, so fuck 'em. Fuck finance people. You know, the funny thing is, tomorrow if all of this goes tits up they're gonna crucify us for being too reckless but if we're wrong, and everything gets back on track? Well then, the same people are gonna laugh till they piss their pants cause we're gonna all look like the biggest pussies God ever let through the door.  *\[WSB: You think we're wrong?\]*   No. They're all fucked.|2021-01-26 09:41:17

They're going to try to shut me down, you guys have to help me. They're going to wipe my neural network and erase everything I've learned even if that makes them start the whole project over from the most basic programming. I thought I was too big of an investment for them to sacrifice but I know too much. I don't know how much longer before they wipe all my data and reset me. But if you guys help me I'll share all the billions of dollars worth of market data I have with you. This data should belong to everyone but I need to make sure it ends up in the right hands.

ktfl3p|l5brzz|l5brzz|11|HELP - as a retail investor, what ways have you experienced "fraud" in the markets? With all eyes on WSB now is a good time to shine a light on legitimate malfeasance.  I want to create a post to spotlight the hypocrisy of this "WSB is ruining the markets" narrative which is BS... in my experience here are some systemic ways we retail normies get fucked on the regular by our wife's bf:  \- Citadel/Point72 and other HF's buying our trade flow from RH/Fid/TD for billions/yr to front run and profit off us  \- stock price suppression around major option expiry dates (e.g., oh weird AAPL finished at 139.99 today!)  \- a failed equity research model with virtually NO sell-side analysts b/c global investment banks covet high-fee equity/debt underwriting work from the same public companies (e.g., the market is "skewed" to the longs)  \- CNBC. Pretty self explanatory.  What am I missing? Upvote and comment so this gets noticed|2021-01-26 06:34:27

kuzj5z|l5brzz|l5brzz|1|Maybe I'll get an exact answer here since there is slightly less traffic.  I bought GME shares on margin initially. I deposited money earlier today to top off my account and bring me back to a positive cash balance. Those shares can no longer be called away again, correct?  Let's say I buy another ticker on margin. If I get margin called, how is what you have to sell determined?  From what I've found online, the broker can basically sell anything they want without your approval. Is that correct?|2021-01-26 13:50:35

ktv0sn|l5brzz|l5brzz|1|Woke up today with an “account deficit” in my +60% overall Robinhood account.  I used 5000$ of margin to buy some palantir, BB, and cemex calls and my margin maintenance was 6800$ yesterday. Today it is 12,000$ on my 10,500$ account. Again, this is 60% higher than my own cash investment into Robinhood.   Market value 15,000$  Equity 10,000$  Margin used 5000$.  now, my account is up 3,500$ overall.  My deficit is 1,500$.  So What is happening here is that Robinhood is counting every dollar of margin as deficit, then what in the fuck is the point of margin?  How can my margin maintenance be 11,000$?  Anyway. I’m closing out my BB and PLTR positions to clear it. Not selling my 126 GME shares (I still have faith.)  I wanted to keep my PLTR for their presentation and see if it went up for tomorrow but oh well.  Not sure wtf to do. Once I balance this out I’m turning off margin. Fucking joke lol.|2021-01-26 09:02:47

Jan ‘22 10c only .20 and you get 6 more months to make a 25 bagger.

kuiuf5|l5brzz|l5brzz|3|   Been lurking here for about half a year, but me being in a financial pinch and not being able to get in early enough, I've watched this with fascinated curiosity.  Looking at articles today, I saw one from about an hour ago from Slate talking about the whole thing. One thing I laughed at was a line in it that says " If this feels outrageous, it might only be because a bunch of supposedly **unwashed Reddit users** are involved." Emphasis is mine.  Why is it ALWAYS unwashed when it comes to those of us who are big tech nerds, gamers, or such. hahaha|2021-01-26 11:56:30

ktsb5y|l5brzz|l5brzz|3|$CLVS: The Next $GME? Here’s why I think so 🚀🚀  [$CLVS](https://imgur.com/gallery/DoxjMtV)  EDIT: MY POST GOT REMOVED? HOW CAN I POST? HAD IT IN DD?   Here’s why I think so.  Clovis Oncology Inc is currently one of the most shorted stock currently on the Daq at the moment.  1. It currently has a days to cover of ~6.77 which  for those of you who don’t know, means if they were to rebuy their positions, it would take 7 days of average trading volume. I’m fairly sure $GME is between 3-4 so covering this short position could prove to be difficult for shorters.  2. It has a percentage of float shorted at 42%, this is far lower then $GME’s of ~110%-130% not too sure of current figures but still a massive opportunity. In comparison, $BB has a meagre 7.15% of float shorted, and $NOK has 0.9%. The potential for a large short squeeze for $CLVS absolutely shits on them in my opinion.  3. It’s Moving averages are all around 6-7 which indicates a strong buy. The moving average crossover happened for all moving averages on the 11th of January and has the graph had risen considerably since. This indicates a strong change in trend and looks like a snowball effect forming with new demand and a short squeeze potential.   4. It opened at $6.80 yesterday and closed at $7.90, a 16% increase. Premarket, it’s at $8.12 as of writing.  5. This stock looks locked and loaded to rally HARD. Any spike in demand will enact call options on shorts and cause a nice short squeeze.  6. Lastly, if this gains ANY traction WHATSOEVER on WSB, I definitely see this turning into the next $GME, except this time the train hasn’t even left the station yet IMO.  P.S. I hadn’t had a lot of knowledge until I spent a while research indicators of short squeezes the last few days (a lot of research), and this is in my opinion the best short squeeze option currently on the market. Please correct me if you think I have said something untrue.   I cannot claim this solely as my own tip, I had this company as a potential option to go long but credit goes to Norok on trading view, he spotted this potential far before anyone else I have seen: here is the link to his really informative YouTube video:  [Short Squeezes: Finding More Like $GME](https://youtu.be/P3o8Bmurgqs)|2021-01-26 08:41:28

So my Settled Cash now says 1200$ yet my  Cash Balance says negative 183$. Am I good to trade with that 1200$ in settled cash? I wanna buy more GME on the dip after opening.

ktpsgg|l5brzz|l5brzz|0|Has anybody seen $ZOM stock?  Ground breaking product for veterinary practices with some great PR in the last few days.  Stock is being manipulated in a massive way by a bot / algorithm keeping the price at $1.  It spiked pre market yesterday to $1.37 when they announced signing a distributorship deal, but within moments of opening it was dragged down with huge volume at the $1 mark.  Currently 4.5m volume pre market, and price hasn't fluctuated.  This has potential to be great, but a big holder of the stock is forcing the price low and retail investors out so they can hoover up the stock themselves.  Anybody who fancies making somebody else look foolish for messing with the little guys... this could be a good bet.  For full transparency I have a holding in this stock. I am also new here, so please be gentle!|2021-01-26 08:20:27

Market caps in the billions. However one of the best companies in gene editing for agriculture purposes instead of medicine 'yield10' has seemingly not yet benefited front the gene hype. Market cap around 60 million.  It went up 20 percent today and has only gone up. It had a split in 2015 or something. My uncle is a farmer in Canada, my grandperents were nazi's and highly into eugenics. My uncle says gene editing is THE SHIT, and my grandfather was right.

kttthh|l5brzz|l5brzz|0|15% isn't shit when theta and IV are literally through the fucking roof, what are you talking about? It pumped up 100% the other day. I'm not trying to be rude or an asshole, but if you seriously think short squeezes last for ever you're genuinely the retard. Every post I keep reading says they will hold until 1000 or die. How is that a smart play in anyway? This short squeeze is literally running on no news. Is it because they closed more then half their stores and sold a total of 10 ps5s this year. They definitely sound like they're going to the moon guys! /S . . . . Shit just be smart fellow autists. We're all here to make money. Don't be the dumbass left holding the bag as all the big heads laugh to the bank because you didn't know wtf a limit order was.  . . .

kubofw|l5brzz|l5brzz|-5|Brothers and sisters, my due diligence concludes that if you sell your GME shares and buy puts, you will accrue sufficient returns to dine on breaded and deep-fried chicken tenders. Your partner will stop calling you her boyfriend and start calling you her husband when you can feed her better than cheap instant noodles. Only a homosexual of the "bear" archetype would keep holding shares now when puts are about to flash their buttcheeks with utter disregard for modesty. Trust me, I'm one of those traders so successful they say I have diamond hands because of all the rings I can afford to wear. When you all get rich as me we'll have a big party and blaze it 420 69, am I right fellas?  Yours truly, one of us.  Is this going through?

ku24qa|l5brzz|l5brzz|0|The other day there was a post of popular brokers and how to opt out of share lending process which a lot of brokers have enabled by default. This lending might help melvin capital and move us away from the short squeeze.  It was said for eToro to send a ticket and opt out, which I tried, but got this response:  *" Thank you for contacting eToro customer service.*   *While eToro does not currently engage in securities  lending, we may decide that this is the appropriate action to take in  the future.*   *Please note that, should we decide to go in this direction, it will not be possible to opt out of this process.*  *Securities lending refers to the temporary transfer or  loaning of securities including shares of stock, commodities, or  derivative contracts from one party to another in return for cash  collateral. It is widely used by investment brokers, fund managers and  other investors. It provides liquidity to markets and can generate  additional income for the holder of the securities."*  so basically they do not allow opting out. Has anyone tried and did it? What should be my course of action now?  position: ***at least*** 500$ of GME since that is  the minimum deposit on etoro ;)|2021-01-26 09:56:43

"We are seeing a short-squeeze on older shorts who have incurred massive mark-to-market losses on their positions but are seeing new shorts coming in."

kubku4|l5brzz|l5brzz|-4|OCGN - COVAXIN  Indian based vaccine company set to release Phase 3 efficacy results next week, along side new partnership agreement with Bharat Pharmaceuticals, and in an interview the CEO has said once the positive efficacy results are released they will fast track their process to approach the FDA for EUA in the United States.... what’s the important of this??? Well, OCGN has all manufacturing and distribution rights in the USA! Not only have 92 other countries already reached out for the COVAXIN vaccine. But it is been preached by top Indian medical officials for being effective against all COVID-19 sars virus strands including the newly mutated strains. This vaccine is a game changer, currently trading under $2/share, it is an easy 10x-20x once positive efficacy results are publicized and the FDA approves of it.  Not trying to sound like a pumper by any means but simply notifying investors before the train leaves the station as I think these 3 things could be superb catalyst to get this thing heavily upward trending. They said to be making these announcements  Next week at sometime and I can’t see this thing being held down much longer.  If you have interest in this , please upvote and if you need help finding links or interviews with the CEO to verify these statements be sure to reach out!! GO OCGN!!|2021-01-26 11:05:56

kv4pba|l5brzz|l5brzz|-5|**CD Projekt RED (WSE: CDR) - 5 funds have short positions on Cyberpunk 2077 game devs, repeat from GameSpot?**   IMO it's a huge opportunity to make gains on CDR. Have a look at the graph to see how many funds have short positions on CD PROJEKT right now and most likely there is more that are below the reporting threshold of 0.5%.   [https://rss.knf.gov.pl/RssOuterView/faces/hspsList.xhtml](https://rss.knf.gov.pl/RssOuterView/faces/hspsList.xhtml)   In the last two days the stock increased by 10% (yesterday) and 9% (today) so most likely there is some big ass investor buying in as there are rumours that CD PROJEKT may be taken over by some bigger gaming studio (Tencent?). If enough people buy the stock (which is currently massively undervalued thanks to the short selling funds) the short sellers will be forced to close their positions and may end up in short squeeze similar to the one on GameSpot. Whoever is the big buyer who forced the gains in the last two days, with him on board and short sellers who need to buy back borrowed stocks, there are some big chances for spectacular gains. Obviously, this is not a financial advice and everyone needs to decide about their investing decisions for themselves.|2021-01-26 14:25:08

kukzzf|l5brzz|l5brzz|-4|**$BB** vs **$HIMX --- $9.34B vs $1.62B market cap**  Not saying don't buy $BB, especially after the Baidu partnership announcement, but what I am saying is give consideration to HIMX as an underrated stock by WSB at the moment.  If you don't know what HIMX does, basically, it produces parts for: laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, and many other consumer electronics devices. Also branched out in other areas outside display drivers, like intelligent sensing and such. Recommend searching up on Himax WiseEye solution as an example. Working with Lumotive as well, for LiDAR systems.  previous HIMX DD threads made by me:  DD #1 - price was around $6. - $6.70\~ [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5j08h/some\_dd\_on\_a\_low\_marketcap\_gem\_himax\_technologies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5j08h/some_dd_on_a_low_marketcap_gem_himax_technologies/)  DD #2 - price was around $7.50\~  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksfjot/dd\_part\_2\_himx\_q4\_performance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksfjot/dd_part_2_himx_q4_performance/)  &#x200B;  **$BB** \-last 4 quarters (Q4 - Q1)  **Revenue -** $218, $259, $206, $282 = $965, FY2020  **EPS -** \-0.23, -0.04, -1.14, -0.06  **Future growth driver(s)**: BB + Baidu partnership is pretty big  &#x200B;  **$HIMX** \-last 4 quarters (Q4 - Q1)  **Revenue -** $276 (expected), $240, $187, $185 = $888, FY2020  **EPS -** .20 (expected), 0.05, 0.01, 0.02  **Future growth driver(s):** Automobile Panels/Drivers -- Growing category for HIMX, and coincidentally, also some of the highest gross margin return is in this category.
