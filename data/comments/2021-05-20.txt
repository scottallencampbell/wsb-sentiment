It used to be 90 days but over time as public pressure increased they slowly kept reducing the time from meeting to public disclosure.  One risk is speculators that take advantage of the lag, an argument for faster release.  So talk of bond-buying tapering was already in the works in April.

yujhaf|ngw4ld|ngw4ld|3|I'm really upset at myself for not making funds available to buy PTON when it fell to $82. I knew it would bounce back. It was the only time I have ever sure about a stock. I had all my money tied up in shit that is so embarrassing that I don't even want to talk about it. Ok it was MVIS and MNMD. I could be up thousands of dollars right now. I know that's chicken shit for most people in this sub but I'm not a high roller yet and that money could have gone a long way to making a portfolio that isn't pathetic. I'm actually depressed about it. I'm pretty new to trading and this is the first time I've felt like this about missing an opportunity and taking a loss. I guess it's an important lesson. Had to learn it at some point I suppose. I'm glad I have this experience now, but damn it hurts. Bad. Sorry for sounding like a puss, it's my least favorite quality when I see it in others and here I am doing it.  Welp, lesson learned. Now I know.|2021-05-20 12:46:36

yv04h9|ngw4ld|ngw4ld|3|been sideline-ing it through this whole elon/cathy/burry/shitcorn saga, but i'm looking over at TSLA and thinking it's time for puts. I think elon went a bridge too far investing TSLA in fake corn in an attempt to stay profitable, and yes teslas are great cars but TSLA isn't making much money. AAPL et al RAKE money in, and at this point in tesla's life, it should be at least 10% kinda margins, not a tax-credit-inflated 3%.

If you could blow 100k on the stock market you are practically part of the 1 percent you will recover. And think about it, they have 100k on the stock market alone, how much do they have in other assets like their house or car or how much do they get paid each year ot accumulate that much money? If they have 100k in their brokerage account they have a fuckton more laying around somewhere  I feel a lot worse for people blowing 15k or 20k because its obvious thats their life savings and they are most likely just trying to create a better life for themselves|2021-05-20 08:03:07

yti43m|ngw4ld|ngw4ld|5|I thought this place was for discussing stocks and our opinions, so Wallstbets I don't know if you're shorting GM but I am bullish Long on GM and here's my take:   I believe GM stock is undervalued by half at least. Usually a company like GM should be trading at a multiple, instead they are trading for half the market cap of total earnings. Not saying this is the only factor but is definitely there. The EV vehicle transitions followed by announcements, release dates, increased earnings, new jobs all could be leading factors why GM stock reaches $90.   My plays are as follow:   BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2022 x 10 contracts   BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2023 x 10 contracts   GM has the infastructure to support a massive takeover of EV, Tesla can barely deliver cars to people that ordered them 6 months ago. The market cap difference is $650 Billion. When GM siphons some of that market cap you can see GM stock trading anywhere from $150 to $300 making traders profits of anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million in profits. Check Options profit calculator for that option play and look at profit targets of $90 to $300. It will show what each option will be worth at each price level   SEE YOU GUYS AT THE BANK!|2021-05-20 08:20:52

UWM, which is short for United Wholesale Mortgage, rose to prominence earlier this year thanks to the r/WallStreetBets excitement. Traders bid it up in hopes of a huge short squeeze. This did not happen. In fact, UWMC stock has crashed. However, unlike many Reddit stocks, this one appears to be a fundamentally strong company trading at a compelling valuation.   #HA HA HA We run the stock market apparently 🤭|2021-05-20 08:58:10

yvjut0|ngw4ld|ngw4ld|1|I was watching a stock in Fidelity and in AH trading I saw a couple things I could not understand, me being a smooth-brained ape and all.   \- One stock was tooling along at about $243 and change and suddenly it dropped 13% just for about 30 seconds and then came back to where it was.   \- Another stock was sitting at $18 something and there was a bid out there for $8.75.   What my smooth brain cannot comprehend is why these things were happening.    \- Was I seeing a directed trade on the $243 stock at a discount?   \- Was the $8.75 bid just someone hoping to pick up a bargain if someone dropped some stocks in at "market price"?   It took a while, but it got me thinking...can a retard like me use similar techniques, and what platform would make it possible? Pretty sure if I put a limit buy in Fidelity it would just sit on it until the stock hit $8.75 and the would \*try\* to buy it. At that pint I kinda don't want it. No way to lose big at that price!|2021-05-20 17:08:47

yuvyrj|ngw4ld|ngw4ld|-6|Quick question. I am a dabbler and learning more but like my weed stocks. I know the US market is favored but can someone with more Idiocracy explain but not give advice on why such a positive merger is causing such a divide of driving this TLRY stock down? “Bulls want to see Tilray’s stock break up bullish from the symmetrical triangle and regain support of the 21-day EMA. If Tilray makes a bullish move, it has room to move up towards the $17.50 level. If its stock was able to break above that level with momentum, it could reach $20.80 before bumping into more resistance.  Bears want to see Tilray’s stock break down bearish from the triangle and lose support of the eight-day EMA. If the stock does break bearish from the triangle, it could fall down to meet support at the 200-day SMA but if that level didn’t hold, it could fall further toward $11.87.”|2021-05-20 14:14:11

yughh3|ngw4ld|ngw4ld|-5|So I tried making a topic on the ukinvesting and personalfinance forums but automod is being a bitch and won't let the fucking post go through so I figured I'd try asking here.     Serious advice only please.  &#x200B;  The sharesave scheme I'm in is being closed soon and I have the option of cashing it in or paying in for a further 6 months then cashing in.        I pay in to 3 separate 3 year schemes with varying amounts in them. These can each be cashed in soon or in 6 months separately, I can make an individual choice for each of them, they don't have to be all soon or all 6 months.        The shares we buy are Walmart shares.        On the one hand if I cash in now I'll get fewer shares but then if I cash in later I'll have more shares which would compensate for a small drop in the price if it does fall.  &#x200B;  Should I cash in now or later?|2021-05-20 12:25:55

yulf55|ngw4ld|ngw4ld|0|Can someone help me with a question? Let's say a stock is at 40 cents and needs to be at 1.00. let's say they were gonna reverse split meaning turn two shares to one consolidating shares to go to 1.00.   You have a call option at 50 cents or above to be in money. Let's say 1 year away.    Let's say to scenarios could play out.  1. What if price is at .40 goes to .55 and reverse split to 1.10. You own the strike price of .50 call option. Do you still buy 100 shares at 50 cents and then can double your money?  2. Let's say it goes to 30 cents and they have to do a 4 to 1 consolidation for the target compliance. They go to 1.20. does  this mean while the .50 call option is held? I still hold that strike? I understand after reverse split it could go down or up in value.  Can someone please help me understand so I can be a good investor.  If this shit is like magic the gathering it should hold 100 shares at the 50 strike price for a 50 percent gain I think.    3.|2021-05-20 13:00:02
