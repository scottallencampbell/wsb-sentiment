Inflation peaking isn't the end of the battle - this is the one key point the market appears to be raising the middle finger to. They need to get inflation down - they do not want inflation getting too sticky and becoming entrenched for the next decade.  Any deep dives to new lows will be on the back of a recession, if one transpires.

This is the all grown up and REAL version of 'magnets can cure...' the thing is tho that the electgrical field waves MUST have their wavelengths equal / relevant to the SIZE of the cell that's trying to divide. This isn't a problem except per-cancer - pretty much ALL cancer cells end up much bigger than normal cells.   The only thing this can't really be expected to treat is bloodborn cancers - lukemias basically - which it 'could' work with full body pads batteries just aren't there yet (would have to stay plugged in) and blood cancers the cells tumble around a lot - not giving the fields enough time to fatally impact the cells   The biology of NVCR is this and it checks out. when any eykaryotic cell divides the chromosomes first divide then 'aling' and condense along a central cell axis - then they get pulled apart and each daughter cell gets 1 set.   (or not divide - but replicate)   this is when NVCR's magnetic fields work. they tear rotate then tear apart the condensed chromosomes of any cells that are dividing.,   'if the wavelengths line up with the total cell size of the cell'   (IIRC it's actually like....some set ratio)   anyway   so yea they have a nice long patent on METHOD - no one else can touch this entire area of treatment for a damn long time   Furthermore it's well priced - at like 17k/mo in the USA (or 22k? shrug)   and you have to replace the pads etc - so they can keep charging it. The value proposition is this - NVCR is occasionally profitable NOW with a couple of TINY cancer markets/indications - they have 3 upcoming phase 3 trial readouts - 1 this year, 1 in q1 next year, 1 later next year.   EACH of those 3 cancer indications ON ITS OWN is 22X or more the market size of glioblastoma + methsolima   So you're looking at what BY ALL INDICATIONS is a near-garuenteed 66X on market size - talking multiple 15:1 stock splits and huuuuge dividends for YEARS if you get in now. To tell you exactly how de-risked these trials are - they had a futility study readout a year or so ago - the futility study said that FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS they should cut the placebo population in HALF and move those people over to the treatment arm... AKA the FDA fucking flat out SAID "your thing works and has no side effects - there's no reason to deny it to 50% of your placebo pateints and you'll get p" - theyt refused of course. About 2 years ago a hedge fund lent them about 250million cash at ZERO percent fixed interest for IIRC 3 or 5 years? With a dilution price of around 120$/shr IF they could not pay it all back in time.   "yea we'll pay a giant premium on your shares because we know this thing is going to work so PLEASE SPEND OUR MONEY"   That's NVCR "Novacure" in a nutshell.|2022-09-12 08:55:49o46ejq|xc8qn4|xc8qn4|-12|Just bought 3 shares of BBBY 😁|2022-09-12 07:40:38o47z1f|xc8qn4|xc8qn4|-12|Slava Russia.
