It was part of an internal strategy designed to mitigate dissatisfaction among employees, who have seen the overall value of their comp packages decrease b/c Shopify's poor stock performance this year.     However, those changes, which were to take effect this month - have been quietly pushed to at least Sept.|2022-07-26 08:14:30

hp9eoa|w8fqvo|w8fqvo|2|I just went all in on GAZ  Russia announced over the weekend they are going to cut national gas exports again to only 10% normal. This is in an effort to make it harder for European counties to re stock for winter.   Putin isn’t going to give up before spring, Europe is in for a long, expensive winter. And a last ditch move would be to cut the supply (40% European supply) during winter.  Also, look at wheat futures options last Friday when news of a export deal w Ukraine broke, futures dropped like Morgan Stanley in 08. So watch the war closely, and time those GAZ puts.   These next few months will be money in my opinion. Publicly the EU will stand arm in arm, privately they will all be buying as much as they can individually and create a sellers market worse than food futures since they can afford more.

Don't want to wait until tomorrow in case the Pump doesn't show up. I expect a hawkish fed, and the banks say they expect a hawkish fed. So maybe *everyone* expects a hawkish fed and the pump doesn't show.|2022-07-26 09:57:34

The current price is 9.50 / contract. Let’s say it goes above 10 a contact. After it goes above 10, I don’t want to sell the contract for less than 9.90. So if it goes below 9.90 I want to trigger a marker sell order. Now if it goes to 11 I want to trigger a sell order as well. Is there an order type for this? Or do I need to place a limit sell at 11 and a stop loss at 9.90 after it reaches 10? Thanks retards|2022-07-26 13:40:45

hq9ny8|w8fqvo|w8fqvo|-5|so interesting story, I was flying business into Washington yesterday, and JPow was in the seat next to me. I guess he was getting in a couple days early for the FOMC meeting.   Right after we took off he kept repeatedly pressing the call button for a flight attendant. Every time they came over he demanded they take the plane higher. When they told him the pilot decides the cruising altitude he loudly sighed and said “this shit’s rigged” under his breath.   As we went to land he undid his seatbelt and walked towards to the cockpit loudly yelling at the attendants to let him land the plane. He kept saying “he does this shit all the time”. When they told him he can’t do that he went back to his seat and put on his headphones. They must have been on full blast because I could hear him playing C.R.E.A.M by Wu Tang on repeat.|2022-07-26 11:00:06
