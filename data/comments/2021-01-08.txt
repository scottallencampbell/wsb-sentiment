ij92iv|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|8|Ahh these TSLA levels remind me of the first option I ever bought for TSLA last June. I believe TSLA had previously hit 1k and cooled down to 850-900.. I bought a 950c expiring in two weeks for less than 2k. After the first week Tesla had stayed pretty flat. I was up about 5% but my ADHD got the better of me and I wanted to buy Inovio options. The following week Tesla absolutely ripped to $1300. I had left over $30k on the table. All of this happened before I even started browsing WSB. Am I autistic? Have I always belonged here?

ijetdu|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|5|#FCEL DD from 10-Q filling   Product revenue:    Decreased revenue from covid shit down in Half of Q2 and Q3. Increased revenue cost in Q3 to expand and do repairs on plants. YoY they increased production from 2MW to 10MW. They expect to operate approximately 21MW during Q4.  Service and License Revenue:    YoY service and licensing revenue decreased from 11.5m to 7.1m YoY prior year revenues due to revenue recognized from  a deal with Exxon Mobil from royalties. The cost of revenue increased from 1.1m to 8.83m YoY. This cost was mostly from repairs and expansion of their Clearway energy plant which is expected to increase margins from higher production.  Generation Revenues:     Revenue decreased from 5.4m to 4.7m YoY due to decrease in production from temporary covid closure.  During this time frame cost of revenue rose from 5.7m to 6.3m. The decrease in revenue and increased cost of revenue is from the downtime and upgrades from their 14.9 MW Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project)  They had 32.6 MW of power plants in their portfolio as of July 31st 2020, compared to a 26.1MW portfolio. This increase is from the commencement of their Tulare BioMAT project in December 2019.   Advanced Technologies Contract Revenue:    ATC revenue increased from 5.76m to 6.89m YoY.  Cost of Revenue increased from 3.37m to 4.03m YoY  The increased ATC revenue is in connection to their joint deal with Exon and was recognize during the start of Q1 and the timing of other contracts.  As of July 31st 2020 their backlog increased to 51.9m from 27.2m YoY. The increase is primarily from their deal with Exon.  They also have been going through legal battles and decreased their expense YoY from 7.1m to 6.6m  Lowering R&D costs as well.  Idk IMO we could see a bullish uptrend in revenue. They have a pretty substantial list of backlogged projects for servicing customers 1 of them being Toyota. The services are expected to generate positive FCF over 20 years. Likely will pop with infrastructure plans.  Recognized competition from Plug Power, Ballard Power Systems and PEM (Pioneer Energy Management) IIRC correctly.|2021-01-08 07:33:18

If it gets anywhere close to in the money, you make a profit. The gap between the prices on $515 and the $520 strike prices for that expiration date is 22 cents per share, so if if SPY goes up by about 10% you nearly triple your money.

ikvak0|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|3|u/benjaminikuta, if you intend to sell your SPY leaps when it gets to double the price, set a limit order for it. This is so you get a fill on the off chance we have the market melt up like it did when they announced before it settled back down 15 minutes later.  And if you are afraid of missing out on those melt up days once it gets close to being doubled, adjust your limit price to whatever the close price is plus 30% once they are worth almost double.  Doing either would be a good idea since I couldn't even log it to *Schwab* during the first 15 minutes of that day. I doubt Robinhood would have loaded or you would have gotten off at the absolute top that day.|2021-01-08 14:25:36

So do you sell your deep-in-the-money calls to rebuy calls closer to the strike price? Or is that just playing with fire?  For example, I am lucky enough to have a deep-in-the-money TSLA call. However, I‚Äôm making less on this run then somebody who bought yesterday and is closer to the strike price. I‚Äôm not complaining, but would a real trader sell the current call and buy a new call?
