ijelem|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|15|For everyone getting nervous about the absurd green - just remember Monday. SPY dropped a full $10 and the dip was largely bought up by EOD. It then continued to blast new ATHs all week.  If people were getting nervous at these levels with their fingers on the sell trigger, the spy drop would have been the catalyst.  Nobody gives a fuck and all the fingers are on buy.  SPY 1/22 400c, TSLA 1/15 1000c  ....is what I would buy if I weren't a scared bitch. Hah!|2021-01-08 07:30:55

Why don’t you go join the literal thousands of other people who came to the same conclusion and either lost money shorting or missed out on gains.   Call it whatever you want, people have been doubting TSLA since day 1, but this shit doesn’t fucking stop.  Maybe you people are right. Maybe it will collapse eventually. But until then you’re wrong and just sound like salty losers.   I’m not even a TSLA holder, in fact I’ve lost money in totality on TSLA calls but there comes a point when it’s time to accept reality, buy calls, and stfu about fundamentals because it’s abundantly evident that people don’t give it a shit what the fundamentals are.

ij92iv|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|8|Ahh these TSLA levels remind me of the first option I ever bought for TSLA last June. I believe TSLA had previously hit 1k and cooled down to 850-900.. I bought a 950c expiring in two weeks for less than 2k. After the first week Tesla had stayed pretty flat. I was up about 5% but my ADHD got the better of me and I wanted to buy Inovio options. The following week Tesla absolutely ripped to $1300. I had left over $30k on the table. All of this happened before I even started browsing WSB. Am I autistic? Have I always belonged here? I love you guys. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.|2021-01-08 06:23:36

That gives Tesla a market value north of $1 trillion for the first time. Tesla now joins Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL).  - Some website|2021-01-08 10:09:23

Maybe it was McKenzie that was the smart one dropping that loser. Anyways I'm done being long, I would have made more money  in interest at the bank then investing in AMZN the last 6 months, just not sure if I should short Amazon or go long JD, or JMIA, or MELI...some 3rd world growing E-Commerce company.

ijetdu|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|5|#FCEL DD from 10-Q filling   Product revenue:    Decreased revenue from covid shit down in Half of Q2 and Q3. Increased revenue cost in Q3 to expand and do repairs on plants. YoY they increased production from 2MW to 10MW. They expect to operate approximately 21MW during Q4.  Service and License Revenue:    YoY service and licensing revenue decreased from 11.5m to 7.1m YoY prior year revenues due to revenue recognized from  a deal with Exxon Mobil from royalties. The cost of revenue increased from 1.1m to 8.83m YoY. This cost was mostly from repairs and expansion of their Clearway energy plant which is expected to increase margins from higher production.  Generation Revenues:     Revenue decreased from 5.4m to 4.7m YoY due to decrease in production from temporary covid closure.  During this time frame cost of revenue rose from 5.7m to 6.3m. The decrease in revenue and increased cost of revenue is from the downtime and upgrades from their 14.9 MW Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project)  They had 32.6 MW of power plants in their portfolio as of July 31st 2020, compared to a 26.1MW portfolio. This increase is from the commencement of their Tulare BioMAT project in December 2019.   Advanced Technologies Contract Revenue:    ATC revenue increased from 5.76m to 6.89m YoY.  Cost of Revenue increased from 3.37m to 4.03m YoY  The increased ATC revenue is in connection to their joint deal with Exon and was recognize during the start of Q1 and the timing of other contracts.  As of July 31st 2020 their backlog increased to 51.9m from 27.2m YoY. The increase is primarily from their deal with Exon.  They also have been going through legal battles and decreased their expense YoY from 7.1m to 6.6m  Lowering R&D costs as well.  Idk IMO we could see a bullish uptrend in revenue. They have a pretty substantial list of backlogged projects for servicing customers 1 of them being Toyota. The services are expected to generate positive FCF over 20 years. Likely will pop with infrastructure plans.  Recognized competition from Plug Power, Ballard Power Systems and PEM (Pioneer Energy Management) IIRC correctly.|2021-01-08 07:33:18

Dont just pile in at 850 thinking it can only go up. One day (who knows when) it will pull back.

ije808|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|3|“We know that tax rates are likely going up,” Wiener told me. “The question is, will it be 2021 or 2022?  I don’t think individual tax rates are the bigger concern, I think corporate tax rates and capital gains are going to be the main focus.” Wiener believes that major tax changes are unlikely in 2021:  “It’s very unlikely they will try to force a big corporate tax hike this year.”  Subramanian, citing other sources, also said she expects tax changes to come in 2022 rather than 2021 as the Democrats  focus on fiscal stimulus first and tax increases second.  This is the year to blow it out of the water. Make life changing money and then kick back on the beach in Vietnam or Thailand for the rest of your life.|2021-01-08 07:26:54

ik98bi|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|3|Here's my stupid idea for a SPY call spread:  Buy SEP 2022 $555 for $1.19  Sell SEP 2022 $560 for $1.11  You spend $8 per contract for a debit spread and make money when the gap in the price between these two options grows. If it gets anywhere close to in the money, you make a profit. The gap between the prices on $515 and the $520 strike prices for that expiration date is 22 cents per share, so if if SPY goes up by about 10% you nearly triple your money.  Clearly this would be inefficient with a *really* big stake, but do you think it would work as something to do just while fucking around with $20 for the fun of it?|2021-01-08 11:45:01

ikvak0|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|3|u/benjaminikuta, if you intend to sell your SPY leaps when it gets to double the price, set a limit order for it. This is so you get a fill on the off chance we have the market melt up like it did when they announced before it settled back down 15 minutes later.  And if you are afraid of missing out on those melt up days once it gets close to being doubled, adjust your limit price to whatever the close price is plus 30% once they are worth almost double.  Doing either would be a good idea since I couldn't even log it to *Schwab* during the first 15 minutes of that day. I doubt Robinhood would have loaded or you would have gotten off at the absolute top that day.|2021-01-08 14:25:36

TSLA has been adding 20-50 Billion to it's market cap each day for the last two weeks, it's within spitting distance of being a trillion dollar company.      Meanwhile, GME has been hyped up like no other on WSB for a month and a half now, and in that time has added only around 350 million to it's market cap.

It's not a post-Steve Jobs Apple presentation, where updates are leaked beforehand and priced in. We're talking a William Li pump day. Assess downside-vs upside risks. Your brokerages will reveal some news over the weekend, probably, but even more heavily on Monday, when the big money managers "officially" work.|2021-01-08 10:42:11

ijqnob|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|2|Dumb question about options strategy for you all: If you are deep in the money they you lose delta. So do you sell your deep-in-the-money calls to rebuy calls closer to the strike price? Or is that just playing with fire?  For example, I am lucky enough to have a deep-in-the-money TSLA call. However, I’m making less on this run then somebody who bought yesterday and is closer to the strike price. I’m not complaining, but would a real trader sell the current call and buy a new call?  Hope that makes sense. Thanks for any advice here.|2021-01-08 09:22:50

And  https://mobile.twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1347621689249689600   > As Manchin’s office tells it, his “absolutely not” quote was meant as a response to whether $2,000 checks should be the #1 priority now; he’s not with Schumer on that part, but doesn’t promise to vote against more direct cash either.   What a dumb smoke screen.  It's entire a ploy to get WV more money.  Before, there were also 5-7 GOP senators who wanted to support much bigger stimulus, but mcconnell didn't bring it up for a vote. Now mcconnell cant block it. Even if Manchin wanted to vote no, all that'd be needed is one GOP vote to replace Manchin's.|2021-01-08 13:33:49

ij4ww6|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|0|LONDON (Reuters) - Investors stormed into money markets and gold funds in the past week as exuberance towards equities faded slightly, BofA’s weekly flow show stats showed on Friday.  Cash funds saw $29.1 billion inflows and gold attracted $1.5 billion, marking the largest inflow since August in the week to Wednesday, the U.S. investment bank said.  BofA said the 2020 “winning flow trends” trickled into 2021 and recommended selling equities on the back of “frothy prices” and greedy positioning”.  “Sell the Vaccine: frothy prices, greedy positioning, inflationary and desperate policy makers, peaky China and consumer all ultimately toxic brew in 2021,” said Michael Hartnett, BofA’s chief investment strategist.  <runs for cover>|2021-01-08 05:20:29

ikfyvy|kt0a9h|kt0a9h|-1|Atlas Air (AAWW) is down 10% this week....and their contracts usually have no volume or  maybe one or two contracts trade a day. 131 contracts have been bought today (With more buying pressure then selling pressure) for 9% otm calls that expire next month. Atlas fell on news that amazon bought planes and they did not determine if their contractor to operate them would be atlas or ATSG. Not bad news, but rather uncertainty for investors. Check out my DD post on Atlas if you want more details. But I just picked up a **AAWW Feb 19th 55c** for easy money hopefully. DCF models and anaylsts show this stock being worth at least $81 so it is certainly a value play.|2021-01-08 12:33:47
