But there are different figures here to examine.  On August 30, the *total* put/call ratio was 1.25 and *Index* put/call ratio of 1.83 would suggest calls is the right move at this point.  BUT the *equity* put/call ratio was only 0.68.... is this the more accurate indicator because it leaves out the puts that are just hedges?|2019-09-03 09:23:35

ywb7il|cz3d4f|cz3d4f|5|Just an FYI:  PSA - 9/3 Tuesday  $52Bn Liquidity withdrawn premarket by US Treasury $28-34Bn liquidity returns midday (also from US Treasury)  $6Bn Liquidity taken away by GSE midday (80% chance)   When these events happen - typically the removal of liquidity coincides with weakness in SPY/SPX and when the liquidity is added back it coincides with buying. These sorts of liquidity moves are typically associated with the ol’ V shaped recovery.  Today the market is just messy, but I wouldn’t bet on it drilling this afternoon without a negative catalyst.|2019-09-03 10:42:51

yw5tl1|cz3d4f|cz3d4f|3|Not that anyone here watches the price of Silver closely or anything. Traditionally it has been a terrible store of value over the last 5 years. However, just in the last month, things are really taking off.   A few things that make this important. People are still worried about a global recession and bond prices are overpriced. Typically when there are market scares, people seek safety in Treasury bonds, or really just any bonds in general. But now the prices of bonds are too damn high. Who will pay $11,200 for a bond where they will be paid exactly $10,000 in 3 years with some menial coupon payments thrown in every 6 months? When that bond was priced at $10,600 it probably made sense, but at these high bond prices, people will seek alternative investments. Yields are getting pushed through the floor and bond prices have a definite ceiling, but some investments like Gold and Silver have no ceiling. Some companies like AT&T are cleaning up their balance sheets by paying down debt. Still others are reissuing bonds with lower coupon rates and paying down their high interest bonds. Some companies fear issuing new debt if we are headed into a recession.   Most companies are in good financial shape, most cities/municipalities are good financially, and even the American household is pretty good historically speaking. We might be at the tipping point for a manufactured recession, but I still think there is too much money floating around. Access to credit markets is still there and there is still some semblance of demand from the consumer.   I guess throw your money in SLV and GLD until we hit peak recession fears, because bonds are too damn high, and stocks are uncertain.|2019-09-03 09:40:35

So depending on what happens the 18th (and prior to that, what Fed members hint at) will determine market direction. I think if we get a .25 cut that won't be good enough for us to go above 300, but if we get .50 we'll break 300.
