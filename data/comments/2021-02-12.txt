If OPEN and GSAT go up within the next week I’ll still have life, but doubtful. Will be saving up to recoup my losses over the next few months. Will NOT be investing (aside from my 401k). It was fun, but not really. Thanks for the autistic advice along the way. I’ll still be around this sub reading. Good luck|2021-02-12 08:10:18

n37wk2|li8ul6|li8ul6|20|Holy shit just read some of Palantir's actual S-1 filing. Their governance structure is absolute bonkers. They created special "Class F" shares for the founders, such that the total of all class F shares at all times have 49.99999% of the voting power of all outstanding shares. That means the Founders can sell their shares without losing any voting power, and they can issue brand new shares as much as they want and Thiel, Cohen and Karp will always maintain full control.   > Accordingly, our Founders will be able to achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings without diminishing their voting control.  They just crafted a way to get listed on the stock exchange while remaining privately controlled. What was the point of the DPO then? Just make employees happy?

When you see everyone spamming the same ticker, it’s time to GET OUT. That means we’ve reached the peak.   What you want to do is find an undervalued stock (not something someone says on WSB), buy into it cheap, hold until it gets hyped, and THEN SELL when you start seeing rocket emojis next to its name every other comment. That’s how you make money.   That or buy puts on any stock WSB is skyrocketing. All of you buying into a stock when it’s already up 200%, what do you expect? That it’ll go up another 200% just for you? Don’t be a fool. Diamond hands is something people tell you so you hold while they sell and make money off you. This isn’t a team game.

There’s basically no point for the middle man in this business anymore.  Essentially they’ll only survive off manipulation and dishonesty because otherwise they’ll probably lose to the S&P.

At the same time, every stock dumps after earnings no matter how good/bad because of the same gamma pump into earnings and IV crush post earnings.   Like at this point the market is just following the options right?  Edit to expand: Are we not the market makers then? We’re buying so many options, taking advantage of significant leverage that we are literally moving markets, by forcing hedging on calls.|2021-02-12 10:04:38

TSLA is already light years ahead of NIO in terms of driving data, will literally take NIO more than a decade to get the same data that TSLA has RIGHT NOW...and in 10 years TSLA will legit have just a stupid amount of data about 10,000 times more data than NIO. Not only that but NIO/Ford/GM just cannot compete with TSLA in terms of robotaxi/automated driving, they'd have to partner up with NVDA to even come CLOSE to TSLA (NVDA's AI is 3 years behind TSLA's) so even then they'd be three years behind TSLA and will have to pay extra money for NVDA's partnership which will decrease their margins or make the cars far more expensive while also not being on par with TSLA.  &#x200B;  Car companies are playing catch up to TSLA's FIRST ITERATION....And I'm not even including batteries and solar......TSLA is undervalued at these prices someone fight me.|2021-02-12 16:37:27

It's been holding \~50 for the past week, so I think we found a bottom. Volume has been drastically low today and yesterday (\~12M by end of day). I'm hoping RC is cooking up a good PR which can bring this to 60 pretty easy. If you want some easy 10% gains, might be a good play IMO.

n28dl2|li8ul6|li8ul6|17|Alright newbies, this is your first opportunity. You know all those screenshots of +20000% options making people into millionaires? Those options are bought on days like today. You guys who joined in the last month or so have only had days of chasing other people's trades, and have been left holding the bag. These are the days where you stake your claim. Somewhere out there, there are companies having -5% days with call prices dirt cheap. Some of those companies will double in value over the next few months. Your job today is to get out there and identify those companies. Then you can leave the next generation holding your bags while you cash out your calls 4 months from now and buy a yacht just in time for summer.|2021-02-12 08:37:34

n36czv|li8ul6|li8ul6|10|WSB has indeed been taken over by memers with little to no knowledge - probably trust fund kids who have no idea how to live.   If you are a normal person, not here to yeet money into the dark, listen up.  SPCE went up 11% yesterday due to a flight schedule being confirmed  Flight schedule was delayed today, stock plummeted 11%  WITHOUT A SCHEDULED FLIGHT, it has risen back up to 56$. This is because for SPCE,  56 is around the floor right now for buys, where there is a sell limit ceiling at 60$.  There is a good chance they fly the plane sunday. They have already cleared airspace for both days. Maybe they wait till mid week. Maybe you miss buying SPCE while it is at the 56-54$ floor, and you watch as it raises to 100 on a successful launch. THE FLIGHT WOULDNT HAVE BEEN DELAYED, NOR WOULD IT BE A MANNED FLIGHT, IF THEY WEREN'T POSITIVE IT WOULD GO WELL.   Decembers flight DID NOT EXPLODE. It failed to communicate to ground, and SUCCESSFULLY LANDED BACK AT BASE. This bird will fly, and Branson is a fucking genius that doesn't play memelord like Elon does. Stop listening to the pack of money losing dimwit cunts and start doing research on real future stocks. SPCE will be a 1000-3000$ stock 20-30 years from now. Calls @ 56 for june are GOOD PLAYS RIGHT NOW FOR QUICK MONEY. This is a LONG TERM STOCK that you can ALSO daytrade at profit every day. Buy now before you FOMO. This is not financial advice, I am just a humble Ape who likes to help people. If you had listened to me yesterday at 10 AM and sold at 4 PM you would have made 11% profit.|2021-02-12 12:50:49

n1pmxs|li8ul6|li8ul6|9|Would you let your kids watch a version of The Big Lebowski where it's all re-shot with talking dogs and uses the original censored version of the audio from the original movie but with some dog related dubbing?  The Dude is now a pug voiced by Jeff Bridges with lines like "yeah, well that's just, like, your opinion, man."  The wheelchair Lebowski is now a bulldog with a doggie wheelchair who says "the pugs lost, Mr. Lebowski. The pugs will always lose!"  His assistant, Brandt, is a golden retriever.   The Dude's best friend Walter is a dachsund voiced by John Goodman with lines like "this is what happens when you find a stranger in the alps!"  Donny is a cat voiced by Steve Buscemi. He is out of his element.   Bunny, the runaway wife, is a poodle.  The Jesus is an Afghan hound.  Malibu's police chihuahua throws a mug at the dude's head.  A human cab driver who is barely willing to tolerate having dogs as passengers in this crazy talking dog filled world he lives in throws a pug out of his car for talking shit about his taste in music. Likewise, the human bowling shoe seller remembers when he sold bowling shoes to humans to wear, not to dogs who just chew on them and still fuck up the hardwood. Adult nerds on the internet can speculate about why this world seems dominated by dogs and humans only appear in service positions.   Dogs are bad at bowling but still do it and sometimes get really lucky and oddly kinda skilled. This should win the director an Oscar for running a production that involved training dogs to bowl. I'm hoping this will be a good family friendly remake of the Big Lebowski.   TLDR - just answer first paragraph then.

n1qc8c|li8ul6|li8ul6|10|*The most retarded DD you have ever seen*  Reasons to buy T leaps/shares.  1. Its HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated). It’s quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings.  If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride.  2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real shit; unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch.  3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it’s mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).  4. It’s not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.  5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.  6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining. One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.  Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.  7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.  8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.  9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.  Reasons not to buy leaps/shares.  1. It’s a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some fancy FCF predictions which are absolutely retarded. That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividends, the stock would have to remain connected to reality.  2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.  3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am retarded.  4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.  5. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it’s negative or not, but it probably isn’t much.  *That's all.*  I think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play.|2021-02-12 05:16:06

But I assume Intel would be picked, or Qualcomm, especially since they’re saying “they’d like to bring US manufacturing back” in the event of a contract being awarded to address this shortage.

After waking from my trance I received a package I DID NOT ORDER. My friends, deep within was a single blackberry, and from it bloomed many more. The package was filled with phones!

Guys do research when investing in a stock.  SNDL is garbage company producing garbage weed. Even if congress passes legal weed this company would most likely go under due to competition.  AMC is about where it should be (minus a squeeze? Lol) invest long term is not a bad deal but expect that money to sit for 6-10 months before it hits $7?  Look into companies who are innovative! Virgin space $SPCE was recently downgraded and dropped 10%. This is a solid company with long term potential and a 10% swing is a good opportunity?   Look at the news. Rite Aid was a re-emerging pharmacy who just grabbed a piece of the covid vaccine pie, and has an earnings report for fiscal year in april. Price just dropped because of a mis-reported stat in WSJ.

n1wook|li8ul6|li8ul6|11|If you're playing the chip shortage you gotta have a basic understanding of how chips are made and what each company does. You have chip designers, manufacturers, and suppliers.  The best positioned will be the suppliers and the manufacturers.  TSM is the manufacturer everyone knows, but you gotta understand how a chip is made. TSM still  requires supplies for things like chemicals for vapor deposition and photo resist, machines needed for photolithography, etc. Etc.  Target the companies that make machines for manufacturing and the suppliers of materials that TSM needs.  LRCX, AMAT, KLAC are some examples.  My personal favorite is applied materials, which constantly beats earnings, had a record backlog of orders last quarter, and looks like it'll get even more business with the shortage.  Applied Materials is a key supplier of equipment to TSM. TSM also committed to spending billions of dollars on capital upgrades. Who do you think they'll be buying machines from to address the shortage? Applied materials.  Also, TSM is opening up a new factory in Arizona that'll likely need new capital equipment to get up and running. Applied materials is right next door in CA.   Finally, did you  see the apple news? Apple id partnering with TSM to make oled displays.  Guess who got into the digital screen market and who has products for manufacturing OLED displays?  Applied materials again.  For a while, the foray into digital screens hasn't been a smashing success for AMAT, which some bears nitpicked on, but it's very possible now that the Apple-TSM deal will rub off on Amat because TSM buys a ton of Amat products.   Imagine how bullish the upcoming forward guidance may be for AMAT during the next ER. It could be monstrous due to the shortage and if there are some easter eggs in the display division that may be changing course from a laggard to a highly in demand area, the response from the market may be outstanding.  But just based on last ER from AMAT, I'd expect this upcoming ER to be a smashing success. Hell, we may even get lucky with a raised dividend because they have so much cash.|2021-02-12 06:43:09

I was only up a few dollars on them yesterday at close so I didn’t sell and thought if anything happens from me holding them on Friday worst case I learn a cheap $26 lesson to save my self in the future.

n32jek|li8ul6|li8ul6|6|So think of buying highs like coming to a basketball game late. Super exciting game. Thrilling. Game of the generation. Finals. Game 7.  You walk up to the door and they want to sell you tickets at full retail. Heck, it’s a scalper and he’s the doorman too. And wants to charge you more because of how great the game is. Double price.   You’re literally praying for overtime. And if you don’t get it and the game is over you wasted money, and just get to say “I was there” but don’t get anything for your money.   Would you ever do that? No. So stop buying highs.|2021-02-12 12:23:09

Whether you are an old school gamer who finished every faction in Skyrim, or a new school Gamer who has the Max Level Roblox badge, gamers know how to stick to a mission. We get sh*t done. You think we can't stomach a loss? How do you think we survived highschool watching every Stacy whore herself to that dick, Chad? You think threatening us with the law deters us? We are on our 4th PSN account after being banned for saying the n-word. Gamers have defeated the Nazis in Wolfenstein, defended the world from Alduin, lived through zombie apocalypses, gritted through the elite 4, and we still come back for more.

Everyone thinks you have to buy expensive ITM options to limit downside but that’s bullshit.  Think about it, the most you can lose on a play is 100% of your investment. The most you can gain is infinite. THERE IS LITERALLY INFINITE UPSIDE ON ANY CALL OPTION. Spread out your money and pick your plays. Look for low IV with lots of time left on it. The odds are actually always in your favor if you play like that.|2021-02-12 14:21:48

I then get a mysterious email from some dude named Santiago threatening me to leave her alone and I learn she used to be a Colombian pornstar involved with some bad dudes in the drug trade. She comes over starts crying and rubbing my cock which btw is now 💎 in dream and real life. She apologizes deeply and says I’ve always known how you felt about me I want to make it up to you. She smiles, stops crying, and starts to unzip my pants and that’s when..  My alarm goes off, the market is red as fck and my boner turtles so hard McConnell wants to study my tactics.

n3j7og|li8ul6|li8ul6|3|So about a month ago I was gonna buy SNDL.  The reason I didn't was the comments from a weed subreddit talking about weed stocks.  What they said was that the SNDL weed product sucked.  So I didn't buy, got upset when it mooned but now it's back down.  I'm gonna have to find and thank that post for helping me avoid fomo and buying at top. Also gonna throw in there that when a stock moves sideways for a long time, its a major deterrent to me.

n3k6fx|li8ul6|li8ul6|3|I truly believe PLTR was not ready to jump from mid twenties to 45 at the time it did. I think that was purely an effect of it being grouped in with the GME stocks.   So if you take that out, this is where we would (and probably should) have been around leading up to earnings.

n39svj|li8ul6|li8ul6|10|Time for a rant :  Fucking boomers of the other sub always trying to time the market and constant “bubble” whispers. Fucking pussies. It doesn’t make you a genius if you keep calling for a crash and it eventually appears 2-3 years or even 10 years later.  These idiots think that sitting on inflationary shitfedcoin makes them a genius when even an index fund is ripping 18-20%. Yes it will crash eventually, I don’t know when and I don’t know how much. I don’t think it’s going to be 0 no matter what pos index fund or company I invest in. Yes there is risk if you are leveraged otherwise not.  If you had listened to these idiots in march 2020, you would have missed the greatest bull stretch in last 10 years. There is argument to be made that equities were suppressed hard from 2013-17 but again that’s hindsight. If you had just stayed invested since March 2020, you are more than covered for the big crash coming whenever.  Anyone with half a nut for a brain knows that fed is printing money like crazy and there’s literally nowhere else for that money to go. Is it sustainable no fuck no! But what’s the point of fear-mongering? To make yourself feel better. Suck a d*  TL;DR : 💎 🙌, don’t go crazy on margins and PLTR 🚀 🚀 🚀|2021-02-12 13:16:26

You do the math 3. If Bumble ever were to get Cardi B as a spokesperson for Bumble it's over. Cardi B. B. Bumble. Bumblebee. $$$$$$$$$$$$ 4. Online dating during a pandemic. 5.

n36n1c|li8ul6|li8ul6|7|\*\*PSA for QQQJ\*\*  I know a lot of you have got burned chasing meme stocks (GME, PLTR, AMC and weed) and you're looking for something "safer" to play now. Well, look no further than call options on QQQJ. It is attractive because:  1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in big Tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.  2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside in QQQJ than QQQ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.  3) For options (the reason why 99% of you are reading this anyway), IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF that has gone up 30% since November with IV in the 25-30% region. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN, MJ etc have all gone up higher but check their IV and premiums.  4) My favorite reason for being in QQQJ: it is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too much and on hulk-dick green days, it doesn't rocket like ARKK. It just reliably goes up gradually.     I predicted in December than QQQJ will hit $35 by March and bought a lot of June $35c options. My thesis was that once the constituent companies in the ET reported good, in some cases blowout earnings and provide optimistic guidance for the upcoming year (due to the vaccine ramp up and an actual competent administration), it should rocket up. However, looking at its current trajectory, it will hit $35 and surpass it by next week!!  Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice day and make lots of tendies, brothers and sisters!     My recommendation: Get options expiring in June and September with strike price between $35 and $40. Park your money there, delete Robinhood and check back in 3 months.|2021-02-12 12:52:45

n1pxop|li8ul6|li8ul6|14|Don't get lost in all the pump & dump FOMO: Weed is a thing for 2021, from a buy and hold perspective. Just listen to Democrats talk about criminal justice reform and not one of them forgetting the weed decriminalization effort. Congress is split, but Republicans from legal-weed states are aware that US public opinion is 70% in favor of decrim.  &#x200B;  My time framework is:  First 100 days of Biden/Kamala - a bill of criminal justice reform being presented (mostly by Kamala initiative), trying to grant access to banking for all the weed stocks in the US and pushing for federal decriminalization (which is harder, and will probably fail);  Until the end of 2021 - bill is passed in a minimalistic framework (so, probably no money to rehab districts that have drug-related issues, but with the federal requalification of control substance status.  &#x200B;  If you ignore the whole Tilray's pump and dump, you see that weed, as a whole, has a huge upside since most of the price movements will happen in the weeks where rumours of this reforms appear.|2021-02-12 05:09:52

n2nfyp|li8ul6|li8ul6|5|From doing the most I could do by researching the shit out of AMC and BB with technical analysis because lets be honest, I just can't trust you fuckfaces to know what is actually going on. They both seem to have a breakout pattern forming around their MA's.. and maybe need slightly more volume to get those pumps.    \- AMC has a “wedge breakout” pattern forming with their respective SMA’s and MA’s. Basically, the highs from January are trying to break the lows and then converging to a pump. Think about it like a rollercoaster going up and down its peaks and valleys but continuously goes down, slight peak and down and then is slowing down a valley but getting held back without enough force to get to the next peak (like you trying to finger your girlfriends until she comes but you realize you’re in her ass instead). The area if people want to buy more in should be around $5 area to get it to pump to at least $20-18/a share. Plus, statewide theater reopening’s will bring in more revenue for some value in the stock.   \- BB has something similar going on, with more focus on the breakout coming through the middle of the $15.50 area. The VWAP was high this morning because of news on your mom's car Hyndai and that generated more volume from institutional buyers. But fuck those “institutional buyers” and fuck Jim Cramer. BB has legitimate value in terms of going long but if you really focus on the breakout of the MA VWAP cross pattern that’s forming it could pump to the $32-29 area. You could essentially skim a few shares off the top and keep 50 to 100 for long term profit.  We need more volume buys, can one of you guys troll Chamath into placing enough call orders in to pump the stock up more. There’s money under the table and on top of the table that could be easily grabbed.   Also FUCK CNBC and FUCK Jim Cramer|2021-02-12 10:34:43

All the OG weed bag holders from the 2017-2018 hype have relived there bags and now many of you have become the new bag holders. That being said, once legalization happens there will be another hype train but that may take a year or 2 so quick trying to pump those stocks. I own many different weed stocks, but I am investing and swing trading for the big payday of legalization. Most of the stocks that are good investments are MSO but they only trade on OTC.

n2cl56|li8ul6|li8ul6|3|# TDC put in a floor at $47, upside to this week's high of $59.50 and $70+ beyond that  # Original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfulsm/tdc_deeper_dd_as_promised/).  TLDR; Teradata is a data warehousing leader in direct competition with Snowflake. Last week's earnings show TDC's cloud business growing at 165% in 2020; CEO even suggested that they won business back from Snowflake.  We know the legacy business is worth $3 billion. TDC was a $3 billion stock before management broke out the cloud revenues last week.  **Price Targets**  $47 per share or $5.1 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 20x sales)  $66 per share or $7.2 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $4.2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 40x sales)  $76 per share or $8.3 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $5.3 billion (TDC Cloud @ 60x sales)  $105 per share or $11.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $8.5 billion (TDC Cloud @ 80x sales)  $125 per share or $13.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $10.6 billion (TDC Cloud @ 100x sales)  $190 per share or $21 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $18 billion (TDC Cloud @ 170x sales)  Compare that to other somewhat related cloud stocks: SNOW (170x), MDB (43x), FSLY (50x), DDOG (60x).  If Teradata Cloud successfully catches up to Snowflake, and is valued at the same P/S as Snowflake, it would be an $800 stock.|2021-02-12 09:11:32

Figured I was too late for the gme move, so I put money into weed stocks instead, because I think they’re good long term holds. Then y’all pumped the hell out of them, so I sold at the top and bought back in late yesterday after they crashed. I also figured out how to set limits and trade options yesterday. Up over 1,800 right now after two weeks of messing with this stuff. Small potatoes I know, but starting to understand it a bit more and looking forward to where this is heading. Good times!|2021-02-12 10:27:05

I think it's the far less risky play than investing in micron or Intel since they don't have to worry as much about supply and demand. Any thoughts on this?|2021-02-12 05:50:55

n1xtke|li8ul6|li8ul6|6|I saw Michael Burry at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.   He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.   The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.   When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.|2021-02-12 06:56:32

n2j16i|li8ul6|li8ul6|4|Amicus Therapeutics $FOLD :  I like this stock TODAY  !  &#x200B;  I consider myself a "value buyer" of stock.  I have the best results when I buy companies that have been beaten down.  I'm currently up 87% on GE, of all things.  I'm going to start commenting here about stocks that I like, because... why not?  &#x200B;  Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD) is down 33% today as of about 10:45 AM, and has hit its 26-week low.  The drop appears to be the result of a product candidate phase 3 study that reported difficult-to-understand but positive results.  I believe this stock fell to unreasonably low prices due to a sell-on-news selloff followed by a selling-begets-selling selloff and a stop-loss selloff.  In my opinion it is currently very undervalued.  I had never heard of $FOLD before this morning, but I bought it this morning after some quick research.  Anyone with $FOLD opinions to add?|2021-02-12 10:01:27

n1sla8|li8ul6|li8ul6|3|Friendly reminder to can’t posters. This is not a pump and dump discord (I could direct you that way)  *we are retards. We don’t move entire sectors on the coattails of an apparent paradigm shift driven by media. If you bought gunfile at 3.45 or fillgay at 73, you belong here, but the precedence is wrong. GME, BB, AMC were cultural outliers. The latter two are still bullish and still make sense given hype and fundies*  I am gay and this is not financial advice  Edit: gme is not necessarily bearish even at this valuation, but you have no reason to believe so on fundamentals alone.

They recycle electric vehicle batteries in an environmentally safe manner, which is going to boom over the next few years and the new plant will be the biggest in the US.

There’s just gonna be this random day, likely next week, of a complete dump that leads to an even bigger dump by open and a straight up massacre. Yes, money will begin pouring back in then but there’s just no buyers up here. I honestly feel like all volume today is algos...|2021-02-12 10:04:29

n2ppnz|li8ul6|li8ul6|2|Someone tell me what I’m missing with this play or why it’s a bad idea.   So let’s say I buy a deep ITM spy 2023 leap. Say $200. With spy at $390 it costs about 19k.  Say I also buy an ATM SPY $390 put leap for 2022. Say it costs 3.5k.   Between 200 and 390 my net loss exposure is 3.5k. Below 200 and above 425 is profit.   So net risk is 3.5k and net investment is 22.5k. Upside is unlimited.   Comparatively if I buy 100 SPY at $390. My risk of loss is unlimited to the downside. And my upside gain potential is like $1000-$2000 more if I hold the stock versus the option with the put hedge. While also requiring a $39k capital outlay.   What am I missing? Seems a great play. If the market keeps mooning I’m winning big. If it falls or stagnates, I’m out 3k only. Unless it really tanks, in which case my put would become profitable enough to still result in net gains.|2021-02-12 10:51:28

n23w5i|li8ul6|li8ul6|3|HUYA v2.0 DD:  1. Yesterday Morgan Stanley and RenTech filed 13-G announcing they now own 30%+ of HUYA (see [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542121000175/HuyaInc.txt) for MS and [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037389/000103738921000105/0001037389-21-000105.txt) for RenTech). The stock skyrocketed 20%. 2. Tencent already owns 51% of the stock (see article [here](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/tencent-huya-douyu-merger/)) 3. Hence approximately 97.5% of total float is owned by institutional that don't actively trade at all.  4. On the short side, you still have 20% to 30% of the total float sold short (see fintel [here](https://fintel.io/ss/us/huya)) 5. Finally fundamentals are excellent. High growth, low EV/Sales vs comps. I'm not even mentioning the potential of livestreaming in China.    I'm guessing a lot of the shorts are aware of this possible clusterf\*ck and will be exiting their positions over the next couple of days. However, there is still a monumental short-term opportunity as the available float is 1/10 than of the shorts as well as a long one buying a solid stock.  Enjoy !!|2021-02-12 07:58:16

It’s market cap is 1/20th of SNDL...   It has a 23% market share of 2.0 vapes, products, and edibles.  It’s currently trading over 80% below its value.   It has a projected growth of over 65%   It’s backed by imperials brands and received a CA$ 123M investment   It has a consensus rating BUY   They have 3.6% of the overall Canadian market   Tons of long term potential.

For example, I had a friend who just lost out on a weed stock. I forwarded him a write up that just got deleted for him to read and potentially throw 250k at a certain stock.  Now he can’t read it, and likely won’t have the same confidence I had after reading said write up.|2021-02-12 08:21:19

Yesterday they announced a stock buyout deal with a Canadian group. Then 350,000 calls for 3/19 $2.50c were bought. Another 200,000 spread between 4/16 and 2/26 $2.50c.  Last time this amount of preloaded calls were bought on Uranium, it was for CCJ and they jumped from $9.50 to $13 after the group bought all of the $12c.

n2d21z|li8ul6|li8ul6|1|  EV tax credit renewal and expansion gets first big push under Biden administration Tesla and General Motors are no longer eligible for tax credits, but the reintroduction of the GREEN Act would change that.   Sean Szymkowski headshot Sean Szymkowski Feb. 11, 2021 8:16 a.m. PT   US Capitol The House has legislation that would make GM and Tesla very happy. Bloomberg/Getty Images Back in 2019, Tesla and General Motors approached the cap after selling enough qualifying electric and plug-in hybrid cars that would exclude each automaker from future federal EV tax credits. Despite pushes in Congress to extend them, the measures ultimately failed. However, on Feb. 5, Democrats in the House of Representatives reintroduced the GREEN Act, which among many other tax code revisions would once again open Tesla and GM to federal EV tax credits.  Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Chairman of US House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue along with every other Democratic leader on the subcommittee signed onto the bill, hoping Congress will take it up under a Democratic-controlled Senate and the Biden administration. A similar bill was introduced in June of 2020, though it failed. The 2021 iteration of the GREEN Act is largely the same bill, but like its predecessor, it makes some notable changes to the current EV tax credit system.   Foremost, the max amount of money eligible drops by $500. Today, qualifying vehicles are eligible for up to a $7,500 tax credit; the new bill reduces the max amount to $7,000. Just like today's system, the amount follows an electrified vehicle's energy storage capacity. Essentially, the bigger the battery, the more money buyers can claim on their taxes with totally battery-electric cars eligible for the full amount. Plug-in hybrids often qualify for less since the battery only does part of the work powering the vehicle.  Most importantly, the provision includes nixing the 200,000 ceiling on these credits -- the cap Tesla and GM passed in 2019 and early 2020, which triggered a sunset period for the credits. Throughout 2019, Tesla's credits started to reduce, in accordance with the current law, and buyers snapped up all credits by the end of 2019. By March of 2020, GM ran dry, too.  Removing the ceiling would give Tesla and GM fresh ammunition to sell their EVs, and the 2021 GREEN Act would instead cap the credits at 600,000 qualifying vehicles sold. Just as importantly, the federal government would give automakers that already blew past the 200,000 cap a pass on any cars sold in the meantime. In other words, the vehicles Tesla and GM sold between the time their credits ran out and the day President Biden potentially signs the bill don't count toward the 600,000 figure. Instead, they start at 200,000.|2021-02-12 09:15:17

n2i6gm|li8ul6|li8ul6|0|AMD is a good company, but it is time to realize holding AMD at all time highs at a P/E ratio of 4 times that of Intel's makes no sense. Intel is legit undervalued in the most bubbled tech market since 2000. Its time to take profits in AMD and cycle into Intel. INTC is still the big boy in town, king of Silicon. With the semi shortage, the fact INTC is actually a producer of chips as well as designer and is an American corporation puts it primed to pump!|2021-02-12 09:54:59

n2fdl5|li8ul6|li8ul6|-7|Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!  In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:  I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on Etoro.(lower average)  Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:  As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)  Now what about Fidelity users:  32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)  DEGiro has 600K users:  600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro  What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212  ​  ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct  so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares  ​  Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!  We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM  OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!  Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)  38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available  ==============>>>>>>>>>>>> GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!  ​  Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted  67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!  ​  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-reddit-investing-213609595.html  In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.  32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??  ​  TNDLR  Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%  Institutions hold 113 %  Total= 193 % shares are on the market  SO the real Shorts number is 138%  ​  ​  Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be £Greedy ::  If you see mistakes please correct me....  ​  Alright even if living abroad not financial adviser just sharing my DD so please share for those paper hands scared and let's enjoy the road.... ;)  Cheers!  ​  From Luxembourg with Love !  ​  ADDED AFTER COMMENTS:  1. yes I forgot the world and Revolut and other APP 2. Read that article  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-gamestop-gme-135301233.html?guccounter=1  Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will "only pay" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME  Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)  Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....  https://i.imgur.com/apgRobV.jpg|2021-02-12 09:33:33

Is that how it works at every broker?  If I sell someone a $10 put for $3, I'd expect I'd only be assigned the shares if the underlying is <= $7.

We we were at the fore front of the fight between the the super rich who control the market and the super poor who gets rigged of every cent he invests. This is the battle of our own rights in the case of not being to buy a certain stock because a company decided it was too risky. This is the battle for social change and possibility of transfer of wealth.   I know what you retards are going to say “ we didn’t ask for this.” Or “bro this is a casino stfu” or whatever you fucking autist are memeing rn.

n2mp73|li8ul6|li8ul6|-7| Buy Build-a-bear. people were shilling it during GME, but upon looking closer the short interest is literally not even there because the play is actually solid. Build-a-bear has a unique advantage compared to most businesses in that the product it sells markets itself entirely, you go to build-a-bear to build yourself a stuffed animal and tell everyone else you built it and stuffed it yourself, rather then just simply buying a fucking stuffed bear. This gives it a unique position to capitalize on social media that the board just has not done yet, but have come to the realization of in the the nick of time. The brand alone is worth a billion dollars, this is a household name trading at microcap levels due to crystallized and stagnate valuations. This is essentially the greatest retail redemption arc ever told waiting to happen, and with JUST 15 million dollars could buy a controlling stake, including a bunch of autists pressuring the company to make frog plushies. Imagine if the shitty dress up games that 10 year old girls love to play asked them if they wanted to buy that doll in real life after they dressed it up, that is essentially the monetary minting machine waiting to be unearthed by build a bear     They're turning more money then before covid, management has picked up on it being time to seriously turn the business model around. The brand value is mostly held in the 15-24yo consumer segment group who were children and interacted with the business every time they went to the mall, brand value which can now be tangentially turned around and spread through social media like wildfire by selling either sex or memes. Build-a-bear lets you bust-a-nut on valentines for example, or else switch to selling stuffed frogs and emojis or other random lulz shit and give people weird decoration options. It is a fundamnetally unique buisness model that deserves a unique valuation, the brand recognition on that business alone is insane and it's only 80 mil mcap.|2021-02-12 10:29:08

I mean, sometimes I have some difficulties with the drivers for those machines so I just save my printed documents to a PDF and then email them to someone else to help me print them. Maybe he does that too. Like makes a word doc with two lines:  - Amount of treasuries to buy today - Amount of MBS to buy today  And then he saves it as a PDF and forwards it to an intern to print into the economy. I guess he could also just screenshot it and Slack it to someone to get the same effecf 🤷🏻‍♂️.   Anyways, wonder what his printing style is. Godspeed!|2021-02-12 08:36:39

n33i8x|li8ul6|li8ul6|-12|I have a theory about WSB and the recent explosion in activity  It is a simple theory really.  1) The word “retard” has been in this ambiguous state for a long time, with only a few daring lunatics (and edgy 12 year olds on XBOX) willing to use it in any public forum. Back in the 90s, it was a much more controversial term and was at the forefront of many social justice censorship movement. More recently, the SJWs have moved on to censoring much more impactful and offensive words, like “breast milk”, and “lady boy”. In this natural evolution of the naturally offended, the word retard has been left behind like a sad puppy on the side of the road whose owner lost all their money gambling on the internet.   2) At the same time, the word “retard” is such a powerful and satisfying derogatory term. I’m not sure if it is the way it rolls off the tongue, or the mental image it now produces of a drooling, bumbling millennial watching his wife’s boyfriend getting pegged by a hedge fund manager while frantically buying penny stocks on Robinhood. Or perhaps it is the context in which it used on WSB, self-deprecating and full of allusions to uncontrollable autism and wild impulsivity. All in all, the word really just *slaps*  3) The “anonymity” of Reddit creates an environment of relative impunity when using this word, the crowning glory of the bad words you got in trouble for saying to your mom after she caught you with 16TB of porn and took away your Nintendo 64 for 6 hours.   When you really step back and evaluate points 1-3, you will see, as I have seen, that the rise in popularity is not tied to any stock, but rather is tied to the glowing freedom experienced by shouting about retards from the proverbial rooftops of Reddit.   *disclaimer - I am a financial advisor and this is absolutely financial advice.

n2r6ja|li8ul6|li8ul6|-3| 💎  💎   🚀🚀🚀 💎  💎  " 🅱️ uild-A- 🅱️ ear Workshop is quite possibly the most recognizable microcap company on the planet"💎  💎  🚀🚀🚀  💎  💎   &#x200B;  Last generations investors have been burned and bored by the companies lack of turning this intangible MONOLITH of a brand into monetary gains, and have become jaded by it, overselling and undervaluing the company because it. Overselling it to such a degree that you can now buy the brand SEARED into every single childs brain in every small across america, for 80 MILLION DOLLARS.     First, some juicy numbers:   🅱️  🅱️ W corp has nearly 450+ stores operating internationally and domestically, in high traffic areas. With stores in most major malls across America, brand recognition for Build-a-bear marketing and products is inconsistent with the valuation.  From November 2nd 2019, to October 31st 2020, BBW had a comprehensive quarterly income increase of nearly 7 million dollars. Quarterly income for 2019 was plagued by low sales both online and instore mall locations. You would expect this trend to lead the companies demise after total mall retailer meltdowns from Covid, but with the companies 100%+ growth in ecommerce over the past year, as well as the closure of many liability locations, the company is actually far more profitable then before!  The companies liabilities have only increased a marginal 80%, largely from mall leases, which is nothing compared to the growth.  # What does the future of this company look like? 🌕  🌕   How about "Build-a-meme" or "build-a-emoji"   All it takes a slight shift, and the social media machine will PUMP this company to the moon. Take the timeless, cutesy, girly brand of Build-a-bear, and tweak it ever so slightly so that everyone across america wants to go out and build a fucking bear. Just imagine the front page of reddit, "LOOK WHAT BUILD-A-BEAR" LET ME BUILD FOR MY GIRLFRIEND" with a stuffed heart or rocket emoji, with little stitching saying "luv u bby"  Suddenly the masses want to build a fucking bear, they know where it's at, they know the website, they know the process, they know their girlfriend loves stuffed animals. Just a little push, all the brand needs|2021-02-12 11:02:09

I just think Nokia is one of the most underrated companies on the market.  &#x200B;  Let's just see what we know about Nokia today:  \- Nokia is in second place after Huawei in the field of telecommunications.  \- Nokia will replace Huawei in parts of BT's radio access network after expanding the terms of its contract with the UK phone incumbent.  \- Nokia and Google Cloud have put together a global strategic partnership aimed at supporting telecom providers' compute needs for 5G in both the core and the network edge.  \- Nokia's reporting for 2020 exceeded all expectations!  \- Nokia 3310 is the most indestructible phone in the world.  \- JP Morgan promises its growth.  &#x200B;  Based on all of the above, I can say with confidence - the **NOK = buy**.

n2qyal|li8ul6|li8ul6|-6|TWITTER tells me URANIUM is going to be "trendy" soon.    A quick guide:     \- Nuclear is the cleanest source of energy after Wind / Hydro.     \- Nuclear has the best space-to-generation efficiency compared to the cleanest sources (wind / hydro / solar).     \- Nuclear power is safe, the only  thing that still needs some work is the waste disposal, but while we learn how to dispose of it safely we at least know how to safely store the waste.    \- With the "green revolution" coming this year, we need a short-term solution to phase-out coal / oil. While eventually it will all be overtaken by solar / wind / hydro, the "fastest" way to phase out the old ones is to go Nuclear, Nuclear can produce enough power to sustain us while we build the necessary infrastructure for renewables.     \- URANIUM MINING companies and URANIUM ETFS will xplode this year.    \- GO LONG!|2021-02-12 11:00:29
