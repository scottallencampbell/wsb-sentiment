When will you dumb fucks understand there's not any good places to put the cash to work after pulling out of stocks? Why pull out of the greatest equity market in the world and just sit in cash/Ally savings to get raped by Inflation?   Buncha armchair economists you bears are. That you somehow know better than the managers of billions of dollars. That they are supposed to pull out now that there was a few weak economic data points lmao.   Ya they totally should listen to your biased philosophy of "well we are slowing down as an economy, that means we should all just sell everything and prepare for a global meltdown. Buy ammo and water bottles, it's over"  The hilarious part is you are using fundamental reasoning to justify short term trades lmao.

2f12ed|dd5un3|dd5un3|2|Would you all help me understand something? I had a bull credit spread on Disney. 127p/126p. After the stock rose, both of the options were priced at $0.01 per contract netting me a decent profit. I had 72 contracts for each leg, and I closed out the position for $0.01 per spread. Was this the ideal way to exit the trade or should I have just waited for expiration?   My profit dropped by $72 after this close, and I'm wondering if I'd held till the market closed, I would have made a bit more.   Also, when I executed that trade, robinhood asked me if I expected a credit or a debit. I selected debit since I was trying to close my bull credit position. Should I have selected credit?   Would appreciate any advice. Thanks!|2019-10-04 11:55:59

Resuming vent post here. tl;dr = fat fingered away 70% of gains.   The thing that really gets me, though, is that I had 0dte calls and, for the first time in a very long time, I actually pulled the trigger on the exit at the top at the perfect time. It was actually the high of the day (value wise, since theta eats 0dte so quickly). Instead of exiting at 100% gains, I doubled down at the tippy top. By the time I got the exit in it dropped and I ended up making 30% net instead.|2019-10-04 12:31:56
