When dealers are ➖ gamma, this is synchronous with volatility ⬆️  ::::::::  ⛔️If dealers are positioned in long OTM calls (➕ gamma),   ⛔️an increase in underlying prices causes a rise in their deltas, which leads to subsequent selling of the underlying to reel the position back to delta neutral.   ⚠️When their balance shifts to long OTM puts (➖ gamma),   ⚠️a drop in underlying prices = ⬆️ volatility since this induces selling to maintain hedges.  📝Market makers are in the business of providing liquidity and receive the bid/ask spread as compensation  📝Taking the difference between daily bid trades and ask represents a cleaner, more accurate picture of dealer positioning than a simple OI model.

Sometimes you have more exotic bets, like straddles, strangles or iron condoms. It’s just more expensive “Gambling”.  When you lose you justify with “market manipulation”, or “If I just …”, those scenarios are fictitious and justify in your head your Disgusting habit and need to keep coming back.

i5jo7n|qg31bx|qg31bx|0|Today I bought a SPY 457 straddle 10/27 in the morning, intending to only hold on for just today. My impression was that this contract pays out when there's extreme price movement, and limits downside when there's little movement. However, your gains are essentially halfed because you're paying for the other option. According to OptionStrat the maximum downside was only supposed to be a couple of %. However, after the downswing today it looks like that the losses are much higher than expected (~10-15% rather than in the single digits as predicted by OptionStrat). It looks like that the "danger zone" where you lose money on little movement incurred more losses than predicted. What am I missing here from my understanding, and would it have been better to use a strangle or guts strategy to limit my downside?|2021-10-26 14:34:17

These are 2 to 16 billion market cap companies that earned $800 million-$47 billion in income.  So if that's how much damage those companies are feeling, imagine the thousands of other companies in those ranges.  The news is trying to cover it up along with the feds, but I suspect once we enter November it won't be possible to cover up the financial damage of these shortages.
