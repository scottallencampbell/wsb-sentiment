Or to watch all the marvel movies.   I guess Kardashians to Hulu is... news?  I still think their whole valuation right now is insane given their major revenue streams were screwed for almost a year.

fetjms|kb0pf8|kb0pf8|6|We need to have a Great Purge and period of huge losses to wipe out euphoria and idiotic retailers massively over pumping equities.    ABNB worth more than basically all major hotel chains combined even though hotels actually own prime real estate.   SNOW valued 100x more than the worst .com companies ever were.   NIO worth more than BMW and GM even though the latter actually sell millions of cars and make billions in profits.  DASH worth billions although it has zero moat and just hemorrhages money.   LAZR worth billions even though they just lose money every year and won't be profitable for years.   QS worth billions even though it has no product until 2024 and won't even sell $1b in revenues until 2027  Tank this shit hard and torch these fools.  We need a true .com correction followed by over 1-2 years of bearish trading with no FED intervention to teach these clowns. Flush these turds down the toilet and cut all the fat out.

If suddenly there was news that ‚Äúwell covid infection and death rates are accelerating 50% faster than expected and 2x the amount of people we thought had it have had it and having it doesn‚Äôt yield any protection from getting it again‚Äù then that would impact the markets because it wasn‚Äôt expected. 500,000 infections a day won‚Äôt shock the markets if it was able to be estimated 2 months ago.|2020-12-11 13:46:16
