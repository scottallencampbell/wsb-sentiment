f2bfvg|k92ab0|k92ab0|115|First Citron came for the nio bros, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Chinese EV bull.  Then they came for the palantards, and I did not speak out— because I was not a call holder.  Then they came for the Lazr squad, and I did not speak out—because I was too afraid to fomo in during the run.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.|2020-12-08 10:06:26
f1qex8|k92ab0|k92ab0|178|So let me get this straight. UBER just sold its automation division, which it was hanging 100% of its hopes of ever being profitable on. So it is now literally a taxi company valued at $94 billion with no path to profitability that loses money on every ride. It lost $8 billion last year, which probably makes it the single biggest incinerator of investor capital in the world. And it's down.... 2%?|2020-12-08 06:38:26

PLTR is going to be worth 500 billion in 5 years. The stock is meming but it's not a meme stock, they're building awesome tech, are bankrolled by the gov't, and are expanding into a rapidly growing consulting business which everyone who's touched has nothing but lavish praise for.  Squabbling about $27, $23, $30? in 2025, the only problem you are gonna have is that you didn't buy more when this stock is trading at $250 per share.

f1wusa|k92ab0|k92ab0|20|Some advice. Buy calls or puts on something with a big rally or steep drop. If it keeps dropping or keeps rising sell a call or put at a higher/lower strike. This locks in gains and lowers max risk, where you still have the potential for gains if it continues the trend. Also if you think there’s a sell off or fake pump then you can buy back your sell at a lower price and wait for the next rise and fall. You’re not going to get 10 baggers this way, but you’ll at least have sustained gains|2020-12-08 07:56:13

f2qdws|k92ab0|k92ab0|12|putting this in the comments instead of a post so it doesn’t get the wrong kind of attention.  Do not buy GME calls today. Market makers will dump all their stock during earnings and crash the price — this plus IV crush will let them buy back all the call options they sold for very cheap.  Instead, wait for the earnings dump and pile in on calls  when they’re cheap to stop the MMs from being able to get out of their positions.  Then we can create a really vicious squeeze|2020-12-08 12:02:27

A recent SEC filing, first cited by The Block, reveals Citadel Securities and a handful of other firms paid Robinhood nearly $100 million in the first quarter of 2020 alone. These payments are the company’s primary revenue stream—far outstripping what it earns from its premium service, Robinhood Gold, or from the interest it makes on cash balances in customer accounts.

f1w162|k92ab0|k92ab0|15|Do any of you guys have a daily stock trading routine?  Here's what I do every morning. I wake up at 5 AM and immediately take a shower in ice cold water. I then have a breakfast of raw oats, 2 whole eggs, and coffee grounds. I then put on a black suit and tie and grease my hair (I work from home, but I think its important to always look your best).   From there, I am ready to trade stocks and do investments. My portfolio is quite impressive, mostly Apple and Tesla stock. I leverage the markets all day, only taking breaks to drink lemon water and relieve myself. This may seem out of the ordinary, much like Christian Bale in American Pyscho, but it helps me focus my mind on business. In fact, my internet friends call me "The Businessman" due to my characteristic suit and my expertise on stocks.   Do any of you have a similar routine?|2020-12-08 07:47:21
f2sgwc|k92ab0|k92ab0|14|Cramer admitted we call the shots now, citron is gunna learn a hard lesson in that fucking with WSB only results in a nice painal delivered by us chad bulls. If we want Sharks with frikkin lazr beams then by god LAZR 100 end of week. If we want China bucks then fuck you citron NIO 100 end of January. If we want the god damn eye of sauron watching us when we jack off then fuckin PAlantir 50 end of month. It’s our market now shitron, you’re just getting cucked in it as WSB slowly becomes aware of its true power...you fool this isn’t even our final form!!!|2020-12-08 12:18:15
f1lrnz|k92ab0|k92ab0|12|TSLA news is the catalyst bears have been waiting on.  With call volume sky high across the market all they have to do is lean hard as fuck on TSLA and it will translate over to everything else.  Not saying crash or anything but this could be the beginning of a good 5-10% correction depending on the level of panic selling.  It’s honestly about time but this fucking market may just shake it off after one algo driven red day anyway.  Either way I wouldn’t be buying the TSLA dip for at least a day or two.|2020-12-08 05:27:02

You have a one of a kind stock in a new frontier sector, you have a super rich customer base that's only going to get richer from the money printers running, and after they establish the tourism sector they are going to go after transportation; ie offering rich people 3 hours flights from London to Tokyo.   8 Billion market cap on SPCE is a steal.

f1wtci|k92ab0|k92ab0|3|Realistically shouldnt really be too steep a drop today on Tesla. But if there is take it as a gift for the following days when the rally continues. This offering should come at no surprise to anyone. Tesla still has plenty of room to run up until the 21st. This is the perfect time for Elon to do this offering. If you have long dated calls just hold them through. It will not stay down. This isnt a real correction yet - it is just people selling out in anticipation for a dip which shouldnt be anything significant.|2020-12-08 07:55:47

f1m0yl|k92ab0|k92ab0|5|Holy shit I just lost so much money in like 1 minute.   Anyways the problem here is that while 5 billion is barely any dilution at all, this acts as a catalyst for profit takers to start trimming their positions. Once people start trimming and the stock starts moving down, day traders, shorters are going to start jumping on board. By the time the dip ends TSLA could be down 10% for the day.  &#x200B;  I don't have the balls to short the stock but I did sell all my shares.|2020-12-08 05:31:15

f2dgf4|k92ab0|k92ab0|6|Alright so I'm retrded lets get that out of the way now. How is what Citron does legal?  And why does he have so much influence within the stock market? He could literally tweet about any stock being too high and it immediately dips?? He's got the easiest job in the world. Short a stock that's having a monster month and then tweet that he's shorting it and immediately he starts profiting? I wasn't in LAZR so It doesn't really effect  me but he's fucked my positions twice in the last month. I just don't get it|2020-12-08 10:22:23
f2dnq3|k92ab0|k92ab0|7|CFRA REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF TESLA, INC.  We raise our 12-month price target by $100 to $750, implying a '22 P/E of130.4x. Our estimates remain unchanged for now. This morning, TSLA announced a$5B at-the-market equity offering. The announcement follows a $5B equityoffering it completed in September. We consider the decision to do anotherequity offering prudent in light of the stock's meteoric run-up and Musk'sambitious plan to increase annual vehicle volumes by 40x by the end of thisdecade (from ~500K units this year to 20M), which will require copious capitallevels. We think the key question is whether TSLA will continue down the path ofgreenfield growth, or whether it will become more aggressive on the acquisitionfront. With an estimated $72B of index fund purchases that need to be made aheadof the stock's December 21 addition to the S&P 500, we recommend using anyweakness from today's announcement as a buying opportunity. The net impact ofthe two recent equity offerings is relatively modest EPS dilution following thestock's run-up.|2020-12-08 10:24:00

Nio is not an IPO. Remember Nikola.  They cannot ALL win. If you have done well, maybe get out. If you want my hunch which one will survive then it’s Canoo   Maybe Lordstown. Not Nikola, Hylion or Arrival.   Positions are shares only as options tricky in UK: NNOX, NIO, COSTCO, ALTRIA, PSTH, AZN, Walgreens / Boots. CRSR. Tesla but sadly only 4 shares.

I plan on waiting to see where this settles and then loading up on more March calls.

The security/smart home theme is only going to grow in the next 5 years and I expect ARLO to steadily climb to $10b marketcap assuming they can clinch 7% market share which is on the low end imo|2020-12-08 11:09:19

f295me|k92ab0|k92ab0|4|So wait?? Tesla now stock offering? Right at market high after the inevitable pullback anyway? This has gone too far. Now they are trying to convince investors that the selloff was predetermined to raise more capital so it can continue its run up?   &#x200B;  This is elementary trading folks... Read Bulkowski's encylopedia of chart patters and stop burning your money on FOMO's!   &#x200B;  I still have this impending feeling that retail investors will short the shit out of Tesla to get it back sub 500 before S&P inclusion... Why pay 600 when you can pay 500?   &#x200B;  Big money wins. Always!   &#x200B;  Disclaimer: I am long term Tesla bull. Recently stopped trading it though and just sitting on a few shares I invested pre-split. I still hope it goes up... Just drinking my coffee with a reasonable amount of scepticism after I got burned big in Septemberrrr. My advice to everyone out there. Don't get caught up thinking you could make millions from hundreds from a single stock. It rarely happens. And when it does the trader normally has multiple positions open at the same time to cover them during dips, and usually a shed load of experience to boot.   &#x200B;  Diversify! Take profit (most of the time), or at least limit exposure.|2020-12-08 09:47:59

f2j0xd|k92ab0|k92ab0|4|Hi guys I want your help. I’m 10 years old and I saved money that my mom gives me on the weekends when some guys come over every few hours for her for an hour and then leaves. I made like 500K from investing and wanted to ask how much should I take out so I can buy some nice hot wheels set and add more to my pog collection. Thank you and hopefully PLTR goes up to 69 (which everyone tells me it’s a funny number but I don’t understand the joke).|2020-12-08 11:05:55

f3jcbw|k92ab0|k92ab0|4|So GME just beat eps estimates by $0.56 per share. That's huge. If you sold, you just got bamboozled. This is incredibly good for the company. They reported slightly lower than expected revenue, but that's what happens when you cut costs. I'd rather them have shitty revenue and a small loss than revenue growth and a big loss. They weren't overplaying their hand and racking up debt, that's a good thing. They're saving their resources for the next fiscal quarter which will include black friday and holiday shopping. Nobody expected this to be an exciting earnings report, but it is a very healthy report for the company.|2020-12-08 15:44:59

At least with an earnings call it can be 'better than expected' and the price goes up, whereas here the best outcome is 'we landed like we intended', which I reckon is already priced in.  There's no great outcome from the test that would bring forward the operational go-live or affect future revenue.

But Cisco has said it is not looking to do large M&A deals right now,  Fish also thinks that Cisco is more strategically aligned with others in the content delivery network market, including Akamai Technologies (AKAM). He asserts that Cisco is using Akamai for web-delivery of services, and says that “the two have a strong partnership.”  “While we are not outright dismissing the possibility… we lean toward this being improbable,” Fish writes.  Both Cisco and Fastly on Tuesday declined to comment, citing their policies of not responding to rumors.|2020-12-08 13:04:48

They also are the most indebted company in the world with over 150 billion in debt last I looked.  Their management is still shit.  They are a value trap long term.  That share price won't stay over 30 for long.  If you buy shares you are simply bailing out the people who have held T for years underwater.

f2rjrg|k92ab0|k92ab0|0|People don't get why VLDR struggles to go up.  There are probably tons of shares from PIPE investors left.  They were waiting for a run-up to start selling off again to make more profits. They've been hosing the stock good ever since VLDR went public because GRAF didn't have a lockout period post merger.  Immediately after going public, VLDR tanked. Now retailers who've done 0 DD on VLDR and its SPAC are learning the hard way what PIPE investors are.  LAZR at least has a lockup period, but the stock will eventually get pounded by PIPE shares too in several months, and bagholders will feel pain if they're still holding LAZR by then.|2020-12-08 12:11:19

Looking to the next ground level thing: ABNB. I know we can't predict the future but to those who have been doing this a while, is this worth getting in early?|2020-12-08 08:07:18
