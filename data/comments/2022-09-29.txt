Not because you liked hunting, but because you wanted to spend time with him. He'd take you and a case of beer up into a deer stand, and you'd both sit in silence for hours. The only sound to ever punctuate the stillness was the pop and hiss of beers opening. Dawn would come and cast light upon the dew and fog, then the afternoon sun would rise and burn off the morning haze, and still you both sat in silence.  On one such morning, without looking at you he said, "Do you know why I come out here?" Words got trapped in your mouth, dry from lack of use. Before you could say anything, he continued, "The unknown. I give this place a day of my time and my ready gun, not knowing what it will give me in return." He stopped and did look at you then, and whispered, "But knowing it could give me something special." He then drank another beer, faster than usual. "Most other days I know exactly what I'll get: The same old bullshit."  You thought of your old man this morning while you drank a beer and stared out the window at the morning dew, ignoring the full pot of coffee your wife had brewed. You thought of him as you used your phone to buy options, and you thought of him as you felt the Theta sun rise and burn off the early, magical mist of your buys. You're about to go home empty handed, with no trophy deer--without even a whiff of one. But you smile as you crack open another beer. It could have happened. It could have. Which is more than you can say about other days, full of the same old bullshit.|2022-09-29 13:25:13qedev2|xr3qns|xr3qns|6|Spy playing "just the tip" with 360.00.|2022-09-29 13:30:10qedhh9|xr3qns|xr3qns|7|Here comes a nonsense pump till eod|2022-09-29 13:30:39qedhuq|xr3qns|xr3qns|6|Literally just puts on anything for a year.

The US, in secret, has been buying US treasury from abroad at a 30% markup. Why would they do that?   The billion dollar question is: Why the fuck would the US overpay buying Treasury? To what benefit?  Because of this, asset prices are completely distorted and INCORRECT.   Meaning that price you see on your watchlist is off, it's either much higher or much lower.

January 2022 inflation rate: 7.48%  "The inflation that we are experiencing is just nothing that we have experienced in decades... All the things we did during the pandemic, we turned our dials as hard as we could... Part of what we did and what Congress did is the reason why inflation is so high."  Jerome Powell March 2nd, 2022.  February 2022 inflation rate: 7.87%  "These higher prices have real effects on people's well-being and it takes a toll on everyone. If you're at the lower end of the income spectrum it's very hard because you are spending most of your money on necessities, but it's punishing for everyone... We can't blame the framework. It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation and then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was."  Jerome Powell March 16th, 2022.  February 2022 inflation rate: 7.87%  "The rise in inflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters generally expected... We're not expecting near-term progress on inflation."  Jerome Powell March 21st, 2022.  February 2022 inflation rate: 7.87%  "It is appropriate in my view to be moving a little more quickly... We had an expectation that inflation would peak around this time and then come down over the course of the rest of the year. These expectations have been disappointing in the past and now we want to see actual progress... Are we going back to the old economy? Probably not. What's the new one going to look like?"  Jerome Powell April 21st, 2022.  March 2022 inflation rate: 8.54%  "We have a good chance at a soft or softish landing... There's a false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don't really feel... the economy is doing fairly well... I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession."  Jerome Powell May 4th, 2022.  April 2022 inflation rate: 8.26%  "I have said, and I will say it again, if you had perfect hindsight, you'd go back and it probably would have been better for us to have raised rates a little sooner... So the question whether we can execute a soft landing or not, it may actually depend on factors that we don't control."  Jerome Powell May 12th, 2022.  April 2022 inflation rate: 8.26%  "We all read the inflation reports very carefully, and look for details that look positive, but truthfully, this is not the time for tremendously-nuanced readings of inflation... Sometimes the landing is just perfect, sometimes it's a little bumpy. It's still a good landing, you don't even notice it... There could be some pain involved in restoring price stability, but we think we can sustain a strong labor market."  Jerome Powell May 17th, 2022.  April 2022 inflation rate: 8.26%  "We're not trying to induce a recession now, let's be clear on that. We're trying to achieve 2% inflation and a consistently strong labor market... We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful at getting inflation down to 2%."  Jerome Powell June 15th, 2022.  May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%  "The American economy is very strong and well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy... It is a possibility our rate rises could cause a recession... We're not trying to provoke and don't think that we will need to provoke a recession."  Jerome Powell June 22nd, 2022.  May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%  "During the summer months of 2021, inflation was coming down month-by-month. So that told us that our thesis that this was going to be a passing inflation shock was at least plausible... We did underestimate it, we clearly did... In hindsight, it [inflation] was not transitory."  Jerome Powell June 23rd, 2022.  May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%  "We now understand better how little we understand about inflation. This was unpredicted... We fully appreciate the pain people are going through."  Jerome Powell June 29th, 2022.  May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%  "I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession... We're trying to do just the right amount. We're not trying to have a recession... These are not normal times. There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than, I think, there ordinarily is and, ordinarily, it’s quite high.... We’re trying to not to make a mistake."  Jerome Powell July 27th, 2022.  June 2022 inflation rate: 9.10%  "While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation... While the latest economic data has been mixed, in my view, our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum."  Jerome Powell August 26th, 2022.  July 2022 inflation rate: 8.50%  "We have got to get inflation behind us, I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't... Our expectation has been we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply side healing, we haven't. We have seen some supply side healing but inflation has not really come down... I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time. We're looking for it to come down, but it's not exactly clear when that will happen."  Jerome Powell September 21st, 2022.  August 2022 inflation rate: 8.30%|2022-09-29 10:24:17qckrx8|xr3qns|xr3qns|3|What's crazy is I've lost and made more money on a single trade than some people will make in an entire year|2022-09-29 05:09:37qclqfq|xr3qns|xr3qns|3|WAR IS COMING, BAGHOLDERS AND DEGENS IN TANKS TO FIGHT RUSSIA, END OF NORDSTREAM (RIP EUROPOORS), FLORIDA MEN ONLY LIVING SPECIMEN LEFT ALIVE BY HURRICANE|2022-09-29 05:22:34qcoj2g|xr3qns|xr3qns|4|Fuckin kangaroo ass market|2022-09-29 05:57:48qcq3cm|xr3qns|xr3qns|4|Conference Board Economic Forecast: While we do not believe the US economy is currently in recession - due to strength in a number of sectors and the extremely tight labor market – we expect that a broad downturn in the economy is on the way. Nevertheless, we are upgrading our forecast for Q3 2022 from 0.0 percent to 0.3 percent – largely due to an upward revision in the previous quarter’s GDP data and several indicators pointing to a slight improvement in the economic momentum at the beginning of the quarter. However, we expect these improvements to be short-lived as the Fed continues to raise interest rates to curb stubbornly high inflation readings. While consumer spending isn’t likely to contract until Q4 2022, we expect non-residential investment to buckle under the weight of higher interest rates sooner. Residential investment will continue to contract as the housing market finds a new equilibrium.|2022-09-29 06:15:38qcqbbr|xr3qns|xr3qns|4|Everyone posting their full english breakfast on reddit makes me fucking sick.

This company, Shuttle pharmaceuticals, just finished it's IPO this month. Here are some of the details.   They are an R&D company with with an administration initiative of fighting the effects of cancer, and cancer treatment related symptoms.  Flagship drugs are Ropidoxuridine, which is a sensitizer of rapidly dividing cancer cells, and Dorandidazole, a sensitizer of hypoxic cells.   Further, they are also in development of a dual action drug that will activate ATM genes within cells to fortify and repair against the effects of radiation therapy, which is one of the most frustrating parts about this type of therapy.    OK, SO.  Upon IPO, the share price shot up to highs in the $120 area, and settled around $30's and $40 range, which I imagine was profit taking and shorts entering positions, stabilizing there for a few days.   Around this time they released good news in the form of a patent for their drug Ropidoxuridine. After this news came out, the share price plunged 75%!    Ok, so maybe that's a little normal for our market, BUT, the following week after a weekend we saw more good news in the form of a manufacturing agreement with greenchem to produce about 55 lbs of Ropidoxuridine to finish up their clinical trials and get it to market. Shares continued to plunge after this news.    From everything I have read so far, this company doesn't seem to be bleeding cash (5 employeescurrently, and not a lot of debt), and is making heavy strides towards putting drugs on the market that would make them billions in revenue.    Ever since these drops, there has been a floor they are trying and failing to break through around the $5 to $7 range. Been sitting in this area for over a week, with a borrow fee in the 40s, and no sign that shorts have covered hardly any position. Volume is rapidly diminishing over time, with a new low yesterday of under a million. One weird spike to 14 million the other day, but it could have been an attempt to shake more investors.    So, what's the fuck is going on here? I know cancer and medical stocks get shorted, but this seems very extreme, and I need help with crayons to connect the dots. My brain is slippery smooth, and cannot compute more technical information on this matter.   Chart signs seem bullish, but no volume is there to support a breakthrough.   Please tell me if I'm regarded or if this might a play that will pay out if I'm patient. I can be patient, but If there is something I'm missing, I would like to know.

From the entire sales in Michigan in the last year, sales are pretty similar to what they were last August, prices have gone up slightly from what they were last august, and then the average time that a house takes to sell has only gone up two days when compared to this time last year.   You can see from the chart (at least in Michigan) that sales have actually increased over the last 7 months, and new listings have increased… the only thing that’s accurate in that post is that mortgage rates are higher (no surprise) and prices have gone down about $10,000 from last month.    They’re nothing compared to what they were in the 70’s and 80’s… some of my co-workers were telling me rates used to be at like 17% when they started in the business   6.5% is not a lot at all in the grand scheme of things… also houses that are over usually $500,000 tend to get rates around 5%   What is the bearish response to this argument|2022-09-29 08:15:28qd3563|xr3qns|xr3qns|1|Good for nothing pajama traders.

Acknowledge that forward looking indicators do show inflation coming down. If the market suddenly tries to buy up bonds and reduce yields then they should stabilize it by directly selling treasuries instead of just letting them run off.   Essentially right now they think they have to scare the market with their tone or else the market will undo the work on the yields they have so far done. I'm saying if the market starts doing that they can sell their balance sheet to force yields to stay where they want them.
