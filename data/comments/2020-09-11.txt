4v530s|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|15|## Daily Market and Options Summary for Today -  ## Daily Synopsis   * The S&P 500 increased 0.1% on this 19th anniversary of 9/11 but continued selling in the mega-caps limited the upside. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.7%) closed lower.  * Similar to the days before, today's price action was technically-oriented given the absence of market-moving news and the losses in stocks like Apple (AAPL 112.00, -1.49, -1.3%), Amazon (AMZN 3116.22, -58.89, -1.9%), and Microsoft (MSFT 204.03, -1.34, -0.7%) on no specific corporate news. Apple shares fell 7.4% this week.  * The difference today was that their losses were offset by relative strength in the cyclical sectors, namely industrials (+1.4%), materials (+1.3%), and financials (+0.8%). Still, when Apple and Amazon are down more than 1.0%, there must be more winners than losers to make a meaningful difference.  * There were more of the latter on Friday, as declining issues outpaced advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq. The information technology (-0.8%), consumer discretionary (-0.3%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors ended the day in negative territory due to their exposure to the mega-cap stocks.  * Interestingly, the S&P 500 was down as much as 0.9% intraday and fell below its 50-day moving average (3322). A broad rebound in the afternoon, however, helped the benchmark index turn positive and close above the key technical level.  * Shares of Oracle (ORCL 57.00, -0.33, -0.6%), Peloton (PTON 84.04, -3.71, -4.2%), and Kroger (KR 34.37, -0.37, -1.1%) finished lower following their earnings reports. Note, ORCL shares were up as much as 7.9%, and PTON shares were up as much as 11.8%.  * U.S. Treasuries finished on a higher note. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 93.28. WTI crude futures increased 0.2%, or $0.07, to $37.34/bbl. * There are no notable economic reports scheduled for Monday.  ## Index Summary  **S&P 500 :** (+0.05%);  **NasDaq :** (-0.62%);   **Russell 2000 :**(-0.67%);  **Dow :**(+0.47%);   **Vix :**29.71 (-9.56%); \[-20.03%\]; {+17.03%}  ## Sector Summary -  *Three highest sectors for today were -*   **Industrials:** (+1.36%); **Materials:** (+1.28%); **Financials:** (+0.69%)   *Three lowest sectors for today were -*   **Information Technology:** (-0.76%); **Real Estate:** (-0.34%); **Communication Services:** (-0.32%)     ## Commodities/Futures  (1-day %), \[5-day %\], {10-day %}  ***Currency -***   **USD Index :**93.331 (-0.08%); \[+0.58%\]; {+1.23%}; **BC :**10315 (+0.15%); \[-2.73%\]; {-12.72%}  ***Precious Metals -***   **Gold :**1964.3 (-0.72%); \[+1.36%\]; {-0.89%}; **Silver :**27.291 (-1.25%); \[+1.39%\]; {-5.24%}  ***Farming -***   **Soybeans :**977.5 (+2.05%); \[+2.52%\]; {+4.45%}; **Corn :**365 (+1.23%); \[+5.27%\]; {+5.72%};   **Coffee :**131.7 (-0.23%); \[-1.05%\]; {-0.38%}  ***Industrials -***   **Crude :**37.3 (+0.32%); \[-5.91%\]; {-12.18%}; **Nat Gas :**2.323 (-3.14%); \[-13.06%\]; {-14.45%}   **Copper :**2.9985 (+1.45%); \[-0.15%\]; {+0.03%}  ## Options Fast Facts  ***CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.54***   ***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** AES with 30x the ADV of 1228.

4tgjyl|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|12|Dear Sweet Baby Jesus,   Please wreck WMT and NKLA. WMT never should have climbed above $133, but people got excited about that Tiktok nonsense. And NKLA is a fraud and should go to zero, but you can take your time with that. Screw WMT down below $133 by eod, plz.  I'll do the standard $5 each for two hobos if you make this happen (I'm seeing a lot more hobos around). And I'll continue to praise your name among the nonbelievers and haters.    Keep on keeping on,   Anal Casanova  p.s. Yes I remember that it was YOU in all your glory that hyped the masses about WMT and drove the price too high, but I'm asking you to turn the hype off now.

Or retarded?*      I made up my mind months ago that Trevor Milton was a con artist and NKLA was a scam simply by reading this statement:      "**The entire infotainment system is a HTML 5 super computer**," Milton said. "That's the **standard language for computer programmers around the world**, so using it lets us build our own chips. And **HTML 5 is very secure**. Every component is linked on the data network, all speaking the same language. It's not a bunch of separate systems that somehow still manage to communicate."

It will definitely be less than Nordictrack's commercial bikes which start at $1,600. As someone who has Ifit and has used Peloton's app. Peloton is miles ahead.

My father lost a close friend on that day. If you know someone who has lost someone on 9/11, give them a call or a text within the next few days. It‚Äôs a tough time and it will mean a lot to them for someone to check in on them.|2020-09-11 07:43:51

4td7nu|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|19|I adderal posted this list of currently cheap value stocks with some DD yesterday evening. Thought I'd throw it up one more time because it might help someone.   Disclosure, I bought all of these stocks at or near the bottom recently.   > I know a lot of you are upset about the way the market is shifting but there is a ton of bright side out there.   > I'm not an expert so you might know better, but here are some value stocks you can currently get at multi-month low prices that have a lot of room to grow and absolutely won't go under. This is more for stocks than options btw.   > T- At a three month low, and doesn't move much. Has a high morning star valuation. In addition to their cell network they own Warner Brothers, Cartoon Network, HBO, and a bunch of other stuff including a video games division. Most importantly, HBO MAX has arguably the best streaming catalog out there. The moment they finalize a deal with ROKU to get on there or Comcast finishes integrating their app it's going to be huge. They have Friends and the Big Bang Theory so they will have the normie audience locked down.   > GE- At a three month low. Will benefit from vaccine production, has a great diversified portfolio, and a likely beneficiary of government contracts. Most importantly it's got a 5 star Morning Star rating.   > CVS- 3 month low, 5 stars from morning star, will benefit in a big way from looming vaccinations.   > BTI- British American Tobacco owns a huge catalog of cigarette and cigar brands, something that remains very popular in much of the world. They've also got a foothold in the ecig industry. Most importantly, the UK is taking in millions of rich Hong Kong smokers soon. It also has a 5 star morning star rating.   > DEO- near three month low, has been gaining very nicely lately but dipped a little today. The moment bars open this stock will damn near double and until then you can expect profits to wildly increase from winter drinking. This company owns most of the most well known liquor brands. Johnny Walker, Captain Morgan, Ketel One, Aviation Gin (Ryan Reynold's thing, dope bottle), Ciroc, Smirnoff, J&B, Crown Royal, Don Julio and so on and so forth. One of my favorite stocks.   > AMCX- 5 star morning star rating, currently at the best price you'll ever find. Has the best prestige tv catalog aside from HBO, especially for the streaming market. Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Walking Dead (spin offs incoming), Legion, MAD MEN, Killing Eve, Halt and Catch Fire, and a huge collection of other things that will always be streaming on multiple platforms. They've also got Shudder, which is probably the best niche streaming service and will do gangbusters next month.  > MSFT - If you don't buy MSFT at 205 there is literally no helping you. They're the only option for business. They benefit from students doing class from home since you can't use exam software on chrome books. Teams has become huge. They just got that huge Jedi contract from the government. They're one of the only tech companies that's not on the verge of getting fucked hard by the federal government... and they're absolutely about to get Tik Tok. Currently undervalued by about 10% according to Morning Star and that's not factoring in the spread of Teams of the fact that the additional data mining from Tik Tok may finally make Bing a real competitor. Oh, and of course, the new Xbox. Game pass (streaming service for video games) is also fantastic and will soon become the new industry standard.   > SWBI - As low as you're likely to see it. Gun sales are huge and they'll spike even more once threats of gun grabbing become part of the campaign. Believe me, Republicans always use this in the run up to the end because it rallies moderate conservatives better than anything else. Constant riot footage also means constant gun sales, and based on recently released earnings information the concerns about supply problems that have kept the stock from mooning have been put to bed. Best of all, while threats of gun bans will stimulate sales, they're also not a threat at all anymore. On the gun issue, the court is solidly 5-4. And it's likely to soon be 6-3 as Ginsberg surviving until January is very unlikely.   > Finally, and most controversially, XOM - Its as low as it could possibly get and the question of its future is entirely about when it kicks back up, not if. Increased travel from the holidays will push it over. Not to mention increased tension in the South China Sea means a lot of carriers and planes wasting a lot of fuel. It also has a 5 star Morning Star rating. **UPDATE: My brother got an email saying that they're maintaining their nice dividend. There had been a ton of articles speculating that they would cut or drop it.**  > Bonus recommendation- Not blue chip like the others, but DXLG offers more growth at better odds than any other stock you'll find. A well established chain store that sells high end brands (Lacoste, Polo, etc. etc.) in big and tall sizes. If you've been outside recently you know that Covid has made Americans MUCH fatter. They also have a very well developed online store. They currently sit at around 1/6 their precovid numbers, and their recent earnings report painted a positive picture. There is also a huge wall of shares preventing it from falling below 25 cents. Their set up will also allow them to benefit from ongoing small business assistance from federal Covid discretionary funds. I've got thousands of shares and I'll be holding until it's back to the nearly two dollars it was at before, though with the additional fatties it could get even better. *  Hope this info helps somebody out there. We're moving into uncertain time, and these stocks are all things you can park your money in and get guaranteed gains beyond any index.   Remember, a down market is a buying opportunity. Since stocks usually only go up, make sure to pounce when you can!|2020-09-11 06:57:33

4tto6v|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|5|The great thing about capitalism is that we get to profit from frauds. They get burned. I feel bad for their shareholders though, they bought into a dream. Personally, I think hydrogen fuel is also part of the future solution for energy.   But this T Milton guy is such a hillbilly. The report is great, and reading this guys tweets or listening to him makes you realize how full of shit he is. He is trying to emulate the legend Elon musk. The great musk says things which he eventually achieves, he is ambitious, not a liar. Pretty clear when hillbilly mills tweets some of the same things as musk like shorty shorts or placing imo in random places. It‚Äôs sad but hilarious.   GM only partnered with them because of the image of clean tech. They took absolutely nothing from Nikola outside of the name. That name is tarnished. Why in the hell would they stay in? And even if they do. All that‚Äôs left is that name. How much is the name worth? 13b? Hells nah. 2b? Idk, maybe but only if it‚Äôs viewed in a positive light.

4ttp43|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|7|If I was a broke kid who just lost all his money looking for a way to hustle it back, I'd go into SEO/marketing. I took a few tabs of acid and read the google white papers and then started a niche business that I was able to get to #2 and 3 spots on google for exact keywords, #1 for some others. Then I learned about how useful FB marketing is. Right off the top I excluded college educated people and feminists from seeing my ads, take out a lot of rabble right away.  The targeting they give you is ridiculous. I got a gig for a personal injury lawfirm in brooklyn and was able to use a bunch of ethnic immigrant foods crossed with social welfare programs to target the exact clientele they were looking for.  People are going to say it's saturated but if you know how to pitch to a business owner you can succeed anywhere.   edit: positions - bent over sideways on qqq|2020-09-11 09:46:28

4u1tix|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|7|Costly lessons this week:  * Closed RH IC out when long leg was ITM to reduce loss, at 350%. Had I held, would be profitable today. * On top of this, I calculated the spread on the RH IC incorrectly, and had I paid attention to the value of each wing (rather than the net cost) I would have pushed the call wing up further and been in even better shape. * Bought NKLA 43p FD on runup Tues, only to see stock hit 51. Sold for breakeven when stock came down Wed. Would have been up 250% right now intrinsic. * Sold a **short** butterfly when the strategy I wanted was a regular butterfly. Know your strategy.  Overall up for the week slightly despite the numerous fuckups. Had I paid better attention and held my FDs out until expiry, I'd be in a much better position.

More interestingly, they wrote:  > >We are reaching out to you because it has come to our attention that there was a technical issue with our margins system today that resulted in PM accounts receiving much more leverage than they should have today.

He pretends he's the captain spotting icebergs, he has Titanic toys that break apart that he plays with in the tub, he plays Titanic themed servers on Roblox, and he watches Titanic YouTube videos all the time. It's a little morbid when you think about how tragic the event was, although it was a long time ago.  Honestly makes me think though, how long in the future until it's the same for 9/11? In 2101 will we have six year olds playing with 9/11 toys, playing on 9/11 Roblox servers? Makes you think.|2020-09-11 11:13:29

4tihgf|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|3|I‚Äôm fairly dumb when it comes to the pricing of options and wondering- how tf did I buy an at the money strike 12/18 call for RKT for $10.20 and now it‚Äôs worth $2.10. That‚Äôs fair. But why is the in the month strike for the same date wayyyy cheaper? RKT is currently sitting at $23.45 and it‚Äôs $4.15 for the $23 12/18 call right now. IV hasn‚Äôt changed that much... used to be at like 120% and now it‚Äôs at 87%. Is that enough to more than halve the price of these contracts? Would the premiums for these contracts go up if the stock made another run up again? And is that because of IV?

Now, "we recognize the crisis and this practice is unhealthy". A selloff occurs to take advantage of the foolish, younger, "Robinhood" investor generation.

4ugu2u|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|3|I just blew 2 day trades getting out of a position just to get back into it.  It sounds retarded because it is. Its because I was going to try to make a quick play, but apparently the way TDA handles your money when you're using newly added money is it prioritizes that pool, so I had shares and an option (the option bought with my settled cash). When I sold the option, I DIDN'T GET MY OPTION BUYING POWER BACK, instead it "paid off" the unsettled money pool with the settled money, meaning now I had to also sell my stock to get that money. Even worse, I couldn't even reenter my option position because my options buying power was zero. So I had to RESELL MY STOCK and then rebuy the option, and then rebuy the stock, because at that point the play I wanted to do was already obviously fucked and I wasn't going to attempt it.  So fucking stupid. Why the FUCK does TDA allow it to work like this? Its so backwards.|2020-09-11 12:56:54

4tl4hb|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|7|I don‚Äôt recall GSX pursuing legal action against muddy waters ü§î. NKLA is toast    (PRNewsfoto/Nikola Corporation)  "Yesterday, an activist short-seller whose motivation is to manipulate the market and profit from a manufactured decline in our stock price published a so-called "report" replete with misleading information and salacious accusations directed at our founder and executive chairman. To be clear, this was not a research report and it is not accurate. This was a hit job for short sale profit driven by greed.  We have nothing to hide and we will refute these allegations.  They have already taken up more time and attention than they deserve. We have retained leading law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP to evaluate potential legal recourse, including with respect to the activist short seller and any others acting in concert.  Nikola also intends to bring the actions of the activist short-seller, together with evidence and documentation, to the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.    We respect the rights of investors and the integrity of the market and will be back to you after we have advanced the process with the SEC.   Most importantly, Nikola remains focused on delivering on the promises we've made to our stakeholders."|2020-09-11 08:27:43

My biggest concern isn't that the stock will rise, it's that it'll plummet and my big green number will go up, but I won't know how to sell it to actually make the money, which happened the first time I was 'supposed' to profit from an option but it expired worthless.

4utf8m|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|2|Purple Innovation Founders Head for Exit -- Market Talk  PRPL $15P 9/18 next week: Two founding bros sold their remaining stake. And nope, not the Miltons. Yet. Marketwatch  The brothers who co-founded mattress maker Purple Innovation  complete their exit with the sale of their remaining 25.5% stake. A  secondary offering of about 11.8M Purple shares by InnoHold, owned by  brothers Terry and Tony Pearce, prices at $18.50 apiece, below  Wednesday's close of $20.14. An overallotment option of 1.77M shares  would drop InnoHold's stake to zero. The Pearce brothers, who brought  Purple public in a 2018 merger with a blank-check company, retired last  month. Purple shares down 2.7% premarket to $19.58.|2020-09-11 14:34:20

As anyone who has followed other short seller reports knows, the market tends to shrug them off unless there's smoking gun evidence.

4ufglz|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|1|Ok degenerates let me hear your thoughts.. If you buy shares of PSTH and hold through a merge you also get 2/9 of a warrant with it and the shares won‚Äôt go below $20 because if you don‚Äôt go with the merger they‚Äôll take them back for $20+interest-fees and your warrants will be divided amongst the remaining holders so you could potentially get more than 2/9 of a warrant. If Billy A pulls something off like Robinhood or Starlink it could have huge potential with what I am assuming is extremely minimal risk since $20 is the floor it‚Äôll drop to. What am I missing?

4ttuih|iqnsjz|iqnsjz|0|This happened just before Trevor founded NKLA. I was riding around on a Citibike in Phoenix and as I was docking the bike to reset my 45 minute timer, I saw Trevor curiously looking at the bikes. He noticed I put the bike in, used my key and got my bike back out.  He asked me ‚Äúhey man do you know how this works?‚Äù.  I was a bit too excited and accidentally called him Trev but he didn‚Äôt notice. I explained to him the basic rules of CitiBike but he kept acting like it was too complicated and didn‚Äôt make sense.  ‚ÄúSo why did you put the bike back in just to take it out?‚Äù he asked  I told him ‚Äúthat‚Äôs because of the timer I mentioned to you. You have to return the bike before the time is up to avoid extra charges. You‚Äôre free to reset the time by docking it again‚Äù  He looked quite puzzled and asked if he could use my bike to test it out.  I told him all he needs to do is use a card and he can just get his own bike.  He refused and said he just wanted to try it out, hot but the bike.  Getting kind of annoyed I was like ‚Äúdude it‚Äôs $3 for a bike‚Äù  He snapped back at me and said ‚Äúif it‚Äôs only $3 why won‚Äôt you let me use yours?‚Äù  I said fuck it what‚Äôs the worst that can happen? So I let him hop on my CitiBike. This fucking guy gets on and starts strolling away and suddenly fucking guns t. I‚Äôve never seen someone fast in my life.  I waited there for about 30 minutes but he never returned. I tried to call CitiBike and tell them what happened but they said allowing other people to use the bike is my responsibility.  After 45 minutes I got charged a late fee .. then again .. then a day fee ... the charges stopped but this morning I just woke up to a $1,200 charge on my account!! My credit card only has a $500 dollar limit but these fuckers somehow still charged me and now my credit usage is like 300%.  Also CitiBike banned my account so I lost lost my annual membership|2020-09-11 09:47:45
