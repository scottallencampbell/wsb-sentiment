If you see a relatively unknown stock getting shilled on WSB all of the sudden like VTIQW that has an insane trajectory, chances are the shills are wanting to get out of their position. In order to do so, they need liquidity and WSB provides all the ammo they need to leave you with their bags once the pump and dump is over.|2020-05-12 11:29:52

qdcdqg|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|8|CRM Call Holders- a little DD for the people who just follow in here  They missed earnings their last 2 quarters. Jan 2020 reported on 2/25/20. EPS .09 and consensus was 0.12.   October 2019- reported 12/3/19. EPS 0.15. Consensus 0.21  5 days before each earnings report the stock topped out and eventually bled down.   Since earnings is 5/28, more than likely the best move to dump sometime next week. This significant run up has me thinking to dump by the EOW though.

qdcy4o|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|6|CPI numbers are out. Big win for grocery stores, but here is the rest:   The energy index declined 10.1 percent in April, its largest monthly decrease since November 2008. The gasoline index continued to decline, falling 20.6 percent in April; it has declined 32.5 percent since December 2019. (Before seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices fell 16.5 percent in April.) The fuel oil index also declined in April, falling 15.6 percent. In contrast, the index for electricity increased slightly in April, rising 0.1 percent, and the index for natural gas rose 0.2 percent.   The energy index fell 17.7 percent over the past 12 months, its largest 12-month decline since the period ending September 2015. The gasoline index decreased 32.0 percent, while the fuel oil index fell 33.2 percent. The index for natural gas declined 1.9 percent, while the index for electricity increased slightly over the last 12 months, rising 0.2 percent.    All items less food and energy  The index for all items less food and energy decreased 0.4 percent in April. Large declines in several indexes contributed to the record decrease. The apparel index fell 4.7 percent in April. The index for motor vehicle insurance declined 7.2 percent, and the index for airline fares decreased 15.2 percent. Each of these decreases was the largest monthly decline in the history of the respective series.  The shelter index was unchanged in April, as it was in March. The indexes for rent and for owners‚Äô equivalent rent both increased 0.2 percent in April following 0.3-percent increases in March. However, these increases were offset by a sharp decline in the index for lodging away from home, which fell 7.1 percent in April following a 6.8-percent decline in March. Also falling in April were the indexes for used cars and trucks, which declined 0.4 percent, and for recreation, which declined 0.2 percent. The new vehicles index was unchanged in April after declining in March|2020-05-12 07:33:05
qde7oq|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|6|while I like to dump some of these run-ups before earnings (looking at you, CSCO), DKNG makes more sense to hold to me  there's not going to be anything new in the ER on 5/15 -- their entire stock rise has been based on forward valuation/projections, sports leagues re-opening, other states (who will be hurting for tax revenue) legalizing online gambling, etc.  unless they come out with news in the ER that their expansion plans failed/hit bumps (and most of this would already be known due to bills needing to be introduced to committee to allow online gambling), it's hard to see the ER in particular being a catalyst for a fall  could it run out of steam?  sure.  but this is one where I don't think the ER is going to do it .. convince me otherwise|2020-05-12 07:47:52

qeszyo|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|13|Lol at this country.  Best case scenario would have been shutting down hard for a few weeks as the virus showed up in February, then contract tracing and keeping the spread under control. Reopening after a brief lockdown, FUD is controlled, people feel safe, and economic fallout is mitigated.  Scenario B is no shutdown, keep plugging away like Sweden and economic fallout is limited, a lot of people get sick and die, but herd immunity is achieved by EOY.   Worst case scenario is what we opted for. Partial rolling shutdowns that cripple the economy and still allow the virus to rip across the country. Plenty of people still scared to leave the house, plenty of people railing out about their rights being violated. Nobody is right but nobody is entirely wrong either.|2020-05-12 14:51:39

While Germany, France, Spain, and Italy are partially reopening under very tight control, Germany is already seeing an uptick in cases.  With earnings season over as of this week, the euphoria is gone and we're standing on thin ice. Even tech won't be invincible with broader market exit.

qfcx2j|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|3|Thesis on this weekend: Market will drill pre-market Monday and potentially through next week   1. Market makers write billions in put options that they want to expire worthless (bullish until opex).   2. Market makers want to squeeze out every ounce of bull blood by short squeezing (bullish until opex).   3. Market makers will sell off positions once the puts expire worthless for GAINS 3 WAYS.   4. SPY struggling to reach 100 or 200dma.. ranges are contracting on stocks across the board which typically means a big move is coming. 5. We are around the 62% Fibonacci retracement and due for a sizable pullback  If I can get a good price on SPY puts before Friday i'm going all in|2020-05-12 17:31:13

qeb7wp|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|5|Also I posted this last night but here is some information on cruise lines.   Do not buy the hype.     IF ANYONE TELLS YOU TO INVEST IN CRUISE LINES...DON'T  I'm a cruiser and I'm telling you right now it's bullshit. Bookings are up because they are literally paying for me to cruise.  If I book right now on Carnival I get...  A free interior for as long as I want, 400$ in OBC, free drinks in the casino, and I could probably work in an upgrade.  MSC will give me a free balcony for as long as I want, free drinks anywhere on the boat, free shore excursion, and probably a few hundred in the casino.   THEY ARE PADDING bookings and writing as profit. THE INDUSTRY IS DEAD UNTIL THERE IS A VACCINE.  https://imgur.com/a/27X6hxS  - Proof|2020-05-12 12:31:47

Lucked out and picked august due to the spreads, at the time the spreads for future months got really wide.

qdugp1|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|2|Two best plays right now:  STNE  may 29 $29 strike call - stone co moved their earnings report to may 26. it was suppose to be today. they didn't get enough action in their stock so they want to come up with some hot news like novavax did the other day. right now its classic dump and it will get pumped by the end of the week and all week.  ADS may 22 $45 strike call. Nice dip today. Basically no action in the option market but by the end of the week and next week it will be all action. most tech companies finish reporting this week and next week is going to be mostly retial and energy which is not going to be good for the market. i would expect big players to move to this one. may 14th is the last day to get in this stock to qualify for dividends so this is a classic dump before they scoop up tomorrow since its very attractive dividend.   i feel sorry for any bears who buys puts in these two during today's dip.|2020-05-12 10:20:01

Auto makers are struggling and that report about Nissan having so many cars stuck at sea due to the fact the dealerships just aren‚Äôt moving enough and don‚Äôt have space is telling.   Footlocker puts for obvious reasons. Shoe supply line got shit on from China and their online footprint isn‚Äôt big.

qd9fjg|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|2|Serious question, there is a post saying there was a rally during 1929 that lasted 6 months, it was attributed to stimulus. Similiar to what we have now.

So wouldn't that make the whole comparison to 1930s bad?   Tldr: 2020 ‚â† 1930s(?)|2020-05-12 06:46:48

Hopped in with some shares because it's a penny stock, and then picked up a few LONG 9/18 and 12/18 $2.5c (dirt cheap as of just purchasing rn -> 0.05-0.1). As I was deliberating on pulling the trigger on some options, the 9/18 volume went from \~250 to 967. Seems like a nice lotto, but ya'll can do your own dd.

qe37w8|gi8h6c|gi8h6c|1|Quick Question if anyone can answer. Stupid Robhinhood UI.. I mis clicked trying to lock in my profits on a call buy turning it into a spread.   I had 2 $30 calls on VTIQ  I tried to sell 1 $35 call right at the top.  I accidentally sold 1 $35 call and BOUGHT a $40 call....  This is pretty much the same as me turning the $30 call into a 30/35 spread AND purchasing a $40 call right?  So really I did what I wanted to PLUS got a $40 call on accident, correct?  Thank you.  Any other platform this would be fine, just wondering if this is gonna cause me issues on robin hood.|2020-05-12 11:30:22
