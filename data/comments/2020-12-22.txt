gokj01|ki3745|ki3745|10|FWIW Ryan Cohen's average cost on 9M GME shares is $8.40.  IMO he's looking for at least triple return so buying shares at anything less than $25.20 is viable.  (Previously his cost basis on 6.5M GME shares was $5.98, so I considered $18 a potential profit taking ceiling)  (And if you ask how I got the triple return assumption, I pulled it out of my ass of course)|2020-12-22 05:06:39

He's your wife's boyfriend.

gq58xs|ki3745|ki3745|18|I know this may be anathema to many people here but check this out. Although there are many retards here, I’m one of them, collectively we may be smarter than any of those Wall Street Idiots.  Just read Matthew Frankel from Motley Fool.  His premise is that GM is the next great EV stock because of its brand name and partnership with NKLA.  My fellow autists called him out immediately because we know it’s bullshit.  We know he’s a GM stockholder who is just trying to pump his shitty GM shares. We know the GM Brand name is really a negative to anyone under 70 and there is no way GM can miraculously pivot to EV.   Here is my premise why we’re more powerful than any investment firm on Wall Street.  1.  The Wisdom of Crowds.  Individually we may be lazy porn addicted, gambling degenerates, who couldn’t get a date in a whorehouse while collectively, we are focused on only one thing, trendies.  We are not, most of us, trying to get our clients to go for the safe dividend play.  We are trying to make money, lots of it, fast, so we can quit our shitty job at Wendy’s.  2. We have nothing but time on our hands to do research, some of its good, some of it garbage, but we put the information out there to be picked apart. We’re not going to waste time on bullshit meetings because no one will invite us to the bullshit meetings because we have neck beards and body odor.  2.  We are not afraid to make mistakes. We glorify our losses because we don’t care about being fired or our clients pulling their money.  By being public about our losses our fellow autists can learn from mistakes made and avoid them.  You can only get better by admitting to errors, correcting them, and making better decisions in future.  Our opponents make excuses, pass blame, and try to defend what they already have.    3. We are anonymous so we can be as stupid as possible without repercussions.  This prevents fear of failure because who cares if we say or post something idiotic.  No one we really know really knows us.   4. We know we’re already losers therefore we have nothing to lose.  YOLO is the only way to go.  5.  Memes are funny and even though we may lose all our money  we will receive a great dopamine rush from the creatives on here that entertain us even though we lost our rent money on  a NKLA yolo.    That’s it for now. Thanks for reading, good luck, and fuck you.|2020-12-22 14:29:49

They Fed also said they can engage in limited stock buybacks  beginning in Q1. 4. Their shares are lower priced than Goldman Sachs. 5. SPACS are creating a fertile environment for M&A. 6. US equities becoming a global store of value. 7. There will likely be more high priced IPOs in 2021. 8. I'm bullish on the 2021 equities market because covid conditions are shifting money flows from small businesses to public companies.

gplxnh|ki3745|ki3745|6|GME has a relatively small market cap at 1.3B relative to the gaming industry. Yes I understand this is due to their business model and brick and mortar stores. But for the sake of imagination if Gamestop achieves a pathway to something digital, a reasonable adjusted market cap is 13B; translating to $250 per share. And that's on the low end  This reminds me the pivot AMD took from $2 to near $100 today in just a few years. Different scenarios but you get the gist|2020-12-22 11:46:53

It went up on pure speculation that Apple will need to find LIDAR supplier. No one knows who that is or will be. It might be VLDR, LAZR or another company entirely.

No more!  My bullish thesis:  The SPY has been arguably flat since the beginning of December and it took nearly a year to recover to previous ATH. Using our current knowables, we can easily calculate that 2020 has been roughly 3 years long.  The average market correction lasts only 5 months.  (12\*3)/5 = 7.2, clearly outlining a current market upside of over \~eats crayon\~ 720%!       tldr; spy $2642 2021 get in|2020-12-22 13:40:40

I checked that the CEO of SoFi is  Anthony Noto, who was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs. And guess what? Goldman Sachs has one SPAC available: **$GSAH** . It is around $10.7 right now. I put a few thousand dollars. One concern is SoFi is Softbank-backed and Softbank recently proposed to create a SPAC.... So it might be a little risky.... I don't know details much but felt like a good deal. It's cheap so why not?|2020-12-22 12:14:08

It’s still in testing phase and we’re looking for volunteers willing to be test subjects and possibly be the first inoculated.  The test is not very invasive, but does require sperm to be shot directly onto the face and into the eyes. Side effects so far are a slight burning sensation, clouded vision and in one case permanent blindness. This case is considered to be a one off due to the closeness of the blast. We are recommending subjects be back at least 6” from ejection site to avoid repeat occurrences.  As always, contact your local Wendy’s for further details.

gp9vut|ki3745|ki3745|2|AAPL hit piece   Apple iCar Is a Terrible Idea. Here's Why. -- Barrons.com  12/22/20, 4:57 PM Tech behemoth Apple is apparently resurrecting plans to make a car. It's, frankly, an odd idea. But some see risks for Tesla and other auto makers.  Here's what Apple (ticker: AAPL), Tesla (TSLA) and automotive investors need to know about a potential car from the world's most valuable company. (And why it's a lousy idea.)  First, Fun With Numbers  Volkswagen (VOW.Germany) is the largest auto maker in the world by unit volume. The company delivered almost 11 million vehicles in the pre-pandemic year of 2019.  Volkswagen has spent almost $180 billion on plant and equipment over the past decade. Apple, on the other hand, has spent about $100 billion. The car business is big and requires a lot of capital, and manufacturing scale, to succeed.|2020-12-22 10:04:04

gp8lgg|ki3745|ki3745|-2|This is a repost but an important PSA for diamond hand gang:  * Yes, There is a strong support at $0/share but due to TSLA’s debt I doubt it holds. It may bounce off it for 1-2 weeks before a dramatic drop to around negative $500-1,000/share. How can a stock be worth less than $0 you ask? The taker/holder of the share is now responsible for the companies debt spread out to over all outstanding shares. Any newbs out there, do not forget this! You do not want to take on any company’s debt by holding their shares below $0/share. I’ve seen countless bankruptcies and ruined credit scores after brave diamond hands held their shares to the depths of hell relentlessly take on collection agencies. Luckly most will never experience this as your broker will automatically sell your shares at $0 by default. You have to manually turn that feature off. God speed everyone*|2020-12-22 09:52:40

gp72z2|ki3745|ki3745|0|There's only a couple reasons I can think of why QS is rising:  1) QS is apparently a candidate for a short squeeze but there was only about 10% short interest  2) PIPE restrictions went out on the 18th. Maybe the institutional investors locked in some gains for their clients, or they're increasing their stake into the company, either of which would create upward pressure on the stock price  3) Buying EV is a faux pas and it's all about getting into a company that's pure speculation at this point, like TSLA was back in 2016.  Either way, wish I didn't sell my calls earlier this month. Got out at the previous high and I was hoping it'd drop back down to the 40s before buying more.  FUBO's rise makes a little more sense but if you've seen the subscription cost, it's most costly than just streaming ESPN and having DraftKings app in front of you.|2020-12-22 09:39:15

gp279y|ki3745|ki3745|-4|I just sold out of $ICLN not sure what the hype is when its still getting freezing in the winters. Apart from mountains with volcanos in them and ones with religious signfiicance, I dont see why we can't just move there if its really becoming a problem. Mountains are cold because snow comes from there. I know environmentalists have a problem with that I am not super sure why, I didn't think hipsters liked to ski and we can always generate snow like those people from Dubai did. No wonder they live in the desert... And then everyone in Taronga Zoo like the meerkats and other Desert Dwellers could be air conditioned but theres not much other problems, You could use the water like a wheel to power our new floarting cities, if the politicans stopped saying how bad our society is and instead concentrated on the goodthings. But all they want to talk about is problems instead of solutions like Dangerous Dan and his weak constitution. I dont know how anyone can think that its about there anything that we could begin to think that something like that apart from the situation cannot really elucidate the process of deep paths towards a newer idea. Theres not much that anyone can do to stop the future really, thats why I dont try to teach my children about these kind of crap like they learning in the schools and I even talked to the teacher but she wouldnt listen and just kept talking about the syllabus and curriculum and writing on the chalk board for some reason even though I could hear what she was saying. I'm very gifted but the most gifted thing about me is I know when to quit and even though I'm deep in the red on this one I'm gonna get out, the stock market always keeps going day by day never stopping without any humans or even some sort of animals too.|2020-12-22 08:53:50
