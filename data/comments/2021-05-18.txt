yjx4gl|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|67|Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the way. Nasdaq up about 0.75%. S&P 500 and Dow about 0.3% to the good. That’s as of 0620.  This follows a day of modest losses on Wall Street. Losses narrowed into the close and apparently that has kept up overnight.  On the economic data front today, we have housing starts and building permits for April, out at 0830. Estimates call for 1.75 million new permits, roughly in line with March. The question is if we beat February’s 15-year high of 1.89 million.   You don’t need me to tell you that this will bring more talk of inflation. That could hurt tech. I’ve been active in tech shares but you’ll have to listen to the audio to get that information.  Earnings today: Home Depot just beat estimates. Waiting on Macy’s and Walmart.|2021-05-18 05:30:51

Keep your losses a secret from family and friends, that way when you get a big win you can surprise them!  Money isn't real, so borrow as much as you need to break even.  Studies show that gambling is a great way to deal with loneliness and stress, stave away sadness, and even blow off steam. Drink alcohol. Get high.|2021-05-18 05:57:26

ykaq7c|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|7|Despite high demand housing starts fell super heavy. Massively increased materials prices created shortages that have boosted prices to levels that are now stymying the construction industry. Calls on home prices?  Lumber futures have fallen over 25% in the past week. Is this the legendary cyclical demand glut fizzling while the available supply surges?  Possibly, but not likely. It’s more likely that people aren’t starting new projects and haven n’t been for awhile. In progress projects will pay those high prices because you end up losing money when half built stuff sits. Most summer seasons are bad for building material demand anyway, which is probably only exacerbating the drop.  I’m not bold enough to put a price on where lumber futures will stabilize, but for the sake of my calls I’m going to say. “Soon”. Lumber companies are making bank when the price is above 400, let alone 1700. Many will find profit margins take a significant hit when it does fall to 400 though, the extra capacity lines they bring on during periods of high demand have higher marginal costs.   I’m still wagering these companies are fairly undervalued due to the overall high sustained demand for more housing in suburban and rural areas, especially considering supply conditions in general, and I believe the shift to remote work, and the houses people will want, is going to keep demand higher than expected for several years.   I’m also hoping it solves gentrification in cities, but I mean hey. I’ll just keep buying calls.|2021-05-18 07:57:25

yjwmnp|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|5|So there's a confusion out there I'd like to clear up  MGM  AMZN looking buying MGM HOLDINGS (A studio company)- NOT a public company  It is NOT MGM the casinos-Public Company  They are 2 separate  companies and have no relationship  If you buy MGM (which I own and think is a good buy) you ARE NOT getting in front of that potential sale. It is meaningless to them  It's not even easy to search for cause the casino MGM overwhelms the results  Best of luck|2021-05-18 05:23:56

Dominates e-commerce, dominates cloud services, massively growing ad business, runs a highly successful grocery, the top user content streaming service and top 5 TV streaming service, expanding into pharma distribution, all wrapped in a recurring revenue subscription model with an unmatched logistics network (also a service), and hired over half a million people in the middle of a pandemic with 75k more announced to boot.  How it’s not the highest valued company I do not understand - still growing 40% YoY and will likely hit a trillion in revenue within 5 years from an increasingly diversified and profitable model.

yjzw0c|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|49|Daily reminder about AMC  Trading at x20 the market cap ***pre***pandemic on NO BULL NEWS.  There is no innovation, no merger, no acquisition, no new technology, no theatre construction, no theatre renovation, no plan to revive theatre interest in the USA (on a HUGE demographic decline over 10ys), no change in leadership, no replacing lost revenue streams from permanently closed theatres, no new subscription models...  Nothing.  They are changing... **nothing**.  Retail is holding some 80-90% of the shares, bullish? WRONG. There's a fundamental reason that institutions aren't *investing*, but short interest has been **increasing**.  The share price is OVER VALUE.  The company BARELY survived the pandemic, almost all of their competitors went bust. How did AMC survive? By being a valuable and irreplaceable service?   # NO  By diluting the fuck out of the stock. Thats why, despite ALL the buying pressure behind AMC... it didn't move above the 20s. Because the fucking company took your money and said "thanks, idiots."  The market IS irrational. Yes. But all companies return to fundamentals *eventually*. When the AMC bubble bursts, don't be left holding the bag.  Get in quick. Get out quicker.|2021-05-18 06:06:57

yl446m|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|15|Hourly reminder for GME holders to EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE.  The vote was the ONLY CATALYST.  Everything else was nonsense, the whole time. The vote is the single most inarguable source of information about the positions behind GME.  IF it is rejected, then the company will issue a share recall. THIS is the **only** catalyst that ever existed. Mark Cuban explicitly said this during his AMA.  VOTING TAKES 5 MINUTES.   Do it when you next take a shit.|2021-05-18 11:30:30

yk0xja|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|11|LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have lost $930 million on their short positions in meme stocks GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) over the last five trading days, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday.        Shares in GameStop(GME), which was at the heart of the so-called "stonks" retail trading mania earlier this year, have risen by a third in the last one week, while shares in cinema operator AMC are up 39%.        Ortex said short interest in AMC is currently estimated to be 18.3% of freefloat and in GME it is estimated at 21.8% of freefloat.        Yesterday alone, short-sellers lost over $200 million each in both of those stocks, Ortex data shows. GameStop(GME) closed 13% higher at $180.6, the highest level since April 30.   &#x200B;  STONKS|2021-05-18 06:19:37

Recognizing the potential for Valor Glass to help deliver COVID-19 vaccines, the U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) granted Corning $204 million to ramp up manufacturing of Valor vials. Even as scientists seek to discover a vaccine for COVID-19, vial-filling and -finishing capacity is currently constrained. But Valor Glass vials may help. Use of Valor Glass vials in the vaccine-packaging process can help increase overall filling and finishing capacity. GLW🦍🤓🚀🚀🚀|2021-05-18 10:19:33

yktj9d|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|3|Yes, it's true. I fart in an office that I share with other people. However, our office is divided into cubicles making it possible for me to exercise some of my creative ingenuity to mitigate the effects of my noxious gas on my coworkers to a degree that they are not able to detect odor at all. Here's how it works: after farting, I bring my face down to the same level at which the fart gas was released. Then, I lick my index finger and hold it up to detect the direction of the wind. Next, I inhale a mouthful of my fart gas, then turn to the direction opposite of the wind and exhale heavily to redirect the gas in the opposite direction. I repeat and continue all the fart has be neutralized. So, as you can see, there IS a safe and effective way to fart in the office without disturbing coworkers. You just need a little ingenuity :)|2021-05-18 10:18:12

May 21 has 360,000. Of which over 200,000 are in the money already. Most of the rest can get called as well if it hits $20. That would be almost 1 billion in stock that could be called if it gets the treatment this week. I feel there is a chance for some 💎 🙌 to pay back wallstreet for the last few weeks.

ykkuwn|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|-6|Has anyone had a look into FLWS as a potential short squeeze target?  The company is actually positioned super well post pandemic. They've received headwinds because people assume the service only grew during lockdown, but I think its stickier.   Those headwinds caused a massive short interest to build up in the stock with 29% of float sold short.  The short ratio is super high at 7.8, so when the pressure builds this thing will fly.   MKT Cap is only 2B so its not impossible to move the price.  Thoughts?|2021-05-18 09:17:34

Still up on the day, holding gains for fifth straight day and six of last seven.     This stock does not have to be a scalp trade. The growth the company is enjoying is simply SPECIAL. With Pfizer as a top customer the revenue for Covid doses and follow up boosters will continue for a long time. AND, with economies opening the historical treatments for Malaria, Flu, HIV and so many others will be back in full force.     So enjoy the ride. If you're scalping, great.

Some may have risen in value because they announced a strategic partnership, or has new executives, etc. What should I look for? **I know that I should avoid 'chronic' reasons for gain, such as the announcement of a merger.**  * Should I pay attention to the 1-year price range?

ylyelg|nf6oeg|nf6oeg|0|I'm trying to understand if OZOP has long term value.  Please comments.     They are connecting solar to their neogrid on commercial real estate and making a huge amount with arbitrage ...       This system is designed to arbitrage electricity under agreement with the utility where we store several megawatts of energy at night and release it during high demand daytime hours for a premium. The value of this installation is several million dollars with the income based on variable rates at various peak times.       https://www.powermag.com/press-releases/ozop-energy-ozsc-obtains-site-control-for-battery-storage-project/|2021-05-18 14:54:47
