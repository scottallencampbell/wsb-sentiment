9q1scy|e6fpmg|e6fpmg|6|I know no one will see this but I've been doing some thinking about the Saudi Aramco IPO. I get why they're doing it but as someone who works in O&G it's hard to say why exactly.   My suspicion is that for right now they want to keep oil prices relatively high to maximize the money they raise from the IPO. Then they will increase production to drive oil back down into the 30s, which will essentially collapse the North American Shale players. There's no a single one of them that can really survive another big dip. There will be a massive wave of bankruptcies and basically a fire sale on equipment and acreage. I imagine SA will take their pick of the litter alongside the other Majors.   Something of this size (half a trillion dollars? Ish) would likely kickstart a pretty decent recession once you get all the oil workers, truckers, plus the decrease in NA output leading to a higher price of oil (back in the 80s) that now OPEC and the majors can essentially totally control, leading to higher gas prices, leading to reduced consumer spending/travel/etc.   I could see this being a big negative for the USA.|2019-12-05 07:46:31

9rcgdq|e6fpmg|e6fpmg|6|Just gonna leave this here... Lets see employment numbers tomorrow   Throughout the 1920s, the U.S. economy expanded rapidly, and the nation‚Äôs total wealth more than doubled between 1920 and 1929, a period dubbed ‚Äú[the Roaring Twenties](http://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties).‚Äù  The stock market, centered at the [New York](https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/new-york) Stock Exchange on Wall Street in [New York City](https://www.history.com/topics/new-york-city), was the scene of reckless speculation, where everyone from millionaire tycoons to cooks and janitors poured their savings into stocks. As a result, the stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929.  By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stock prices much higher than their actual value. Additionally, **wages at that time were low, consumer debt was proliferating,** the agricultural sector of the economy was struggling due to drought and falling food prices and banks had an excess of large loans that could not be liquidated.  The American economy entered a mild recession during the summer of 1929, as consumer spending slowed and unsold goods began to pile up, which in turn slowed factory production. Nonetheless, stock prices continued to rise, and by the fall of that year had reached stratospheric levels that could not be justified by expected future earnings.|2019-12-05 13:32:57

This is ignoring the fact that people don‚Äôt just exercise to lose weight, she could have just been an unhealthy slob who couldn‚Äôt run a mile to save her life just like an overweight person. There is a big difference between a skinny unhealthy person and a skinny healthy person, yes, enough to change your life as the woman suggested. However all they could see was weight. A skinny woman trying to get skinnier. All for her pig husband. But after all that, Peleton just said, ‚Äú Sorry you guys didn‚Äôt get it. No ragrets XD.‚Äù Good shit.

9qgk6r|e6fpmg|e6fpmg|1|I've got a weird one for you guys. Anyone have an ETF/ETN that allows you to short GCC currencies that are pegged to the dollar? Contracts against the peg are probably dirt cheap, but if there a 1/100 chance of one of them not being able to maintain their peg for some reason it should make a killing. But it's gotta be retail feasible. I suppose you could just short an ETF of OPEC countries, but I'd rather have limited downside.|2019-12-05 09:46:00
