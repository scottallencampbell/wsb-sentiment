v6u5of|mumzmy|mumzmy|41|The Consumer Product Safety Commission video of the recent PTON treadmill accident is brutal.      The child is fine, just terrified. Most treadmills have a "pressure" sensor that will stop turning when it feels too much resistance. With the PTON tread sitting a few inches higher and what looks like no "pressure" sensor, the treadmill will just pull harder and increase torque when it feels resistance. Great for high intensity sprints, but this leads to small kids, animals, and toys getting sucked underneath the treadmill.        Child is fine. Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y    Puts on PTON. No unsupervised kiddos in your gyms!|2021-04-20 06:23:22

v6sdlk|mumzmy|mumzmy|15|Stocks are set to open lower today, with futures pointing to a drop of about 0.5% for major indexes. Small caps are off even more, with the Russell 2000 down 0.8%. That’s as of 0645 and follows a day of selling across the board.  There appears to be some profit taking going on after a strong week last week when the Dow and S&P closed at records.  We did get disappointing earnings from United Airlines yesterday and this is of course a proxy for the pandemic reopening trade. Almost all other major earnings reports have beaten estimates.  At the time of this writing, more reports came in with J&J beating on earnings and revenues. We’re due to hear from a bunch of other blue chips today, including Lockheed Martin, Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and Netflix.  Nothing in terms of economic data releases today, but we are getting a bit of a surge in daily reported COVID cases in the U.S. that could be weighing on markets as well.

v77gt7|mumzmy|mumzmy|16|$MVIS  One argument I keep seeing against this stock is that it already ran 3000% or whatever over a year. This company was struggling during Covid with product partners pulling out of deals. They have been spending money developing their best-in-class lidar over several years. The company was and still is being shorted into the ground for not having much revenue.  The same shit was being pulled with GME, except because MVIS is a smaller company, shorts could really go to town and drag the share price into the dirt. The share price last year was NOT indicative whatsoever of the value of this company.  Their lidar technology is ahead of any other lidar manufacturer (and yet MVIS has the lowest market cap), their technology is in Hololens2 (~$22billion army deal) and they have a fuck ton of patents (AR/VR & AV). Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, they all need their tech and MVIS is up for sale.  The real value of MVIS is signifcantly higher than the current share price indicates and MVIS is ready this year to show what they got. Shorts better get out or they will get burnt hard.  TLDR: Fuck shorts man.|2021-04-20 08:36:26

v8gytw|mumzmy|mumzmy|11|**Personal thoughts on AAPL event:**  **Air Tags:** at $30 these are going to sell like hotcakes and will ultimately be a part of most iPhone user's lives... think of how many that is...  **Podcast subscriptions:** Brand new revenue stream for AAPL. Uncertain how this will work out for them, and I am unconvinced as yet... still it adds to their bottom line however.  **Expanded Apple Card Eligibility:** Great move by AAPL. This can only increase profits.  **New iMac:** The M1 chip is a monster and they can squeeze extra performance out of it by applying more power in a desktop configuration. Colours? I don't give a shit... but there are a lot of people that do. MANY people have been waiting for an Apple Silicon iMac since Apple Silicon was announced last year... floodgates are going to open on orders.  **Apple TV 4K:** Decent performance and functionality update, but the real star of the show is the new Siri Remote. I think folks underestimate how much the previous version was despised by the Apple community. These are going to fly off the shelves.  **iPad Pro XDR:** This is an amazing update, but I think it is limited to more of a niche market. Will be substantially eclipsed in sales by the smaller version, which will do very well at that price point. M1 chip inclusion COULD have enabled them to run macOS Big Sur on it which would be a total game changer, allowing you to run Mac apps on it. We could very well see this in the future.  **Purple iPhone:** Who gives a fuck? Very niche.  All-in-all this is a very solid lineup and I am extremely bullish on the company moving forward, especially with the new top-tier iMacs and MacBooks coming later this year based on the much anticipated M1x Apple Silicon chip manufactured by TSMC.|2021-04-20 13:57:07

For my port, the market was trading sideways the past few weeks and now it's dumping even harder. FML.  Ofc, all the "I told you so" folks in r/stocks would tell me something like, "Well, that's why you should have fallen in line and rotated out."

v81a67|mumzmy|mumzmy|2|Convince me that this YOLO idea is really fucking stupid.  * AGG (aggregate bond market) overall trending down, no surprise there, interest rates are rising. * Long-dated put options on AGG are HELLA CHEAP.  We're talking 6-8% IV. * Every sign points to economy overheating and interest rates are projected to continue rising this year.  Just this past week we've seen like 4 FP posts here about people bragging about their stupid ass 20:1 leveraged ETF strats (they think borrowing a fuckton literally can't go tits up).  The last point is just the retail microcosm of the broader credit bubble.  There's too much liquidity and nowhere intelligent to put it.  Yes JPow will continue his policy but interest rates will continue to steadily rise likely anyway.  When company, retail, and fund defaults increase this will put even more strain on rates.|2021-04-20 12:10:13

v86blc|mumzmy|mumzmy|2|What does everyone think of BAC?  It appears BAC is pulling ahead of other Financial Institutions amid the pandemic, but BAC just hit a 13 year profit high of $8.1 billion net income.  This caused it's Earnings Per Share to raise from 40c to 86c.  This is paired with a new $25billion buyback program.    [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-stock-jumps-toward-13-year-high-after-profit-beat-new-25-billion-buyback-program-2021-04-15](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-stock-jumps-toward-13-year-high-after-profit-beat-new-25-billion-buyback-program-2021-04-15) .    &#x200B;  Now that's regular news that I came across as it showed up on my feed.  The interesting part is that stock has taken a weird hit over the past week.  As of April 7, the stock was at over $40.  This trend over the past year shows that a slight dip in the stock is immediately followed by a sharp uptick.  It could honestly go back up by the end of the week.  &#x200B;  I'm buying now since I think 37.5 will be the lowest it goes in a while.|2021-04-20 12:45:10

v7skzp|mumzmy|mumzmy|4|Good spot to watch on SPY is the 9 EMA at 411.80ish. If we keep rejecting that its likely going to start making its way down to test the 20 EMA around 406.20.  Also we have a big gap to fill between 401 and 403. So if we get a nice rally and retake the 9 EMA loading up on puts at a 403 strike 2 months out would be solid. Markets tend to not like leaving gaps open for too long.  We are testing the 9 ema right now, even if we get above I wouldn't dump your longer puts just yet especially if you bought them friday. Nice protection to flip some calls on rallies.|2021-04-20 11:10:26

v7jkn0|mumzmy|mumzmy|2|JFC you paper handed soy boys.  Grow a pair of balls. This is why you shouldn't buy FDs.  Crying over a minor period of consolidation when last Friday there was a monster move.  Stonks don't only go up.  The market is looking for any news as a reason to deflate - russia, covid going back up, etc. One hiccup or blemish will cause a sell off.   Be a biatch and get scared or btfd. You can always buy damn shares during stupid kangaroo periods like this to avoid options all together when there is no clear direction.|2021-04-20 10:07:15
v7jngq|mumzmy|mumzmy|2|Got AAPL and the rest is in cash because no one seems to have a good idea of where COVID is going right now.  The US Government guidance is a wreck: the CDC says it’s safe to fly, even internationally, if fully vaccinated. But when you’re in the store you should wear a mask and socially distance. And then you have Fauci who says he wouldn’t eat indoors even after being fully vaccinated. Michigan is a train wreck. You have the Government shutting down the J&J vaccine over a handful of patients with clots which has further hardened the 35% of our nation that is anti-vaccine.  India is a train wreck. The third world, where vaccination has yet to begin meaningfully, is a reservoir for infection and mutation that could eventually lead to a variant that bypasses vaccines.   I booked some trips abroad for October and November, and I look at those trips as unlikely to pan out. Inter-EU travel opens in July and it’s hard to see the EU allowing Americans in 8-12 weeks later. Especially when anyone who travels will be fearing a change in testing and quarantine requirements of their home and destination counties during the trip. As it stands, international travel is FUBAR.|2021-04-20 10:07:49

Buy now, sell half Monday before earnings, the other half after eps smash .77/share.   Estimates are low, cause analysts think no s/x sales will kill margin. It’s not gonna have that much effect tho, bc last quarter’s auto gross margin was artificially deflated by investments in 3/y production streamlining and factory retooling. Plus, more zev credits this quarter, plus deferred tax. EPS gonna be over a dolla.   So go get yourself a dollar.  This is not legal advice.|2021-04-20 13:13:12

"This is somewhat in line with TSLA’s early trading multiples (forward five-year basis) and about in line with average multiples from the start-up EV OEM universe, which reflects the still nascent stage of the EV industry and fierce competitive landscape among incumbents/entrants," notes analyst John Murpy and team. * Shares of Fisker are up 4.69% premarket to $12.95.|2021-04-20 07:16:22
