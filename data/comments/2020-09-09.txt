4jb6an|ipd82q|ipd82q|106|In Jan 1982, The Vancouver Stock Exchange launched their own index (VSE), an average of the \~1500 companies being traded. It was set to an initial value of 1000.   However, even though North America was amidst a great bull market and the market seemed to be doing well, the index mysteriously kept dropping, and closed at 524.811 in November 1983.   Every time a stock value changed, which happened \~3000 times a day, the index value was recalculated and updated. This calculation produced a value with 4 decimal points, but the reported version of the index used only 3.   Instead of rounding (like SPY does), VSE just dropped the 4th digit. The index kept dropping because truncation meant the value was always rounded down, whereas rounding would have made sure it was rounded up as often as down.  Over the weekend of  November 25-28, the correct value of the index was calculated and the index jumped overnight from the incorrect 524.811 to the recalculated 1098.892, the highest % gain in the history of any index.   Imagine buying calls before that weekend.  [https://www5.in.tum.de/\~huckle/Vancouv.pdf](https://www5.in.tum.de/~huckle/Vancouv.pdf)|2020-09-09 06:17:09

If your options that you bought lost 20% of it's value, it doesn't gain back it's value by rising 20% - it does by rising 25%  The mathematical relationship between losses and gains is a reciprocal one.   Needed % gain to restore loss:  `[1 / (1 - % Loss)] - 1`  Example - to claw back from a 10% loss:  `[1 / (1 - .10)] - 1 = .1111 or 11.11%`  **Chart of gains and loss recovery**  LossGain Required :-:- \-5%5.3% \-10%11.1% \-15%17.6% \-20%25% \-25% 33.3% \-30%42.9% \-35%53.8% \-40%66.7% \-45%81.8% \-50%100%|2020-09-09 07:34:40

4jdad1|ipd82q|ipd82q|41|You guys wanna know some interesting gambling arbitrage situations from the past?  In 1990s, dog racing betting software in some Las Vegas casinos could be gamed so you could place bets after the race had finished.  The software was adapted from horse racing software and kept track of when to stop taking new bets (horses/dogs entering gates), start, and results posted, in hours and minutes, since horse races always take more than a minute.   However, dog races can be over in seconds, and it's possible to go from "close all bets" to "results posted" in less than a minute. Let's say all bets closed at 09:42:03 and results were posted at 09:42:51. Since the software only kept track of hours and minutes, both these time would show up as 09:42. Hence, you could place bets on the winning dog at 09:42:55 and make literally free money.  [https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/13/36](https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/13/36)|2020-09-09 06:48:50

4jija6|ipd82q|ipd82q|12|Alright nerds, while you constantly chase trends and are 2 steps behind MM, let me fuck you up with some actual DD with a less than 1-year payday.   ATHX set to break out definitively in the next 4-6 months. Their Japanese partner, Healios, is on track to complete P3 studies for both ARDS and Ischemic Stroke by the end of Q4. Data from previous trials looks like a grand slam for both compared with current standard of care.  Japanese government is VERY favorable toward regenerative medicine and there is a clear path to conditional approval in Q1 2021. [They treated the last patient of a 5 patient cohort of Covid-specific ARDS on Aug 12.](https://twitter.com/athersys/status/1293567745368436737) Their first primary readout data is set for 28 days post-treatment, which is September 10. It could be a few weeks for this data to get analyzed and released, but it seems clear that BIG things are coming before Q2 next year. I'm not sure it can be overstated how much of an impact this product can have on the world...stroke absolutely ruins lives and comes with a lifelong disability sentence. Do a little more DD on this company and their product (MultiStem) if you're curious. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of medical indications that it will revolutionize (GvHD, trauma, improving quality of donated organs)  I have worked on this product at my previous job and I am 100% sold on it. Looking at shares alone to be a 50 bagger over the next 3-5 years when its potential is fully realized. Japanese approval in 2021, USA approval on track for late 2021/early 2022, DoD funded clinical trial on Trauma to be completed 2022. So many catalysts both short and long term. Options are harder because of timing uncertainty, but any Jan calls should print and DEFINITELY any April. Will continue to buy more every chance I get, especially since this stock has been so savagely beaten down recently. Been investing in them since Mar 2019, avg cost $1.38/share until I FOMO'd in hard during their April pump this year. An expensive and painful lesson to a green investor, but the underlying thesis is unchanged and why I continue to buy more. Cheers and let's get rich, you retards.

In 1918, in the midst of the greatest war ever fought, he convinced the British Treasury to send him to Paris, where he scooped up priceless works by Degas and Cezanne at an art auction for both himself and the government. He got even better prices when German artillery less than 80 miles away started to shell Paris, making some auction-goers leave in panic.   He then returned to England, leaving his own Cezanne painting (which was valued at $41.6 million in 2013) under a hedge on a rural road for his friend to pick up because he got tired of carrying it.|2020-09-09 08:05:50

4kokp6|ipd82q|ipd82q|4|I really gotta stop playing TSLA... When you look into the return potential on weekly's its not even close to other opportunity ...$750 into tesla 9/11's would get you a 370c. Currently at 355 with a 10% move  if your lucky call it 390 or 2k in intrisic value maybe 3k over all tomorrow.     750 could also get you 10+  WMT 145c currently at 70ish each.. with a 10% move you get near 156 or $11 intrinsic value 1100 EACH! x 10 purchased... $11,000     &#x200B;  Those of you looking for a DUMB weekly FD... don't play tesla, If MSFT and WMT announce tick tock you got an easy 10 bagger right there.|2020-09-09 14:02:20

4jaeyr|ipd82q|ipd82q|10|Bears are just the worst kind of people. Instead of just profiting from what was an obvious correction and pulling out. They go around saying that everything is catching up with us, corona is coming back, too many unemployed, and in general that the world is ending. And then call for spy 300 or lower. 👌   Sure, ignore all of the uptrends. Things are recovering. The question is the speed, not if it’s happening. And when interest rates are zero, and money is being printed stocks are worth more than pre pandemic. 🌈 🐻 are the worst|2020-09-09 06:04:47

If you hear Democratic politicians start complaining that the stimulus bill does not contain direct payments to individuals, then they've walked into the trap and stimmies become much more likely.   I can explain why if anyone wants to know, but for now just listen for criticism that the 300 billion stimmy does not contain individual payments.|2020-09-09 10:05:02

It's no different today with options now driving the market. Having to buy 100 shares to cover the options drives the price of the share of because of demand, which then inflates etf and index funds that also hold the underlying asset. It also tells the algos that "Hey, this stock is having higher volume, let's hammer the ask to not miss out because large caps don't fail like penny stocks."  You do that on a large enough scale like SoftBank, and you see how bad they can fuck up the market. This market has nothing go for it.|2020-09-09 10:54:29

4kwo7m|ipd82q|ipd82q|2|I bought a TSLA 350c yesterday and was down over $800 and held it overnight. On some miracle it went over 350 premarket today and I was back in the game. TSLA started going down a little after open so I ended up panic selling for a $10 gain and then missed out on hundreds in potential gains later on throughout the day.   I can’t explain my behavior. I was down $800 last night and didn’t care, but as soon at it was back in the game this morning I got scared shitless and didn’t want to lose what would have been a minuscule amount compared to that $800 and exited ASAP. If I was down so much already, why should I have cared so much about losing significantly less money?|2020-09-09 15:08:40

Don’t let that surprise you or even shake you. It’s going to happen. You have to zoom out and look at the bigger picture here and see that it is still immensely positive to be climbing like this this morning, and it’s still bolds well for a stronger close.

4kgo0a|ipd82q|ipd82q|-3|Hello all!   I’m caught in a weird dilemma where I have $500 at play that is down to $460 after 10 days in the market and I have another $500 coming in tomorrow. This leaves me wanting TSLA to keep nose diving for a nice buy on sale before praying for some moon shots heading into battery day and possibly S&P inclusion. How do you all deal with this situation? Why does Robinhood make me wait 4-5 days for my deposit to be invest-able? I’m happy some of you are getting some green candles today, I hope this money brings your great joy when you spend it!   All my best,   -Zak from South Dakota|2020-09-09 12:58:04

4kdonv|ipd82q|ipd82q|0|Thot It can stand for 'That Hoe Over There'  A thot is usually active on social media especially instagram and Snapchat. On instagram she can be found in pictures of her in the dog filter and is usually half naked. On Snapchat she is most likely posting videos of her obnoxiously lip syncing to rap songs, while playing with her hair, thinking she looks like Kylie Jenner. Probably wears Calvin Klein, Adidas and Nike hats. She has perfect eyeliner and contour and she seems like she doesn't care what anyone think's about her. She may come across as a fake, conceited, shallow dumb bitch, but deep down she is insecure and unfortunately the only way she gets confidence is by getting validation from men on social media by posting pictures showing off her figure and plastic face. Next time you see a thot be nicer to them, they still haven't developed fully yet.  Hey but if you're a thot good on you, enjoy and embrace your thot life! 1. Jessica look at thot, breathing like she owns the place.  2. I hate thots so much! They're everywhere on instagram these days|2020-09-09 12:30:34
