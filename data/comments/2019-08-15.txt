wzfxmg|cqoc7q|cqoc7q|11|The word you were all looking for is *instability*.   Markets go up and they go down, that's normal. They don't go up and down and all around this fast so that bears in the morning turn to bulls at night and back again, especially for this long of a period, without a lot of uncertainty from investors. Uncertainty leads to fear, which leads to movement of money into safer harbors, which means it moves out of the economy over time, which means the economy starts to slow, which leads to more uncertainty and fear.   A recession might not happen today, or tomorrow, but this much instability all year long in the markets is a sure sign that one is coming. And considering the absolute shit down from DC and Beijing happening right now and the iffy low interest rates and lack of emerging industries and new markets to pull us out of a recession you better expect this to be a bad one.

wyxx7n|cqoc7q|cqoc7q|3|1 year of fucking around with this market  https://imgur.com/ykSTReC  Last friday I was about 3% away from finally breaking even. Lost all those gains on monday, then made all the losses back on tuesday, then lost all the gains I made back yesterday.  List of positions now  https://imgur.com/a/KHkT4A5  I bought puts to hedge my sold puts and then have long dated calls to Jan 2021 in case this rebounds to hedge the puts I bought. The shares are just all my underwater bagholders that I won't sell for a loss.  My strategy is to pretty much lock my account at $20,000 or so while I earn some money the lame way at my job during this fuckery. If stocks go up i'll make decent money, but if they continue to fall at least I will get some cash back from the puts and by selling puts I have already pre planned to by the dip.|2019-08-15 12:00:20

Instead of recognizing his mistake and switching back to Qualcomm for Modems, Tim decided he would rather continue his multi-billion dollar legal battle to destroy a smaller company and also - why not buy the failed modem business from the company that designed the same awful LTE modems from the iphone 7?

wzrnzm|cqoc7q|cqoc7q|2|I think that now that all the other cannabis earnings reports are out the way, ACB can distance themselves and focus on upward momentum over the next month into their own earnings report. Their updated guidance sent the stock soaring just a couple a days ago, but there's no way it couldn't get caught up in TLRY and CGC shitting the bed, and the overall stock market crashing in general.   There still is so much room on the table for growth if they announce any kind of major partnership, as they're still one of the few growers who hasn't announced that yet. I wouldn't be surprised if something is announced by year's end.  In the meantime there's probably still some selling to be had over the next week, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it pick up before earnings, then head back up towards 8 afterwards. They should be able to take the lead in market cap over CGC soon enough.|2019-08-15 15:09:05
