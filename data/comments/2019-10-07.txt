This post has been brought to you by magic crayons. Magic crayons, for all your losing needs.

Also, I'm open to any investment advice for my pathway forward. I just want to be smart with my money. Its going to take a long time to recover all of the money I have lost.

2wn8vh|dehwx4|dehwx4|2|Lol how can powell keep a straight face saying these words?   \---      Fed Chair Powell Underscores Importance of Independent Central BankBy Paul Kiernan  WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted the importance of an independent central bank on Monday, amid steady criticism of the Fed's monetary policy from President Trump in recent weeks.   Speaking at the premiere of a documentary about the late Marriner S. Eccles -- the Fed's chairman from 1934 to 1948 -- Mr. Powell focused on his predecessor's efforts to distance the central bank from political considerations.   "From my perspective as Fed chair, he is responsible more than any other person for the fact that the United States today has an independent central bank -- a central bank able to make decisions in the long-term best interest of the economy, without regard to the political pressures of the moment," Mr. Powell said of Mr. Eccles.   The remarks came at a time when the Fed is facing unprecedented public criticism from the president, who says it hasn't lowered interest rates enough. In his most recent attack on the central bank, Mr. Trump said via Twitter on Oct. 1 that rates are too high and that Fed officials "are their own worst enemies, they don't have a clue. Pathetic!"|2019-10-07 12:03:17

2vyq4x|dehwx4|dehwx4|2|Bulls are actually bears:  If markets were to crash, wealth vanishes quickly and the Fed must intervene to grease the wheels of economy to protect the systems of societal order. Such events are difficult to navigate and control, as the very act of pumping the economy with inordinate amounts of "free" money can cause difficult externalities like hyperinflation or stagflation.   On the other hand, indefinite economic growth is a mathematical fallacy in a world with finite resources capable of supporting a finite number of producers/consumers. Overvaluation of assets is a problem, when financed principally by central bank debt, because it also trends to "money not being real" and becoming increasingly worthless.   You can make money both ways.  Bulls understand that in both cases the entire order of society is at risk, but it's safer to march slowly upward, prolonging the inevitable, and continuing partying as long as there's any liquor still being served. **They're in on it**, *they know this is all shit*, but they're smarter to defend and protect our way of life instead of submitting to ruin.|2019-10-07 09:38:34

The state attorneys general probe into Facebook, announced in September, is being led by New York and also includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.  The meeting also included Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and antitrust assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim, the sources said.

I'm debating a 3-leg order to buy back my calls and sell 10/18 $31c and $26p.
