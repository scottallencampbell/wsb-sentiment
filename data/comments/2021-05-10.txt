S&P 500 futures are flat. that’s as of 0635.  This after the Dow closed at another record high on Friday, in spite of a non-farm payrolls number that fell dramatically short of forecasts.  Not all that much on the calendar today. No major data releases. Some earnings: Tyson Foods, Coty, Duke Energy, Marriott, Occidental, Simon Property.  This week will be all about the CPI report, out Wednesday. But a lot of this may not matter, and not just because the Fed has said they don’t care about inflation data right now.

Sometimes you wake up and the dream feels more real than reality. That's what Monday is like. The weekend felt way more real than this shit. Put on a costume.

Raw materials are hard to come by and soon they will be able to charge anything they want.   Entertainment is going to suffer IMO.  People will find their basic needs are going to go up in price before they can get an increase in pay.  Entertainment budgets are the first to get cut by the average American family.  Emerging markets are also likely to lose investments as people try to pour into something more stable.    Once the world gets back on track and we stop encouraging people to sit at home, we will go back to the way things were.  Do your own dd, find some good companies and do your own research.

xn6gf2|n90t4p|n90t4p|18|The year is 2030. Coca cola stock trades at 500 a share. McDonalds at 1,000. Citibank and Chase have grown so large that manhattan has been renamed "citibank city".   Warren buffet sits down, in his elbow padded blazer, sipping on another coke and big mac from McDonalds. he's got a lot of spunk for someone is his age still, as he slowly makes his way out of his old trusty gas powered Lincoln continental.   he says "those young whippernsappers, up in their clean energy and innovation stock shenanigans again, just like they did back in 2021/2020. but the boomers ALWAYS WIN. we ALWAYS win".   he goes back into his mansion, dropping McDonalds fries along the way on the ground, in a meeting with citadel CEO. "who lives in there?" asks ken griffen?   "oh, thats cathy wood, she rents out my boathouse now, got caught up in the ole disruptive innovation scam, ARKK holdings dropped 99.999% to 0.15 cents a share".   they look in the distance and snicker, slurping their cokes and slamming down more big macs. as the camera rises away you see a dense smog over the horizon, and new oil fields propping up. to right, you barely make out a giant landfill heap that says "EV vehicle recycling" - where you faintly make out the TESLA gigafactory sign on the top of the trash heap, and hundreds of coca cola trucks exiting the facility, recycling the defunct EV cars into the next coke cans.|2021-05-10 14:23:44

If you've invested in anything that you didn't do your own research on, dump it, look it up, revaluate your position and if you still think it's smart, then buy back in at the price you are willing to pay.

xloit2|n90t4p|n90t4p|2|So a few weeks after the colonial pipeline has the biggest oil spill in US history (which is only so big because they neglected their equipment and somehow didn't notice the leak until two random teenagers found it) they just happen to be hacked in a way that compromises the integrity of all the information stored on their servers?  As in all the evidence might just disappear because the ransomware guys either don't get paid or just delete everything anyway?  What is they play on this shitty company going bankrupt and possibly seeing prison times for leadership? Is there a company the builds pipeline equipment and sensors?  I would imagine with Biden shutting down pipeline projects it would be down big and there is a good chance we start seeing major refurb projects starting soon.|2021-05-10 07:47:24
