Which just doubled. So because of this massive psychological pressure i  sold them. Which means i am now freerolling the rest and feel so much  stress relief.

As a reminder, **this is the spread that Duke Professor Cam Harvey** **used** **in his seminal research on the yield curve as a recession signal in the 1980s.** It inverted from the middle of March until almost the end of October, then spent most of November in positive territory.There have been enough smart "this time is different" arguments made about yields this year to entertain the idea that maybe this time really is different.

The first cut at an analysis looks at household wealth from a generational perspective, picking up the baton from the "generational investment climate" columns over the summer. What I found is that the real shortfall in Millennial wealth, insofar as there is one, comes squarely via the paltry ownership of real-estate assets|2019-11-26 10:41:56
8sr0jc|e1who6|e1who6|3|Gentlemen, i think it's time to buy some STMP calls.  There are two incredibly large gaps to fill, they've turned things around in their last 2 earnings, and we're heading into the holiday season where there will be insane amounts of shipping.  They typically report earnings in late Febuary, and have an estimated earnings announcement date of 2/20/20.  The Feb 21 calls may capture this and are priced much better than the next expiration out in May.  We've just crested the 50 week average, are heading into a golden cross for the 20/50, and the 200 week is at around \~140 which looks fairly attainable.  By long dated calls in anticipation of good news, earnings run up, and big big gap fills.|2019-11-26 10:53:00
