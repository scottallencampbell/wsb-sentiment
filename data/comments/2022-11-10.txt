FOMC was meeting 6/14.  FOMC doesn't meet until 12/13 this time around so there will be a December CPI print as well.

Inflation expected to remain rapid through 2022, but could moderate in 2023. Rent inflation should slow next year. Used car prices decline.

vt2y0e|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|5|lmao we are never getting out of inflation...  ny times: If Federal Reserve officials are looking for signs of moderating inflation in corporate earnings reports, they might not like what they see.   A number of major companies have recently reported rising third-quarter sales and profits, thanks in large part to hefty price increases. Many executives said that they would continue raising prices, partly to cover rising costs and partly to expand their profit margins, noting that consumers appeared in many cases to be willing to pay more for the same goods and services.   PepsiCo, for example, reported that its profit in the three months through September grew by 20 percent from a year earlier. The company also increased prices of chips and drinks by 17 percent. “Our brands are being stretched to higher price points, and consumers are following us,” Ramon Laguarta, the company’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts.|2022-11-10 06:21:09

vtd5a1|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|5|For all those confused, 7.7% is not good but beats expectations. Simple. If trend continues fed will ease. It’s not enough consecutive months yet, but will start to get priced in as such. Bullish print|2022-11-10 07:51:49

vtd9p5|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|5|So just to recap only reason we went down yesterday is  1. Election results pending, people worried dems won 2. Crypto virgins  3. Cpi dread  That resulted in -2% so realistically we should be +5% today. Bears will call this Black Thursday 😎|2022-11-10 07:52:47

We still likely run today and tomorrow because people are going to think inflation will flip, but if I'm trying to maximize returns where do I go? Is retail mostly spent at this point between inflation, CC debt, and a cooling economy? Do high multiple tech stocks get the biggest ride up on lower interest rate expectations? What is too much risk in that space and are they exposed to the same risk as what I expect to be a delayed heavy crypto dump?|2022-11-10 08:17:27

vus52s|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|8|unemployed persons count rising helped cause rally because it means that the Fed Rate Hikes are "working as intended" and that since CPI is lower and unemployed rising then we can expect the Fed to slow down the rate hikes.  This is great news for investors because rate hikes are bad for markets because when borrowing rates go up, smart money moves out of the market and into bonds.  It's a double edged sword though, because rising unemployment is highly correlated with a recession and if it weren't for the bulls "hyper-focusing" on rate hikes, they would see that unemployment rising could be a bad sign for the economy.  Under normal circumstances unemployment numbers going up would not pump the market. If anything, we would see a pullback with such data. But these are not normal circumstances and bulls have tunnel vision on the Fed.|2022-11-10 13:32:49

vth7x0|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|3|The only possible fly in the ointment (now that it looks like CPI has peaked and turned a bit lower) is tight jobs markets.  I would not be bearish the next 6-8 weeks.  We're likely to see every dip get bought hard through end of year.  It's really in January/Feb as jobs markets likely remain too tight (around 3.5-3.7% unemployment with 200k jobs added each month) that the Fed will have to make tough decisions that the market may not like (i.e. adding some more 0.25% hikes to push up to near 5% on the Fed Funds rate).  But for the next 6-8 weeks, Tom Lee and the bulls will be running wild claiming a pivot and forcing financial conditions to ease (which of course is going to make the Fed unhappy).|2022-11-10 08:22:41

vtib2s|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|3|Imagine being JPow today.  You did all that work to keep financial conditions tight the past 3-4 months, and one report of 7.7% CPI inflation undoes most of it.  Can't imagine he's going to be happy to see 10 year already back under 4% when he put so much effort trying to stabilize it over 4.  I still think the big potential problem is that the Fed wants to loosen the tightness in jobs markets at any cost.  We can get down to 4-5% inflation pretty easily (most of the push above those levels was transitory due to Russia-Ukraine/China lockdowns/supply chain problems), getting down to 2% is going to require job losses.  Stocks can rally next 2 months but January-March is likely to be another rocky period.  (I'd buy puts in early January if SPY is back over 420).|2022-11-10 08:30:42

vtcnim|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|4|Take a look at inflation in 2008 before the tank. Inflation spike before a recession, then consumers hit their breaking point and stop spending, then inflation fall and becomes deflation.  Inflation peaked in July 2008 and began falling after that. The crash happened 2 months later in September 2008-jan2009. We're obviously on a slower time scale, but there is significant market fragility/risk. A single entity breaking could tumble the rest.  Personal debt and consumer spending will take a hit this winter and we are still entering a winter energy crisis after draining the SPR for midterms. Unemployment typically increases AFTER a crash. I can't help but still be bearish after a small rally this month.|2022-11-10 07:47:57

vue960|yrbkeg|yrbkeg|6|My prediction: algos will get adjusted once the rest of the deep data is accounted for. Too much bad news in that CPI report when you look past the top line number vs expectation. "Market Expectation" would have been a significant month over month rise.  Actuality is flat inflation, which means fed will stay the course.  We regress to a 2% up day by EOD. Tomorrow to midweek next week we regress to the mean of of 375ish on SPY. A month or so out we'll see a 10% drop over a couple weeks.  Take your profit, bulls.|2022-11-10 12:02:48

TSLA was capped over a trillion now they’re following below 500 Bn while BWM is at 50 billion and BMW, critically, actually makes fucking cars (I know, nuance, but they do way more volume and higher standard work)  Has Tesla gone up through pure Twitter memeholery because we were all in lockdown?

Base case is still that rates will remain higher for a longer period of time than most of you think.  Rally makes some sense because there is definitely some value out there, but once we get overbought and get any kind of negative news, market is going to come back down a bit again.|2022-11-10 13:12:04

Inflation will get out of control again next year, as lag effect takes place. Crude oil will surge putting pressure on Diesel shortages. Demand will rise and Supply will deplete again. FED will have to go back to 75 bps, and it won't work. They will go to 100 bps, and it won't work. They will have to send us into a recession, which already happened, just to kill demand. But the catch is that Demand will be obliterated in a recession with extremely high interest rates. The economy is toast.

Look at national rental prices and CPI OER, adjust for lag and it's coming down within the next report or two. This is extremely bullish (in terms of getting inflation down). What probably will fuck us eventually is oil/diesel but that's another story cause SPR releases were taming that part of the CPI.

Rode that shit down from $200+.  [The DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wyc3yk/i_am_once_again_reminding_you_there_is_money_in/)  I still think ~45$ is a fair value for COIN unless we see Bitcoin stick below 15k.   So why am I saying this? Your puts may have gotten fucked but COIN isn't more valuable. Let this epic incoming gamma squeeze run and then you can load back up, I will.
