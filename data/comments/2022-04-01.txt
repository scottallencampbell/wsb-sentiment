2zd8hq|ttn237|ttn237|10|I just hired a young female engineer to support automation and QC in our manufacturing operations.  Best choice ever.  The design engineers are usually very bad about following up or assisting with their projects once they get out to the manufacturing floor but she is a little flirty so they fall over themselves to support her and attend her meetings 😂.  Literally going to get all my bonusable goals this year because I have leached away 10% of the design departments resources.  She is better than the engineer she replaced too so it's really a super win for me.  Need to start planning how I'm going to lose $20k worth of bonus next Christmas on options.|2022-04-01 08:41:14

30fr80|ttn237|ttn237|6|Offered w/o comment, c/o Stanphyl Capital;  To illustrate how utterly absurd this is, going from 1.3 million cars a year today to 20 million in ten years means that in addition to one million cars a year of eventual production from the new German and Texas factories, Tesla would have to add 35 more brand new 500,000 car/year factories with sold out production; i.e., a new factory nearly every single quarter for ten years!   And what then? Well, then you’d have a car company approximately twice the size of Toyota (current market cap: $249 billion) or Volkswagen (current market cap: $110 billion). If that would make Tesla worth, say, $500 billion in 10 years, discounting that back at 15%/year and allowing for enough share dilution to pay for all those factories, Tesla—in that absurdly  optimistic scenario—would be worth just $100/share today, down almost 93% from its current price.|2022-04-01 12:59:45

30boxw|ttn237|ttn237|5|In the 1980s there was a movement of people buying silver bullion. They didn’t trust the fed. They didn’t like that the gold standard was gone.   The obvious question is “but Bruno, why didn’t they buy gold then?”. And the answer is simple. They were bamboozled.   Much like Apes, working class divorcees and college dropouts were easily swayed by slick talking swindlers. They bought Silver at 20 dollars per ounce. This shit was heavy too, literally the bags were heavy and the silver itself corroded. This corrosion of bag fulls of silver were called “tarnish” and the fools were again tricked into thinking this black silver was actually sought after.   So time passed. The price of silver dropped to 5 dollars an ounce for decades. In recent times it’s pushed up to about 24 dollars an ounce. Those old men still exist, with hundreds of ounces of black silver coins that can only be sold at melt value.   This situation is analogous to the apes today. The mentality of apes has existed as long as people have existed. Just like how young men of the 80s were bamboozled into buying and holding silver (and not gold), the young men of today are being told to buy and hold gme (and not spy).   Those who don’t study history are doomed to repeat it.   P.S. go to a coin store and try to buy gold. And watch as the salesman instead tries to sell you silver 😉|2022-04-01 12:32:54

Everyone bullish only because April has traditionally been good, but is that it? That's flimsy AF.  Last quarter's GDP numbers were entirely driven by a buildup of inventory - a one off pump not gonna repeat.  Consumer spending and sentiment were down.  This week's numbers also showed a smaller amount of consumer spending than expected.  The GDP numbers reported later this month are going to absolutely tank and show anemic economic growth, and support all of the fear of the inverted yield curve.  The giant increase in inflation is also going to crush companies' margins and earning season is gonna get ugly. This will be one of the worst Aprils on record.  The market has pumped for 2.5 weeks straight on almost zero positive news.  This is setting up for a nice fat deuce.|2022-04-01 06:44:36

When those 17 000 calls get hedged (they are not right now), watch out. It's game over and we run.  Been here since January and it's the most hyped I've been for an opening bell since June.

2zag1q|ttn237|ttn237|18|Not playing GME, but Cohen and GME board were genius to do a stock split. You have a rabid base of fucking  dipshits that will buy your stock no matter the price and actually believe that there are billions of synthetic shares created by shorts. Cohen buys a large stake, makes it public, HFs get the lowdown of a split, stock price runs up, retailers fomo in and push it further, then you make the split public? God damn, Cohen is a fucking genius.   Btw there is no gamma squeeze resulting in a $100k share price coming, but there is a legitimate case to go long in GME.|2022-04-01 08:19:54

30mu06|ttn237|ttn237|14|here’s a couple things to take away from the gme jan 2021 squeeze  1. robinhood did nothing wrong  2. ken griffin, citadel, wall street, and robinhood overall made billions from processing all of our trades during that period. mm’s make billions from our shenanigans and gambling every year, and more the more we trade.  3. because of the above fact, it is fucking ridiculous to suggest that robinhood halted trading to “help” hedge funds. they were hit with their own version of a margin call that would’ve bankrupted them. they literally had no choice.  4. tons of hedge funds made hundreds of millions of dollars by either exiting activist positions or playing the momentum. for every loser there is a winner.  5. this wasn’t “the people vs wall street”, wall street won and will always win  6. in a casino, if someone wins the jackpot, the casino doesn’t sigh out of sadness. No, there are bright lights and sounds and confetti, and many other gamblers trying to replicate what just happened.   so what gme really did was bring millions and millions of idiots to the market, and those same idiots lost money that invariably ends up in the pockets of wall street banks.  the uncomfortable truth is that this wasn’t a “revolution” and the dumb money just fulfilled its role on the food chain.|2022-04-01 13:48:00

GME will rally hard and drag other Meme-stocks with it, either from *"Memes Back on the Menu Boys"* or because Meme short sellers don't want to deal with this and covers their positions broadly, making other shit fly. 2. Every Meme-Buyer, their mother, momentum-traders and degenerate flocks to GME,  leaving other Meme or Meme-ish stocks with faltering buy pressure, or straight up selling of their other Meme-shit to go GME. 3. Everyone is getting fucked, because **why not**.    GME dumps, SPY dumps, VIX for some reason also dumps, Commodities strangely also dumps (esp. Gold)), Crypto tanks, and the only thing left standing is random China stocks because Xi tought it would be *funny.*|2022-04-01 09:12:07

2z03s6|ttn237|ttn237|4|Honest questions for the apes.   Per the SEC filling, shares outstanding are currently 300M and 700M will be issued, making shares outstanding now 1B. If GME isn't going to dilute, then the split would be fractional. Does that make sense ?   Also per the filing, they are reserving the right to use share sales for corporate purposes. Would this not also indicate a potential dilution?  Lastly, would a stock dilution not make perfect sense as mgmt? They raise a bunch of money at this valuation without incurring and debt.  Not fighting words! This is an honest discussion.|2022-04-01 06:51:32

The last time the yen got this weak (USD/JPY =125), China had to manipulate their currency down in 2015 in order to maintain a wide enough spread between the yuan and yen.
