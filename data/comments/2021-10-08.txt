Don’t smoke in your 20s because your coworkers or friends do. Don’t smoke while drinking. Don’t do it because you’re a hipster. Don’t do it.   If you currently smoke move to patches or nicotine gum.

fvpcwp|q3umur|q3umur|7|**Reason why $SPY will always go up**  Main requirement to join the S&P 500:  >last reported quarter must be profitable ✅  >aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅  Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.  Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!  Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!  SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.    #$SPY 600c DEC 15 2023  100 call leaps purchased on July 21 for $330 each are still up even after recent dips to $410 which is $8k profit https://i.imgur.com/bLZDjyy.png  ***Buy the dip.

Imagine thinking corporations will actually foot the bill for a tax and not just pass the costs onto consumers? The govt is stealing another 1/7th of what we own and saying it's a stunning achievement. What's stunning is that people voted for this. They were convinced higher taxes will help people. We've had revolutions over less. The Boston Tea Party was over 10% on just tea.        This will punish small business owners and destroy jobs.

There are these things you can do to get paid and people call them jobs because everyone's used to calling it that when you go somewhere to get paid for your time, but let's face it, the wording isn't accurate anymore.

Yes there’s an actual reason why it’s happening, and no it’s not just because of taxes. This is a much better business climate, a much better personal freedom climate. The same way people want to move to the United States versus other countries. The empirical data shows that, the same principle holds true “within” the United States. More people want to move to Texas. These people are dumb and can’t wrap their mind around it. They hate it 😄|2021-10-08 07:21:37

fuxei0|q3umur|q3umur|2|Warning this post IS financial advice:  Try to minimize the number of short term options you purchase and only put money in those options that you can afford to lose.  Options are an inherently high risk financial position and constantly applying high risk without any sort of hedge will eventually move your account to near zero values.  In gamer terms you are going to roll a natural 1 eventually.  Financial advice portion over.  Steel stocks are down bigly.  You are a huge idiot if you don't have big money on X and NUE.  They are 100% going up again the price of steel is insane right now.|2021-10-08 09:38:12

This is how the MM will layer it: Because they can't cause massive panic, in order to take it down 20% they will do the following. First, the MEME stocks take the biggest hit bc that fits their narrative and gives CNBC someone to blame. So meme stocks go down 25-50%. Energy and gold will go down 20% because they are always sucker bets. TSLA will take a massive dump of 25%. After that comes Tech goes down  10% bc they have to leave some hope for average investors who already made massive gains. The banks will go down the least because, well, they run the show and they will use the interest rate narrative to feather their nest. BaaS will be the biggest gainers and the new buzzword.|2021-10-08 09:58:35

What the fuck is the point of having the phrase "penny stock" available to use in the English lexicon? Like WHAT USE does it have? 2. What the fuck does a penny have to do with it in your eyes? Why the fuck is the word "penny" part of the phrase? 3. What makes your answer to questions 1 and 2 so fucking valuable to you that you need the phrase "penny stock" and you need to use the word "penny" in it and you're justified taking it away from people who want a phrase for stocks that are under a dollar so that they can specifically refer to stocks that are the absolute cheapest in the market, that can't move in increments less than 1% without trickery, that may be at risk of delisting - you know, stocks where the price per share being what it is actually matters and there's actually a fucking point to being able to communicate about it with a simple 2 word phrase?|2021-10-08 07:18:43

fuwpx0|q3umur|q3umur|1|So, RKLB had a prospectus become effective today but saw very low volume last night and in the morning, indicating that the newly released investors didn't sell off. Following that, it rallied.     Looking at the orders, I see lots and lots of little sell orders coming through every trade route, which suggests large block sales broken up. Unexpectedly (to me) though, large buy orders also came in, not broken up.     Gamma is harshly negative below 15 so that's a key level. I'm not sure what my thesis is here, but I'm holding puts I bought yesterday and the day before, now at a small loss. I might roll out to November because fundamentals on this company are not there, and the option chain is not really loaded up past October 15, plus large investors might just be waiting to sell into the strength generated by memey mania.|2021-10-08 09:33:15

Data from S&P Capital IQ show US-based Vanguard, Evergrande's third-largest shareholder, has seen the market value of its holding plummet by $156m since the beginning of January as the Chinese company teeters on the brink of collapse.  According to S&P Capital IQ estimates, which are based on the latest market close, Vanguard’s stake in the world’s most indebted company — the result of investments made via the US firm’s mutual funds and ETFs — is now worth around $33.3m, around 82% less than $189m value at the start of 2021.  The data also shows that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has suffered a $95.3m book loss on its Evergrande holding, which at the start of the year stood at just over $111m.  The collective unrealised loss for the two US fund management titans is around $251m.  "|2021-10-08 08:52:16
