tb337b|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|71|So I was just doing some looking around.  MSFT before ATVI acquisition had roughly $137B cash on hand.  That is more than the market cap of the 65th largest company in the SP500 CVS.    That is insane isn't it?  Only 64 domestic companies having a market cap larger than the cash balance of one company.  Google has \~170B cash on hand, only 54 companies have a larger market cap than 170B.   I dunno but I think this shit is unprecedented at least recently.  The sheer financial strength of the megacap tech companies compared to the rest of the market is like what you read about the early 1900 steel and railroad company monopolies innit?|2022-01-19 05:58:27

tb6yyf|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|8|At the height of Japan's massive asset bubble in the 1980s that was driven by low interest rates and very lax fiscal/monetary policy, the small area if land around the Tokyo Imperial Palace was worth more than the entire state of California. If you dropped a 10,000 yen note in Tokyo, the land beneath the note was worth more. This was also during a time when there was great fear that Japan would economically take over the world, and it's companies and stock market reached insane valuations.   That all came crashing down when the Bank of Japan had to start increasing interest rates and tightened monetary policy. 30+ years later the Nikkei still hasn't been able to surpass where it was in the 1980s. Japanese real estate has tanked and only recovered by a small amount. The economy has barely grown over the last 30 years.   The US has so many parallels with 80s Japan. Calls on a lost decade for the US now that the Fed is ready to prick the bubble. Diabetic sugar rushes always end in a crash.|2022-01-19 06:38:21

It's just a sad joke; I sort of feel bad that there are a ton of people that have put their lifesavings in these things and they're going to slowly watch the companies come down to more rational valuations (GME at $25-30 and AMC at $2-3).  That's another $15 billion in shareholder value that's likely to get wiped out between them and a lot of that is people that got into them on this sub.|2022-01-19 08:13:39

tbur7j|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|2|Free tip on how to make the best out of your balance:  If a stock is down. Buy 100 shares and sell CC on it to lower your average cost.  If it drops 5-10% more, sell 100 shares and buy 2x ITM leaps. This way your leverage is doubled and is fairly safe.  Only works on high quality companies during bear markets. Worked like 3-4 times for me.  If anyone thinks this is retarded lmk|2022-01-19 09:40:03

If you're trying to time dips though, you can just smash the fucking buy button whenever you're moderately comfortable and because everyone else is printing money out of the air, you're sure to hit a win somewhere?

tc415p|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|4|If you see a company with $6 in tangible cash and assets and the backing of a multi billion dollar marketing and distribution company, do you sell? No. But if you’re not already invested, wait. Because many in the market don’t accept the value of the companies they hold because bears are in the business of making you believe you will lose all your money if you hold.  But the truth is, you can be down 50% today and up 300% in six months.   Literally everything is at a discount relative to price targets for next year. Doesn’t it say something when FLNC gets a $35 price target and falls to $22? Or SOLO at $14 PT next year falls to $2? You have small caps across the board that are now trading lower than they were pre-revenue. and now that they’re generating cash, no one wants the stock?  Keeping buying.

tbu5qo|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|2|So I am a new ape investor, this is my first go at trading, and the free stock I got on the app was Nvidia. At $268, I was thinking of selling it and dumping all of that money into other stocks, selling it outright for the profit, or trading it for multiple stocks to make more money and go straight to the moon. Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated as I am new to this. I don’t have a lot of capital to invest right now.|2022-01-19 09:36:09

tbs4c6|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|2|For those new(ish) to puts, keep in mind that a put is like shorting the stock at the strike price and buying a call at the strike. The call component is what takes you off the hook for losses a true short would bear if the stock rose about the strike. While it is tempting to buy around the money, doing so means you are spending a lot on that implicit call option. Go deeper in the money with your put to drive down the amount you are spending on that call. Just a word of not-advice.|2022-01-19 09:22:29

td0atc|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|-6|PLTR  S&P reports that 102M shares of Palantir are sold short. This is almost 3x average daily volume on a stock that once rallied 176% in 3 weeks.   Palantir shorts are playing a dangerous game: Shorting a company that has $2.5B in cash, positive operational cash flow, minimal debt, and only 78% float. All amid impressive revenue growth.   A simple buyback announcement might be enough to trigger a short squeeze of epic proportions. The same is true for another "Reddit Rebellion" or "Stocktwits Spanking".   The "great rotation" from growth to value is a logical fallacy that ignores the basic fact that real rates are deeply negative. It's very profitable for financial advisors churning client portfolios though.   It's not exactly clear why raising nominal rates would effect a company that has mountains of cash, no long term debt, and generates positive operational cash flow. Nor is it clear why nominal rates reaching 2019 levels would make stagnant companies attractive.|2022-01-19 13:59:10

tbua0s|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|-2| Did some DD about $TCRI  Filings proof that Billionaire from Dubai Munaf Ali (Guy on the preview pic of the article posted) bought this clean shell.  At the world digital mining summit dec 2021  in Dubai he revealed that he bought a clean shell to list assets of his company phoenix tech consultants on the US stock market.  This is huge. News reports show that the company ordered the newest Bitmain mining rigs in an order valued 650M$!  They plan to order additional Asic rigs worth  2B in Q3 2022. This allows them to mine B T C worth 980M$ every year with an EH/s of 15!  This means that the company will surpass current players like $MARA $RIOT.  Valuation wise we are trading at a 100M marketcap. Previously named competitors trade well over 2B marketcap and had its peak at 5-7B$ MC!  Not to mention what happens once first official PR follows or the 8K drops.  According to Munaf Ali news are expected in Q1 2022.   This reminds me a lot of the $MARA IPO which also started on the OTC with a sp of 0.5$ and which peaked at 80$ after uplist to Nasdaq!  Exciting times ahead here.  https://www.unlock-bc.com/82100/mena-to-hold-10-percent-of-global-crypto-hash-power/?amp ,,|2022-01-19 09:36:57

Short interest of nearly 32%, or nearly 37% of the stock's present float of a little more than 56 million shares - both are unusually high levels. It's a conundrum simply because all of these short sellers are ultimately rejecting the company's, and an entire industry's likely growth.

tcrxar|s7nn8l|s7nn8l|-1|Why I’m Buying $RENT  By October 26, 2021, Rent the Runway Inc. expanded its ipo and raised $357 million. Stock price opened between $18 and $21.   Today, the company has a market cap of $337 million. That’s $20 million less than it raised in its IPO. Of course this doesn’t account for, you know, the entire rest of the fucking company that already existed before the IPO! Some estimates had it at $1.5B. They have a huge inventory, some subscribers, and a ticker that is awesome (it reflects their name, you guys).   Is it a good company? I have no idea. Am I going to make money by buying too much of its stock? Probably not. But the math doesn’t make sense. Why is it so low at $5.37? I mean how much lower could it go?
