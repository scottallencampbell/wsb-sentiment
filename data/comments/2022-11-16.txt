wkzgie|ywqgez|ywqgez|4|lol $TGT     Target has the absolute worst check out queue system imaginable. Lines of confused people because it is unclear which line is for self-checkout and which one is for the cashiers. It is unclear which cashiers are open or which one is next in line. Been that way for years at my local target.    It's not even like it's a space problem, I could easily redesign their checkout space to clearly differentiate between the two, move the lines to separate areas, and increase the visibility of the cashier area. Not to mention train the cashiers....some of those teens/grannies move slower than the speed of evolution.     This may be isolated to my local target, but I stopped going there because the checkout process is so utterly frustrating. Holiday shopping at Target?
