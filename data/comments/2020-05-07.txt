pradwo|gf3vim|gf3vim|15|If interest rates are nothing, values can be almost infinite.  - Warren Buffett    As an investor, you have two choices, put your money into bonds that yield no return, or put your money in overvalued stocks that will at least outperform inflation.  Everyone here keeps asking why stocks keep going up well here is your answer. However, Buffet is not buying stocks even if interest rates are at zero because he knows the fed will raise interest rates whenever inflation returns because the fed has targeted 2% inflation. So if you buy stocks when interest rates are 0% and rates return to 4% the value of your stocks will drop because people will exit from stocks and be more willing to go back into bonds.|2020-05-07 05:42:13

prschd|gf3vim|gf3vim|9|If you’re thinking of chasing NET into earnings be careful. You probably saw Akamai and Fastly blow out their Q1 earnings and you think Cloudflare is a sure thing but there is a big difference between Cloudflare and other CDNs: **they do not charge for bandwidth**. Their plans are all fixed cost and most of their customers pay little or nothing for their services.   Why does that matter? The reason other CDNs are killing it right now is because internet traffic is way up across the board. More internet traffic = their customers spending more money. Cloudflare, on the other hand, does not make more money when their customers push more traffic. If anything it will only increase their costs. *this is not financial advice, do whatever the fuck you want I don’t care*|2020-05-07 09:18:11

psaydz|gf3vim|gf3vim|9|Should I take out $500k loans for trading?   I just got accepted to medical school, so that I can become Dr. Retard. I’ve saved and yolo’d up to $200k, so I could technically pay for a bunch of my schooling. However, because I have future income potential, I can take out $80k in student loans each of the four years of medical school ($40k at 6.08% interest, $40k at 7.08% interest), and probably another $40k per year easily in private loans (~2-5% interest).   That being said, all student loans have the potential to be forgiven after working in a non-profit setting for 10 years. This would be 10 years after finishing medical school. That could be upwards of $350k forgiven, with the ability to yolo on it in the meantime.|2020-05-07 11:53:34

psakba|gf3vim|gf3vim|5|SQ lent $550M to small businesses in Q1 and only set aside $22M for bad loans.   They also lent $2.3B in 2019 that they normally sell to pension funds but there’s repurchase obligations clauses that would force them to buy it back under certain triggers.   So they might be looking at $1B+ in questionable loans on their books this year that they can’t sell cause no one wants them or that they have to buy back.   These loans are repaid with sales, which small business es have none of or very little, and reopening won’t mean anything close to projected sales they were expected to have when SQ issued the loan in the first place.

TSLA and SHOP are both so risky at this point I needed to change my game plan up. Get them longer expirations on the strongest companies.

pst6s3|gf3vim|gf3vim|4|Still time to get in on $BOX. Cheap premiums and basically enterprise-focused dropbox. Earnings on 5/27 which will capture through April 30th, so likely to see great gains. Look into the Enterprise License Agreement (3 year term) that they offer. Growth in that space, which is highly likely in this environment, will pay off huge for the forseeable future.   If DBX does well on earnings, BOX should run up big for the next month. Even if DBX tanks, I think there’s still great opportunity.  $BOX 6/19 17c $BOX 6/19 20c|2020-05-07 14:20:06

You’ve now created a spread that locks in any gains.  -  If it tanks, you’ve already taken the money from the calls (puts) you sold.  - If it continues climbing, you’ve got your bought calls (puts) that will remain at a higher price  than the one you sold, again, locking in profit.  Close the spread either together or one leg at a time the next day. If you’re feeling plucky, you can even buy to close those calls you sold when IV drops, and if the stock continues up, hang on to your original calls until you want to close them.  You’re welcome.

psy42l|gf3vim|gf3vim|3|I just wanted to state a revelation I had today, that may help some of you in your uncertainties with the market (mine is simply impatience). I’m not a technical analyzer, but I took a good look at prior crashes (.com crash and 08 crash, also market flux in 2016) in all of the crashes, there were fast recovery points that lasted for up to over a month. But eventually economic situations finally overcame the desire for bull profit and the market dropped, usually more than it did the first time. I think we are looking at that type of near future, but I’m going to switch my 1 month short positions for much longer durations. I feel a little more relaxed after looking at the graphs, I recommend you try it yourself.|2020-05-07 14:59:37

pry8jm|gf3vim|gf3vim|2|TLDR: bought 5 contracts and sold 4 for 30 percent pop in 5 minutes. Burned second day trade. Held one hoping to ride and sell higher strike call to avoid burning last day trade. Ended up selling last contract, did not count as 3rd day trade. Cost me about 50 percent of profit on final contract to learn this.   I learned something today. I bought 5 pton 42c when it dropped around 10:15 am. Sold 4 for a quick 5 minute 30 percent return. I rode the last one because I wanted to let it ride thinking I could sell a higher strike to lock in. Next higher strike wasn’t 43c like I thought, it was 45c. So I waited and waited hoping 45c would get close to my purchase price on 42c. It got close enough and I was greedy and didn’t sell the call. While the 45c was rising, In my 42c doubled. But I didn’t want to burn my last day trade. But it started dropping and said fuck it, profit is profit.   When I closed, I was expecting to burn my last day trade. But it didn’t! Is this normal? If so, I have cost myself a couple of other trades when I held one. Usually, I’d sell the next higher call.   Thanks. And hope this helps someone.|2020-05-07 10:11:20

prh50r|gf3vim|gf3vim|3|Tech, especially big/mega-cap, looks well positioned now, but I'm not sure this will continue to be the case.   Working in tech, there has been a clear picture developing where we see our clients looking to reduce their spend or delay payment for a few months, and more importantly our sales/revenue growth picture _for the next year at least_ has been drastically reduced. What are we doing because of that? Guess what, not cutting sales people but cutting R&D costs which is the first thing every other company is doing. Actively trying to reduce our AWS spend. Not taking on new contracts for tooling, etc.   Cloud and SaaS providers appear to be assisting in these efforts: AWS for instance won't let you not pay your bill but they're willing to help reduce it. I've recently had an offer from a SaaS company for an N month period of "unlimited use" if we sign a contract today - desperation.   Sales/Revenues are going to shrink as all of the mid/small tier tech attempts to shrink R&D spend to stay alive when their clients can't afford to pay or they can't attract new client spending, and I'd expect this to be much clearer come Q2 unless we actually "bounce back" which is way too optimistic IMO|2020-05-07 07:20:00

psezje|gf3vim|gf3vim|6|>**Powell**: “In certain circumstances like the present, we do have the ability to essentially use our emergency lending authorities and the only limit on that will be how much backstop we get from the Treasury Department. We’re required to get full security for our loans so that we don’t lose money. So the Treasury puts up money as we estimate what the losses might be…Effectively $1 of loss absorption of backstop from Treasury is enough to support $10 of loans.”  The Fed was created in 1913 under the Federal Reserve Act. There is nothing, whatsoever, in the 107-year history of the Fed that states or even suggests that it can lever up taxpayer money by 10 to 1 to bail out Wall Street and stick the taxpayer with the losses. This was an outrageous plan hatched out of thin air by Kudlow, Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin with zero regard for the legality of the plan.   Corrupt Fed, corrupt Treasury!

prlhm0|gf3vim|gf3vim|2|It occurs to me that there are 33 million unemployed in the US who are receiving their usual unemployment+$600/month.  &#x200B;  And it is unlikely we will see unemployment payouts cut before September.  &#x200B;  And these 33 million have literally nothing to spend money on. They already bought videogames. They aren't commuting anymore. They cant go to bars or movies. They haven't changed out of sweatpants in weeks so they don't need more clothes. They already bought or sold their home gym equipment. They can't gamble on sports. A lot of these people even had their rent payments suspended.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Literally the only thing left to spend money on is Robinhood. Maybe the rug pull wont come until rent comes due and all these people suddenly need to sell their stocks to start paying for their gas and rent and bills? But maybe that will never happen because the US government will just keep extending unemployment benefits until employment numbers come back?|2020-05-07 08:10:02

prkoob|gf3vim|gf3vim|2|This is a quote from Baillie Gifford, one of the main tech meme stock investment management firms. Think of literally any meme stock that's pumped non-stop; they are one of if not the main guilty party.   Here's a quote of their "great depression investment strategy.  We try to take a long-term view” Nisbet says. As he explains it, the absence of pressure to deliver quarter-to-quarter results allows Baillie Gifford’s investment teams to focus on identifying winners that will succeed over extended periods, including bouts of market weakness.   But when markets are troubled, priorities must change: “Usually, we’re spending a lot of time saying, ‘Look how much this company could grow over the next 10 years, it’s going to be worth five or 10 times the amount it is today,’ which is great. But it has to be around in the first place in order to grow. And therefore, right now, our analysts are looking at the balance sheets of the companies, to say, ‘right, let’s just check that this is going to survive’”.   That said, longer-term growth prospects remain the key to investment decision making, as Nisbet points out. “In our stock discussions, I think one thing that separates us from many managers is that we spend most of the time looking at the upside. How well could this company do? We do need to check it’s going to survive first, but, then, how well could it do and how undervalued is it? Most people’s tendency is to spend most of the time knocking the case down, saying ‘what about this or what about that?’   “We have a rule in the team I work in that, for the first 20 minutes we discuss a stock, if you’re going to speak, you have to say something that contributes to the bull case. If you say, ‘but what about?’ you get kicked out of the room."|2020-05-07 08:01:17

Media wants you to think 150k red blooded 20-40 year old people have died in the streets with blood pouring out of their eye sockets and ears  Covid gets into a nursing home and kills basically 80% of the people it it and that is what accounts for 90% of deaths.

Love the vertical spread! So many more ways to recover a shit position!|2020-05-07 11:44:15

[**DBX,          +7.59%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/DBX?mod=MW_story_quote)shares initially climbed nearly 5% in after-hours trading Thursday after the enterprise-software company reported fiscal first-quarter revenue and net income that topped Wall Street estimates.

The S and P 500 is composed of the companies that are best positioned to handle any environment, and thrive in any economy.  The FED is spending trillions to support the market. Betting against it seems retarded.   Is unemployment outrageously high? Yes... But the US economy as a whole is comprised of many private small companies; companies that don't have access to loans and are living on a month to month basis.   Is Coronavirus going to change consumer spending? Yes... but companies with billions of dollars of credit lines and cash stockpiles are going to be able to take all of the business associated with the small companies that are going under...   Big companies are going to get bigger.|2020-05-07 12:46:00

The stocks crashed and people all over the country lost all of their money. The whole country suffered a catastrophic loss of money and property.|2020-05-07 07:26:35
