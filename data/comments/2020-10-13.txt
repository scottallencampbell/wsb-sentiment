8owxoe|jaaj59|jaaj59|45|Quick story time: I’m missing my right arm due to a car crash when I was young. When I was in high school, I had the opportunity to be a Senate Page, which meant that I got to work on the floor of the Senate.   The best thing that ever happened there was an interaction I had with Senator Inouye of Hawaii. Now, you need to know that we were under strict orders never to bother Senators unless they spoke to us first. So we were all meek and sheepish around them.   Anyway, my best memory was sitting at the rostrum on the Senate floor, and Senator Inouye flagged me over.  I rushed up to him, thinking he needed something, and he says, “you know how your arm still feels like it’s there?”  “Yes senator”  “That feeling never goes away, your arm just feels shorter as you get older. I’m old now and it feels like my hand is right here.” He motioned to the end of his stump.   Before I could respond, Senator Dorgan from my state walks up and says, “what are you boys talking about?” And Dan Inouye looks at him as serious as can be and says,  “It’s a one arm thing, you wouldn’t understand.”   Dorgan was speechless and just sort of wandered away. Inouye is still my hero for that. Just remember, if you ever do become rich and powerful, treating those around you with humanity can be life changing to them.  I didn’t ever want to be an amputee, but with just a few words, Senator Daniel Inouye initiated me into an exclusive club and I’ll never be able to thank him for that small act of kindness.|2020-10-13 08:47:21

I've changed my strategy to only buy 3-6 month calls on big red days for the market or a good company and have been on quite the streak. My last call was AMD after they dropped 4% on Friday. It's printing big. Also stopped trying to make plays every day. My next play will probably be after earnings later this month. MSFT usually makes a big drop after earnings and I'll make a big call purchase if it happens. Or any other good company that has a profit taking session after earnings. I have a long way to go to get profitable, but sticking to a strategy and making fewer plays with longer term calls have done wonders for my bankroll.|2020-10-13 10:00:17

8p10d1|jaaj59|jaaj59|7|Covid mortality is lower because they've gotten more skilled at treating you *once you're in hospital*.

8pnu4s|jaaj59|jaaj59|6|Introducing new Apple iPhone 12  Gone are the days of laborious voice communication. The new iPhone doesn't make voice calls like any other phone. It records your voice, and sends the secure iVoice file to your local iMail center. Your iVoice gets printed on iPaper using an iPrinter with secure iInk and gets iMailed to the recipient. Who can then decide using an iGotMail device to recreate an iVoice file which can be loaded onto their iPhones.   IMail provides expedited 2 week delivery for $29.99 and super expedited 13 day service for $39.99 (fulfilled by USPS).  Tomorrow will never be the same again!|2020-10-13 12:42:55

8pzehn|jaaj59|jaaj59|4|>	Kinda feeling sorry for you if you’re still buying puts ngl. Not for how much money you will lose next week. But for how when you finally realize that shorting the bottom was a shitty idea (this will likely be done after our second or third week of rallying), stocks would have returned to their highs and now you have absolutely 0 viable plays.

8ow9r7|jaaj59|jaaj59|7|LMAO so get this... I held off buying any calls in August because i thought there was no way the market could keep going up. I finally decided to buy calls on RKT, TSLA, and AAPL all at near ATH on September 1. I then experienced the giant crashed 1 day later. I held until all of my positions turned worthless because "there's no way the market can keep going down". Now with what little i have left, i was planning to buy the dip and i did, held it for around a few weeks but i sold all of my calls last Friday because "we could probably go a little lower"... just checked the prices of the options i sold last friday and i could have made back everything i lost and more if i held. I feel like i am literally making the worst possible plays here. like it must take skill to time the market this horribly|2020-10-13 08:40:30

I’m from the Netherlands and we’ll probably be getting a full-blown lockdown again, so will most of Europe. Not saying it’ll be a big “crash”, like in March, but I’m expecting easy mode to be turned off for a while.

8oiqia|jaaj59|jaaj59|17|It's insane that the market is so unregulated that you can force a gamma squeeze that launches entire indexes into the stratosphere if you have a billion dollars or so. If you think Apple is up 8.5% in 1 day + PM because they didn't decide to suddenly stop making new iPhones, you buying right into the gamma squeeze. Which, to be clear, will likely work. Going along with big money is smart.   But, this is just the beginning. We're about to create the biggest bubble the world has ever seen with this gamma manipulation, because every firm with money is gonna start trying the softbank move. Because we've now seen that it works, twice.   And the SEC is gonna just stand and watch, because they're under-funded and honestly sorta dumb af.  Looking at all 3 indexes right now is just nutty. Nasdaq is going to the moon while the other indexes can't even manage to go green.  I'd do anything to time this bubble right. Gonna be a true millionaire-maker. You'll end up losing everything trying to time it, though.|2020-10-13 05:40:20

8pzlxb|jaaj59|jaaj59|2|Ah yes the dip always gets bought for some reason. Retail investors buying in droves on reopening optimism as shit gets ready to lock down again for the winter; on vaccine optimism as trials are paused and vaccines *might* be available by spring 2021; on election optimism as the President threatens not to step down if defeated; on economic recovery hopes as we see 840k new unemployment claims per week, not counting the state of California; on stimulus hopes as stimulus is almost certainly dead until February. They just installed Robinhood and bought whatever was trending. They're seeing great bargains in companies with multiples of 1,100+...

ABT is a manufacturer of COVID tests. I imagine test demand will only steadily decline once we get a vaccine (maybe a short term dip to ABT as a market reaction). Also there is an immediate need for more tests in EU and China which will cause demand to go up in the short term.   Additionally, ABT owns Enfamil and Similac baby formulas. It’s feasible we will see an increase in babies born between March and May 2021  (quarantine baby making) which may result in increased sale of formula. We won’t see that reflected until April 2021 or July 2021 when ABT reports quarterly earnings.|2020-10-13 07:33:16

8q56a8|jaaj59|jaaj59|0|I was with my finger on the BUY button on TSLA back on March 23rd when it dropped down to 70 (old 350 price) and was about to put about 1.5 million in it (shares, not options). I didn't do it cause I thought a worldwide pandemic would cause people to stop buy expensive luxury cars. Turns out I have zero understanding of how this world works and the relationship of global events to stonks.  I could have made 10 million dollars if buying at 70 and selling at 500.  I guess the only want to deal with stonks is based on faith. I should have BELIEVED in that Elon Musk meme master.|2020-10-13 15:06:40
