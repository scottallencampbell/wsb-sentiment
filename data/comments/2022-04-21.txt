Industry average of 4.5 times revenue meaning a base valuation of $14,4bil and a price/stock of $23.  WISH stock is traded at $10 valuation at $23.  All in all...

Overall Market - the market is forward looking - Fed announces inflation effects may be present as early as 2022. Market is suddenly blinded about the future and just wants to look at all the stimmy money that got pumped into its bloated corpse  Oh by the way we are beating our projected GDP by 2% for 2021- Market is suddenly forward looking again - but not too forward it‚Äôs just looking at the end of 2021 because it likes it.

2jqmn0|o4rqmn|o4rqmn|2|I know you all hate precious metals here, but Basel III implementation goes into effect in one week which requires EU to actually hold 85% of their gold holdings in physical form not paper, US follows July 1 , UK Jan 1.  Its estimated that 200-250x leverage in "paper" gold exists, on top of china, russia and just about everyone else dumping the dollar for gold right now. This basically means banks who want to trade gold are going to have to actually go out and purchase large quantities - hence why the price got hammered down last week - banks dumping "paper" gold. Might not be a bad play to load up some calls a few months out, they're pretty cheap rn as metals got beat down hard last week but gold is already recovering.

2kny8h|o4rqmn|o4rqmn|-1|B. Riley (NASDAQ:RILY) initiated coverage of Globalstar with a buy rating and a target price of $3.25 on the stock, currently at $1.52.  According to Riley, "Globalstar and its sponsors, after years of development, support, and patience, are at long last starting to realize a return on satellite system and spectrum assets, making 2021 an excellent time, in our opinion, to buy GSAT."  Riley argues that "at the high end," Globalstar's C-Band spectrum alone could be worth some $15 billion. But Riley doesn't think you even need to stretch that far to find value in the stock.  Short interest is approx. 50 million shares.  ü¶ç‚ù§Ô∏è **GSAT**|2021-06-21 14:58:27
