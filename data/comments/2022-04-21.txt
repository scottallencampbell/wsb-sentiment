5m04pa|u8k0ou|u8k0ou|8|Equine-assisted therapy is the most effective mental health treatment I’ve ever had. It’s essentially talk therapy while performing tasks with a horse. It works because they’re prey+ herd animals and value safety+ community over everything else. They want companionship, but that’s less important to them than safety. If they sense you aren’t expressing your genuine emotions or holding something back, that isn’t safe, so they won’t work with you. It sounds silly, but trying to entice a pony to walk around a ring with me without a lead taught me how to cry. If I ever started to suppress my feelings she would immediately move away from me. They’re incredibly intuitive animals. I only wish this type of therapy was more accessible.|2022-04-21 07:55:46

It's usually comfortably in the Top 10 or Top 20 in most countries. Currently ranked 36 in the USA. The worst fall is in the Scandinavian countries, where it's out of the Top 100 everywhere. It hasn't been that low ever since 2014.

It is and was always going to be about preserving the asset bubble.  Any Fed chair remotely concerned about inflation would be out here, brow furrowed, warning about a 75 basis point or even 100 bp hike. But, nah, it’ll be 50 if I wake up on the wrong side of the bed but otherwise, expect 25bp if anything.  ![img](emotet5_2th524641)|2022-04-21 13:01:39

Yeah, my TSLA 1250 call got IV crushed, and I was wrong to be so optimistic about its prospects post-earnings, but this more than makes up for it. If the motel owner decides to kick me out because I didn't take his ridiculously exploitative offer for the night security watchman job, I've got enough cushion that I can go somewhere else and not be homeless. I can even afford a cab to the station and a bus-or-train ticket to the next town with all my belongings and not have to leave anything behind, as I have many times before. Thank you Lord Jesus Christ, who is my Lord and Savior, who owns the cattle on a thousand hills, who is sovereign over all markets and nations and mortals. All glory to you, O God.

It goes -   'Learn to sell early, live with regret and become rich because of it'  Basically, take small gains and cut your losses, and compound over time. Today I sold near open for a 300$ profit, if I wouldve held til now it couldve been an 800$ profit. But every time that happens there will be a time where you hold too long and then lose all your gains and sell for a loss.|2022-04-21 11:51:57

We've already seen [grain prices reach all-time highs](https://www.agweb.com/markets/futures) and if the U.S. has a bad crop this year, shit could go much higher.

Edit: This day has nothing to do with Jay Powell speech. That is an illusion. They forced the market up this morning to test the 347 level. The rejection of that level is why this is happening.

5n91d7|u8k0ou|u8k0ou|2|Most of the growth/tech stocks crashed into oblivion. This type of environment is where value shine. It’s even more apparent now. Unlike speculative growth, you can’t sell down apparent value.   On the other hand, you’ve got the culty overvalued stocks like tesla and GameStop still holding their price tag but you’ve gotta question for how much longer. It seems like if you can still perform in this market and not give a reason for the market to beat you down, you can still survive and maybe even thrive.   Energy gang and bears are the biggest winner after all in this chapter.|2022-04-21 12:59:02

5mfkmo|u8k0ou|u8k0ou|1|the brilliant guys at the fed are raising rates because food/energy/housing costs are exploding. Somehow higher rates are suppose to get more oil out of the ground, more farmers to plant corn/wheat and builders to build more homes  If anything higher rates will make it harder for producers to access capital. If anything, there will be less investments into oil wells, farmland and houses. This will create a doom loop where higher rates actually create higher prices, sending inflation even higher, forcing the fed to raise rates even more due to their stupid fallacies, making suppliers produce even less, sending prices even higher.  expect oil to be 300, wheat to be 4000 and average home prices to be 1 million by year end.|2022-04-21 09:47:44

If SPX breaks 4380, it will cause waterfall algo blackbox selling. Massive relentless $TICK selling prints. The way the market dies is high growth -> semiconductors -> big tech names. We're on stage 2 at the moment, when MSFT, AAPL, and TSLA finally give in, the real selling will begin. Market structure is confirmed bearish regardless if you're a fundamental or technical trader. Being a bull at the moment is like fighting gravity, being long is like flying a kite in a hurricane. Imagine if you're swimming in the ocean, you are swimming against the current. With rising interest rates, institutional funds are risk-off especially in tech, path of least resistance is lower! Targeting -3.5+ ATR. The real fireworks are just beginning|2022-04-21 13:54:29

Now I noticed that a few other ad/tracking apps are going through the same thing. Facebook, Youtube and (to a smaller extent) Pinterest and Instagram are all dropping like crazy.  They are all lower than they have been at any point since 2014. Twitter doesn't seem affected. This is happening globally in all countries. The same is not happening on the Android charts. Was there some stealth update/change that went into effect that is interrupting their ability to monetize? I'm playing Snap puts and a bear spread tonight.

I ran out of money to cover more puts and the stocks keep going down. What do I do now?      My portfolio is like -40% ytd|2022-04-21 14:35:48
