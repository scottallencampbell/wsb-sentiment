Yet it has led to exponentially more of an increase than that. So it's not literally the QE that's boosting the market but rather the sentiment it encourages. Same with tradetalksgoingwell.exe.

7ybbm8|dy1s47|dy1s47|1|We can't trust anonymous sources in Chinese government... but if true it sounds like China might decide to take a "wait and see what happens" approach to the trade war and to Trump's presidency in general rather than go through with any sort of phase 1 deal.   The question then becomes is Trump bluffing about the December tariffs or will he pull the trigger? Does his current political situation even allow for him to take such an unpopular action? Remember this set of tariffs would be the first to really hit electronics such as iPhones and other consumer goods. With such negative consequences for the economy that his own advisors urged him to choose mid December rather than October for this set because otherwise it would "ruin Christmas"|2019-11-18 09:34:12
