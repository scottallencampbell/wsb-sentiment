Yet it has led to exponentially more of an increase than that. So it's not literally the QE that's boosting the market but rather the sentiment it encourages. Same with tradetalksgoingwell.exe.

Also heard they have a really low performance target that's benchmarked a little above inflation or something so they're generally pretty conservative and do well.

Their CEO and COO had an interview: “There’s no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be obtuse ~~clear~~ about who we really are. We can't be spoutin' that same anti-gay shit people in the US think is funny still,” Chick-fil-A President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Tassopoulos said in an interview with Bisnow. “There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, all of them entirely true about how we hate the gays and funded organizations to prevent their civil liberties, and we thought we needed to be ~~clear~~ obtuse about our message if we wanted any chance at successful expansion into places that aren't the US.

The question then becomes is Trump bluffing about the December tariffs or will he pull the trigger? Does his current political situation even allow for him to take such an unpopular action? Remember this set of tariffs would be the first to really hit electronics such as iPhones and other consumer goods. With such negative consequences for the economy that his own advisors urged him to choose mid December rather than October for this set because otherwise it would "ruin Christmas"|2019-11-18 09:34:12

7xxv31|dy1s47|dy1s47|0|Hey guys so in 2015 I bought $225k of UPRO (S&P leveraged 3x), basically my whole portfolio at the time, and held onto it until 2018. Made really good profit. Don’t have it anymore since I have $890k in stocks now and my risk appetite is lower. Has anyone else invested like this?|2019-11-18 06:27:51

7yezjm|dy1s47|dy1s47|0|It’s funny that these bears think negative trade news is not priced in. Reality is that markets likely priced in unlikelihood of trade resolution. If there is no trade deal soon or more tariffs then market pricing in lower interest rates will begin to drive the market up even further. Why do you think Trump just had a meeting with Powell?|2019-11-18 10:15:09
