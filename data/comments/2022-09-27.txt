So these high yields means bonds are being sold off, and rapidly at that.  Currently yield curve is inverse, which means the yield is higher for shorter term than longer term bonds. This signals more selling of short term bonds and overall less market confidence in the short term.     You need to pay attention to BOTH the 10 yr, 5yr, and 2 yr treasury yields and see how that inversion gap grows or closes. Take today for example, the 10 year yield rose while 2 year is flat, which closes that inversion gap, normally a bullish development, but in this case still bearish as the yield curve is still wildly inverted.|2022-09-27 09:49:32q40b9i|xpce3p|xpce3p|9|There will be a huge drop this week|2022-09-27 09:58:33q430ky|xpce3p|xpce3p|9|VIX waking up ![img](emotet5_2th5218632)![img](emotet5_2th5218632)|2022-09-27 10:17:01q45by8|xpce3p|xpce3p|10|Why am I such a pussy.

I’d say a descent to at least 363 is sure by this point but be careful around that level and watch for the reaction and keep an eye on the volume. A very high volume rejection off the LOY could mean a bounce is imminent(bounce, not recovery) and if it breaks through that level then we’re looking at some major downside. Third option is it settles around that level and chops, which seems fairly likely  Good shorts include MCD (currently plummeting and little support to be found on the d1); CHTR continues to be weak and also has a good D1 for a short;  On the long side I’ll be keeping an eye on basically the entire semiconductor market, energy(OXY), and LLY because it has continued to be strong through the drop although it is fairly volatile at times  Good luck|2022-09-27 11:04:27q4a96k|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|$362.17 is the lowest point for spy this year, no?|2022-09-27 11:04:34q4abpq|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Not worried until we break Junes low of 360|2022-09-27 11:05:01q4ad1u|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Not looking gud guys|2022-09-27 11:05:16q4adep|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Bro, people are sabotaging Russia now lol  We are going to see desperation soon.|2022-09-27 11:05:19q4aeoo|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Fucking MM fill my UBER trade pls|2022-09-27 11:05:34q4aero|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Is this capitulation??   😲🤲🦋|2022-09-27 11:05:35q4aq6b|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|362.17 and it’s game|2022-09-27 11:07:40q4aqff|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|🔪🐂🥩🥩🩸🩸|2022-09-27 11:07:43q4aqlf|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|BOOLS GOT FUCKIN RUGGED LMAO|2022-09-27 11:07:44q4aqze|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|BULS LMAO|2022-09-27 11:07:49q4arbk|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Sqqq actually green and at 57 this is kinda insane|2022-09-27 11:07:53q4aruc|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Short everything in this market lmao|2022-09-27 11:07:58q4arwk|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Bears beat bulls anytime in a real fight|2022-09-27 11:07:59q4at0i|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|This is the beginning of capitulation|2022-09-27 11:08:11q4atuv|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Ooops|2022-09-27 11:08:20q4av3k|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|This 363 level is crucial|2022-09-27 11:08:34q4avyj|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Paging u/spiritual_extreme_81 for a wellness check|2022-09-27 11:08:43q4aw0v|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Bone zone|2022-09-27 11:08:44q4awh1|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|10 year gonna be 4% by close.|2022-09-27 11:08:49q4awij|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Oooo bulls bamboozled twice in less than 24h|2022-09-27 11:08:49q4aws4|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Gonna get me a bull's wife as a gf tonight ![img](emotet5_2th528882)|2022-09-27 11:08:52q4ay87|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|We want 350|2022-09-27 11:09:08q4aynj|xpce3p|xpce3p|3|Will we pass the June low today?
