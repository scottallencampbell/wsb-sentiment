WTF  AbCellera is the latest IPO backed by Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR), the big-data analytics company that went public in September via a direct listing. Shares of Palantir have nearly tripled from their $10 IPO price and are trading at $28.42.  The Vancouver, British Columbia–based AbCellera reported $1.9 million in income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, compared with $570,000 in losses for the same period in 2019. Revenue tripled to $25.2 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30 from $8.4 million in 2019.   AbCellera is expected to price its IPO on Thursday, Dec. 10, and trade the following day. The company is offering 23 million shares at $14 to $17 each and could raise $391 million at the top of its expected range. It is slated to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker ABCL. Underwriters include Credit Suisse, Stifel, Berenberg, SVB Leerink, and BMO Capital Markets.|2020-12-09 06:55:48

f5v9xi|k9pwht|k9pwht|14|DASH is a pure money grab and a terrible deal for retail.  During the lock downs, which is supposed to be a period of the absolute best case scenario possible for stay at home companies like DASH, DASH still can't make a profit.  DASH has no moat, and its profit margins are terrible to the point of being negative.  The only thing suckers buying DASH will get are losses unless they're able to unload the bag to a bigger sucker before the stock tanks.  DASH will open at $100, but in reality it is a $20 stock at most.  An IPO with dismal financials will attract flies and fly for brains. It's only going to get worse as the globe opens back up in '21.|2020-12-09 06:52:12

f7bf62|k9pwht|k9pwht|9|Fellow retards, today might just be the most YOLO I've ever acted and I've never been more proud.  Sold my PLTR stock at 27.37$ for a 14% profit so I could buy C3 out of sheer FOMO.  Then, having realized the stock is fucked and way overpriced I sold it for a 9.3% loss.  Feeling dejected and a bit out of it I look in awe at the Green Witch stock that was over 1000% up and told myself, fuck it.  Put the whole value into the transaction, bought it at 67.45$ and set a price target of 100$.  When the transaction executed my jaw just about hit the fucking floor.  Picking myself up, I put the new gains back into PLTR for 26.29$ because stonks only go up.  My god that was fucking retarded but I'd do it all over again.|2020-12-09 14:09:32

f78kqx|k9pwht|k9pwht|9|Visa is the easier stock to trade: it's been stuck between $205 and $220 for the past few months. So I buy $210 puts expiring in 2 weeks when the share price is above $215, sell for profit when it inevitably dives below $210 for profit. Wait for it to go below $205, then buy $210 calls expiring in 2 weeks.   It's literally fool proof and I'm up 10x. I started with $350 only as a joke and I've been following it for 2 weeks now. Can I hit $30k by end of Jan? Stay tuned.|2020-12-09 13:47:30

During the [War of the Ring](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ring), the palantíri were used by many individuals.

Make your own decisions and do the research!  -	Their 2 largest customers each account for 10% of their revenue -	Baker Hughes has the exclusive right to offer the software in the oil and gas industry and have made total revenue commitments of $53.3, $75 and $125m, and $150m for FY21, FY22, FY23 and FY24 -	they are allied with AWS, IBM, INTC and MAFT to jointly sell, market and service their offerings across industry verticles -	partnership with Fidelity National Information System, which processes 75 billion transactions per year -	As of the end of October 2020, they only have 30 Entities/64 customers, but their top 15 customers have doubled their requirements over the past year -	87% of revenue is derived from subscription fees, while the remaining comes from professional services and usage-based runtime fees. Subscription terms are generally 3 years.  -	payment by customers is usually required to be paid annually on an up front basis (which may be a barrier to entry for smaller organizations) -	there are several private placements occurring concurrently with the IPO - MSFT and Spring Street Capital are expected to purchase 1.35M and 2.7M shares respectively -	Condoleeza Rice is a board member|2020-12-09 08:14:47

And we still haven't gotten through the lock downs that are coming in jan/feb/mar.  How screwed is commercial real estate and banks with large exposure to commercial real estate loans?  Will it spread over to residential real estate?  Banks with huge losses on commercial won't want to take on more risk handing out residential RE loans I'd hazard to guess.|2020-12-09 06:43:37

f61a9o|k9pwht|k9pwht|6| T Calls dated out to January, see DD below. T is trying to get HBO Max on Roku and vice versa, just hashing out their differences. T is going to moon into January after Wonder Woman 1984 is breaking records on their streaming service...  In the end, it’s all about the money and who it goes to. If Roku is  able to sell HBO and HBO Max subscriptions as a channel, it can tap into  the ad revenue, but if WarnerMedia gets its way and HBO Max is launched  as a standalone app, all the money goes straight to Warner. This issue  was the same reason for the hold-up on Amazon Fire devices, but  WarnerMedia ended up winning in that standoff.  So, it becomes a countdown to Christmas, with *Wonder Woman 1984*  set to become the hottest title debut on HBO Max on Christmas Day.  Warner also sees the holiday season as a boon to its case against Roku  too, with people more apt to buy new streaming devices, and not  subscriptions, as gifts.|2020-12-09 08:00:31

f6xqe4|k9pwht|k9pwht|4|JP Morgan bullish into H1 2021. Just got their 2021 market outlook..       Equities are facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains next year. After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, US election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. We expect a “market nirvana” scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1H21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. We expect next year to be front-loaded with most of the market upside realized in the first six months of the year, driven by:      Given the above (and as detailed in our November Strategy report), we see the S&P 500 reaching 4,000 by early next year. Our base case S&P 500 price target for 2021 is 4,400 with a range of 4,200 to 4,600. Our 2021 EPS estimate is $178 (consensus $168.85) and 2022 EPS is $200      SPY $460 next year.|2020-12-09 12:24:28

f66v0r|k9pwht|k9pwht|3|In some sense, the GME hate is deserved because a lot of retards piled on to it without doing any of their own DD. The amount of distress at the (so far) less than 20% drop is ridiculous and is just revealing how little actual conviction most of the people here put into their positions. Same can be said of any meme stock here. So I get it. But there's always been both a bear case and a bull case for GME. You retards parroting "LoL, bLoCkBuStEr" at every opportunity are contributing absolutely nothing. We'll see who's right in a few months.|2020-12-09 08:53:44

f6e763|k9pwht|k9pwht|3|Buy the GRWG dip and HYFM IPO boys.    $150m in fresh institutional money GRWG closed this week setting a hard floor at $30 which we are sitting just above currently, at 8% down on the day.  Dip is purely reactionary based on dilution, not fundamentals.  Obv if they just got 150m in a follow on offering, they were vetted by institutions who felt comfortable paying $30 for bulk shares.  Most of the float is also locked between insiders and institutions.  Blackrock holding $70m btw.  Bet we get a good few % bounce this week and this thing rockets again around next ER.  Play accordingly.  HYFM IPO is crazy crazy hot in the weed world right now.  20x oversubscribed.  Shitty company.  Probably rip out of gate, dump, then pump hard again then die slow over years barring any major maneuvering on their part.  PLTR style pattern over next few weeks/months though I expect  Carry on and god speed tardos|2020-12-09 09:54:51

Or is the bookmaker just holding out waiting until the bidding up subsides and then opening to market?  Hypothetically if I had an order for $105 and was somehow first in line would I be alerted when I get my share?   Or are the institutional buyers flipping some shares?

f7h5il|k9pwht|k9pwht|3|Currently all in on PLTR, but I recommend anyone who was interested in GME just to keep an eye on it. The main catalyst is done (so all the meme status/short squeeze theory is still the main thing). IV has most likely dropped and will begin to expand in the coming weeks. This means at any point GME will most likely have some sort of big move (in either direction).  I would recommend anyone to take advantage of expanding IV by looking into calendar spreads and diagonal spreads. What makes GME so great (as a premium seller) is how stupid high the IV is.   Purchasing LEAPs and shorting calls against it would be a good option. Buy-writes (covered calls) or selling cash-secured puts would also be a great move. You can use any premium to fund FDs if you insist (I do not recommend).   If PLTR has a big move where I am forced out of my position, I will look into getting into GME if its still low(ish). It's impossible to resist that IV.|2020-12-09 14:53:51

f7ionu|k9pwht|k9pwht|6|Got in on AI at $94 for about 40k. Mark my words, this is the next PLTR. They provide a ML SaaS platform and infra to make it easy for developers to build ML apps. The area is growing like crazy and to date AI has mostly been accessible only to companies with the resources to hire data engineering teams in addition to data scientists. Making the data engineering team a platform instead can save companies a lot of money and let them focus on their core competencies.   I’d just like to say that even after the IPO day pump they’re valued at around 8b. Palantir was valued around 14b before its big run, now it’s around 40b. This has about half palantir’s revenue and is growing quickly. I fully expect this to double in the next month or two.|2020-12-09 15:05:38

Sorry no stimmy is getting passed and we can all feel the extension they gave themselves for the week might actually be everything they do until January.  From there we rally back up to 375 padding ourselves on our backs about vaccines only to realize we have to pay for the bill due in march- april.  We sink 2 two months to find a rally in may for earnings. Then go down for the next 8- 9 months.  No need to help an economy when there's no Covid and interest rates will have to be raised once we realize how much cash we spent.

f638y8|k9pwht|k9pwht|4|Next 5 weeks, I think Silver should be watched closely.  Any big swing up could turn into a gamma squeeze of sorts (since there's a ton of January contracts outstanding on paper silver like SLV).  We all know JPM and the big boys like to manipulate metals though (see Gold moving right to $1800 on November contract expiry last month).  Silver's more interesting because the overall float is much smaller, so the option sellers could theoretically lose control more easily in a gamma squeeze situation.  Worth looking out for imo.  I think it'd take a quick run of Silver to around 28-30 to really make a big gamma squeeze north of 35, and it'd have to happen before December 31.

Who knows the next time it will be this low because you know after this, TSLA will never go red ever. I read a report on the motley fool that said TSLA is like gambling, but if that's the case i'm using a rigged deck. Thank you for your consideration.  TLDR: pump the stock.

f6ofk7|k9pwht|k9pwht|2|AAPL holding up really nicely despite what could have been a pressure selling week as funds unload some of their big holdings to get into IPOs--shows you the strength of AAPL, and how things like DASH and AI are definitely not as hot as when SNOW ipo'd.   Not a terribly exciting play, but AAPl calls are a pretty solid bet to do well in December.  &#x200B;  been buying on dips:  jan15 125's|2020-12-09 11:13:57

It'll make EV's affordable and palatable for the Honda Civic buying masses. It's gonna be huge. All the China FUD is BS for Nio--they have so many American execs working for them.

Lipid nanoparticles are well known to be associated with short term fever, skin rash, and injection site issues. Your body detects nanoparticles as a foreign substance... almost like it is a virus, because of its size. Most of the time the issues are transient and reversible, thus I'd say the UK's warning isn't really unexpected or anything.|2020-12-09 10:05:10

Weak dollar and shitty bond yields may be the unfortunate alternative, but surely there are treasury managers in risk-on mode out there thinking about locking in some of those gains, right? Bonds are still safe and the dollar can't drop nearly as fast as the market. I don't know guys, I'm feeling some serious correction potential here.|2020-12-09 13:41:55

f6nxvx|k9pwht|k9pwht|1|Found a dangerous but neat hack on Schwab.  This lets you write naked options if you don’t have this access (eg account too small). Sometimes you go to close your long position, it will close but still show the position as open. If you’re quick, you can “sell to close” the position again, and once it finally updates, you will be short that position. I’ve done this a few times accidentally because i thought the long position hadn’t closed. This is obviously dangerous as fuck if you have a small account. I wonder it Schwab would write off any losses due to the hackiness of it|2020-12-09 11:10:12

"Elon has recently said that 30% to 40% of the value of the car could be in insurance," the Wall Street vet went on to explain. "What that means is that they can start offering their own insurance and improve margins. That's high-margin revenue."|2020-12-09 14:10:55

However, since he is in the margin call, the brokerage will probably not let him buy back the calls to resell since he's currently in the margin call.  Can someone with some experience with this offer advice?  I told him to call the brokerage and see if they'd allow him to flip the calls, but I've never been in this position.

I could talk about how it’s well below it’s all time high. Or that January options below ATH are still below a dollar... but I won’t bore you tards with that! All I have to say is they’re now thought to beat expectations by 22% and the business they did last covid and even during regular times means that this is probably at least true, if not an underestimate. Moreover, it’s about time instead of going to the moon, we dig deep in our souls and the earth to undermine the sound action of wall street but going LOW! Together, WE CAN MEME THIS STOCK!!!

f6pck9|k9pwht|k9pwht|-5|**They Laughed When I Sat Down At the Keyboard But When I Started to Trade! --**  Arthur had just cashed out on “PLTR.” The message board rang with applause. I decided that this would be a dramatic moment for me to make my debut. To the amazement of all my friends, I strode confidently over to the keyboard and sat down.  “FoobarGoop  is up to his old tricks," somebody chuckled. The crowd laughed. They were all certain that I couldn't make a single tendie.  "Can he really trade?” I heard a girl whisper to Arthur. "Heavens, no!" Arthur exclaimed "He never bought an FD in all his life... But just you watch him. This is going to be good."  I decided to make the most of the situation. With mock dignity I drew out a silk handkerchief and lightly dusted off the keys. Then I rose and gave the revolving credit line a quarter of a turn, just as I had seen an imitator of Shkreli do in a prison stretch.  "What do you think of his execution?" called a voice from the rear. "We're in favor of it!" came back the answer, and the crowd rocked with laughter.  Then I Started to Trade. Instantly a tense silence fell on the guests. The laughter died on their lips as if by magic. I filled the first few calls of Elon’s immortal ‘Funding Secured’ Shelf Offering. I heard gasps of amazement. My new friends sat breathless -- spellbound!  I traded on and as I my strike hit I forgot the people around me. I forgot the hour, the place, the breathless obsevers The little world I lived in seemed to fade -- seemed to grow dim -- unreal. Only the options were real. Only the weeklies and profits they were going to bring me.   As the last cents of my account drained away, the room resounded with a sudden roar of laughter. I found myself surrounded by a crowd of retards. How my new friends carried on! Men shook my hand -- wildly congratulated me -- pounded me on the back in their enthusiasm! Everybody was exclaiming with delight -- plying me with rapid questions... “Fool! Why didn't you buy them back when you were only 50% down?”… “Are you insane?” -- "How much of your savings did you blow?” -- "Who was your teacher?"  “*WallStreetBets is my teacher*,” I replied. "And just a short while ago I couldn't trade a note."|2020-12-09 11:20:52

f5vrmh|k9pwht|k9pwht|-6|TL;DR: My admittedly slightly 🐻🌈 on PLTR at these prices. Wait for a dip.   &#x200B;  **My play on PLTR**  I'd really like to see a pullback to \~25 (or lower ideally) ... then I would load up on calls, shares, and sell a bunch of put credit spreads. I like PLTR, but I hate these valuations... it may be I don't know enough about the company, but I have friends who work with it in DC. The problem is that the software platform requires heavy customization for every client... this is a big scaling issue..and I cannot find any data on how PLTR plans to scale to justify valuations at the SNOW level (which is where this thing would need to go to be a huge money-maker at these prices).  **The major problems I see with PLTR are:**  * Highly dependent on govts. Palantir has to be careful with profits so that it doesn't reek of perceived abuse (irrespective of actual value). They risk inquiries, GAO (Government Audit Office) audits, downsizing, and potential cancellations depending on the internal pressure. I believe this is why they are angling for surveillance, etc as those contracts are less transparent by nature, which mitigates this challenge some * Customizations - makes it tough to scale big time a la SNOW  **The good:**  * Rockstar management and backing * Super-compelling offering with what is to be the major problems at govts/corps (parsing signal from noise in the data due to data overload) * Should be majorly profitable  **Summary**  I like PLTR. I am a bit wary at these prices, since it's tough to gauge if this is a pure SaaS or a consulting company. Given Thiel's involvement, and heavy insistence on platform plays, I am inclined for this to be the former. I'd like to see a bit of pullback first and IV to come down. In the meantime, selling weekly puts to take advantage of the sky high IV.  Any other insights? Anything I missed and should be added?
