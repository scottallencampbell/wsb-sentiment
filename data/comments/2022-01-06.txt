rhj8kj|rxbxqk|rxbxqk|3|“The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms, greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge in mankind and greed, you mark my words, will not only save Tesla, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much.” -gandhi-|2022-01-06 07:11:50

ridovn|rxbxqk|rxbxqk|4|The expectation that inflation will go away is a fallacy. For over 20 years we have imported goods primarily from China and shipped them half way around the world because the economics made sense. The Chinese workers were essentially slave labor however that dynamic is changing ahead of schedule. Workers no longer want to work the 996 and there is a real middle class development. China still has not gone through the social growing pains of modern nations and they will have to.  The point is, 70% of our economy is driven by the US consumer buying cheap shit throwing it away and buying more. This is unsustainable and the descriptor that China has been exporting deflation for years now and will be now exporting inflation is accurate.

Light of light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; Who for us men and for our salvation came down from Heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man. And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He arose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; Whose Kingdom shall have no end.  And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke by the prophets.  In one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.

rhljg9|rxbxqk|rxbxqk|-7|Tesla! $TSLA is my main bet         Porsche Cars North America sold 70,025 vehicles last year, 9,419 were electric        Ford sold 27,140 Mach-Es in 2021. Ford recently said it would triple production of Mustang Mach-Es to 200,000 units by 2023. The automaker is also planning to nearly double the production capacity of the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup to 150,000 vehicles per year by mid-2023. So by mid 2023 they will be at an annual run rate of about 350,000 electric vehicles.        GM’s EV unit sales projected to reach 114k in 2022        VW sold about 400k electric cars in 2021, Mercedes about 220k and Volvo about 180k        Tesla sold 308k cars in Q4 alone and just shy of 1M cars in 2021        Tesla is projected to sell close to 2M cars in 2022        By 2023 Tesla should approach 4M cars sold, compare this to the ones mentioned above and tesla is lightyears ahead. They are also lightyears ahead in automotive software and AI, never mind new batteries around the corner! The main differentiator are their factories, built from the ground up for all electric auto manufacturing where others are using old factories and ICE staff. In Shanghai alone a tesla is produced every 38 seconds, no other company come close, they all take 10x+ to make one car.    The writing is on the wall with Austin and Berlin starting up now, 4680 batteries production ramping up, FSD getting perfected, Insurance program expanding, Solar and Powerwall/grid expanding, Tesla phone rumored in 2022 (if that happens it is a huge game changer as Apple iPhone is stalling in innovation, Tesla phone would work everywhere and use Starlink giving Tesla not only phone sales but recurring revenue from subscriptions!)    Watch tesla Y become the worlds most selling car by 2024 followed by Cybertruck.        Financials coming later this month will blow out estimates just like production/sales numbers did Q4.        Electric car adoption will explode imho, following Norway's lead where 65% of all cars sold in 2021 were electric with Tesla in a solid lead.        The writing is on the wall, we know what's coming. My estimate for stock price 2022 is $2-3K, if the phone happens then we can increase that estimate by 50%.|2022-01-06 07:31:17

Wall St is the bond market, they have complete control over it, they can short as much as they want basically, they just need to borrow it from the FED through reverse repo, short it, rinse and repeat until they get the price where they want it. My hope was that the turmoil caused by this selloff was going to attract big buys into long-term maturities, but it seems that this isn't enough, or rather nobody wants to risk getting into Wall St's way.|2022-01-06 10:09:30

They'll stop being silly eventually when they realise that future demand will be weakened. More nuclear power stations needed.
