pvbqhj|gfqjq5|gfqjq5|5|      Total nonfarm payroll employment fell by 20.5 million in April, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The changes in these measures reflect the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain it. Employment fell sharply in all major industry sectors, with particularly heavy job losses in leisure and hospitality.  This news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.|2020-05-08 07:30:09

pv5c85|gfqjq5|gfqjq5|3|**IHS Markit Week Ahead Economic Preview is here!**  *Week of 11 May 2020*  **Key Points:**  * The week ahead sees some key retail sales and industrial output numbers released, which will provide important signals as to just how steeply economies may collapse in the second quarter. Given that the PMI surveys for April showed the global economy contracting at an unprecedented rate, with manufacturing slumping at a pace not seen for 11 years, we are anticipating some gloomy news. * After US retail sales and industrial production fell at post-war record rates in March, the updates for April could make for especially grim reading. Survey data suggest the economy took a further significant lurch downwards in April. We are expecting US GDP to fall at a quarterly rate approaching double digits. * China also releases industrial production and retail sales data alongside a slew of other indicators including investment. With China having started to re-open its economy from COVID-19 lockdowns sooner than other countries, these numbers could provide important clues as to how quickly production and consumer spending might rebound. * Asia also sees first quarter GDP data released for Japan, Malaysia and Hong Kong SAR. Policy action meanwhile comes from the central bank of New Zealand. * In Europe, first quarter GDP data for the UK, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the Netherlands are published, all of which will be eagerly awaited to gain further insight into the extent to which the pandemic caused economic activity to slump as lockdowns were implemented. * Our special report this week looks at the outlook for India‚Äôs economy as it extends its lockdown.|2020-05-08 05:57:16

pvm40p|gfqjq5|gfqjq5|2|I missed the train on LOGI and pretty much everything, so in trying to do my own total noob DD (aka Google), I'm thinking Kroger. They just stocked 1700 of their stores w/ Impossible. Even as the economy reopens and restaurants follow, there's still the whole beef shortage thing + grocery stores are still gonna stay busy AF through Q2. Also, are you really gonna be praying the staff in the back is following protocol when you go out to eat? Probably not right away.  They own Ralph's, Mariano's and a bunch of others.  Earnings are estimated to be 6/18. I grabbed $36 6/26 to give me a bit more time. Hoping they break $40. P.S. my portfolio is blood red, so this could be dumb AF.

pwnvs9|gfqjq5|gfqjq5|2|lol oops, I forgot NYMEX expirations are at like 1:30PM  I had a bunch of bull put /GC spreads on IB (1720/1715). For some reason they closed out the short side of the spread but not the long side, and the long side became ITM right as the option expired.  I guess if it settles there I'm going to end up with a whole ton of short gold futures, more than my account can support... oops.  If you guys mail me your gold, I'll buy it off of you for $1714/oz lol|2020-05-08 14:39:21

pv3vdt|gfqjq5|gfqjq5|-1|Richard Burr wondering when profiting off mass suffering suddenly became a crime in this country - The Economist  Richard Burr responded against allegations: ‚ÄúJesus Christ, when did everyone get so uptight about this? I remember when we used to celebrate people who used their talent and connections to get rich from death and anguish. Even Tucker Carlson is being a little bitch about this. What‚Äôs the big deal? Didn‚Äôt we all decide this was cool in the 2008 recession? Last time I checked, using sensitive information to enrich yourself at the expense of hundreds of millions of other people was totally fine. I talked to Kelly Loeffler and Ron Johnson about cashing out, and nobody even batted an eye. What‚Äôs the point of being a senator if you can‚Äôt profit off the world‚Äôs problems? I‚Äôm making money, not losing it, but I guess jealous people have decided that becoming rich and powerful from a national tragedy is suddenly evil.

Upon waking up however, I see that the positions are still in my account and I got an email from tastywork saying that I have options in my account that are expiring and may be exercised.

I spend the last 12 months doing the following types of work out:  * mainly callisthenics - only pull-ups and dips * at home: push-ups and light weights * spent 1 month at a gym working out on the whole boy  Here I'll apply a few photos.  Relaxed;¬†[https://prnt.sc/sdqlmj](https://prnt.sc/sdqlmj)  Relaxed:¬†[https://prnt.sc/sdqlub](https://prnt.sc/sdqlub)  Flexing:¬†[https://prnt.sc/sdqm7f](https://prnt.sc/sdqm7f)  Do you think that I achieved¬†**decent results**¬†for 1 year? I am 29 years old and don't have a lot of experience in workouts before. Actually, when I was at school, I spent 3 months at the gym and I saw bigger progress but I guess that the hormones were much different when I was 18.  **I am wondering why so much difference when flexing vs relaxed state?**  Also, I would like to start doing some cardio and eat lighter dinner in order to clean the body fat on my belly. I just want to have a flat stomach, abs are not a goal of mine.¬†**Any tips are welcomed.**|2020-05-09 11:25:41
