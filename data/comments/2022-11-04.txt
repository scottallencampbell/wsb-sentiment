v175j8|yluiov|yluiov|15|Taking profits is easy, deciding to buy is easy. Cutting losses is fucking hard. Like emotionally, its really difficult to decide that you fucked up and to take an L because in the back of your mind you understand this could easily turn around with a gigantic red/green dildo in like 5 minutes. If you're in profit and sell and it happens, its like "welp, atleast i made a bit off this shit", but if you're at a loss and you sell then it reverses, it almost feels worse than if you would have just held on and it goes to zero. One of the hardest parts of trading for me.   I'm holding puts and its already blown through all my intellectual stop losses that I said I would sell at, because I just have a hard time believing this pump and understand SPY could drop 2-5 dollars in half an hour and I'd be golden. But realistically I didnt even think it would be breaking through 375 and its already busted 378. My brain is saying we see 380 today before we get to a point where I would see a profit off these puts...but my heart says fuck it, this shit is tanking.|2022-11-04 09:52:23

This market is basically impossible if you're holding positions more than a few hours at a time. I recently read an article saying that large trading firms are starting to play 0DTE options because they realize it can actually move the price in large enough quantities, full on manipulation. Games rigged as fuck. You will never be smarter or faster than an algorithm.   Did you know investment firms fight over real estate near the NY stock exchange because being a few hundred feet closer gives them an advantage? Even at the speed of light, if you are a 100ft closer to the point you're going, thats a whole .0001 milisecond to get better prices. We are out matched and out gunned and just small fish sucking off the leavings of greater predators. Never forget that.

We're currently sitting at 4%. * On inflation: "We're still where we were one year ago." - Jerome Powell * It's a bear market. * Some companies you can average into: $AMZN, $GOOGL, $AAPL, $MSFT.

v1a92q|yluiov|yluiov|9|Bears you have stocks that literally just announced they are money pits and y'all crying that your overcrowded 0DTE position didnt work out.  Short rips, pick longer dates, take profits.  Here are two examples:  Moderna up 4.6% after announcing they are severely slashing demand for vaccines and cutting future guidance.  Coinbase just told us they lost another 500M, and their entire bussiness currently relies on interest returns off their cash reserves and custodial. Also that more of the activity went offshore again, and they lost half the institutional activity. The whole positive spin on the price action is literally just "they didn't lose as many users as expected". Yeah well the practically did because their user activity became less active as they also went to go hide in staking and interest. Fidelity announces they are going to offer no-comission crypto trading. Their core business is dead with oout BTC either exploding in volume (it won't in this range bound) or in exploding value. So unless you see corn above 30k they will lose money again next Q.  Don't get into a last minute crowded trade and expect profit; short obviously idiotic movement after ERs. Stop getting caught up delta movement.   If you had shorted every irrational rally in the last two weeks with at least 1month out; they would all have been very profitable.|2022-11-04 10:13:16

v12806|yluiov|yluiov|8|Big bleeds out of large stocks this week, followed by FOMO bears crowding out trades and everyone is suprised at EOW market is moving out of delta.  No different then when people overcrowd on the way up.  Only difference is value is harder to destroy than to create; psychologically everyone is willing to accept something they own is more valuable, harder to get them to accept something is less valuable.  Bulls end up with more bagholders on every pump; while bears end up with worthless contracts. This is the asymmetric nature of why you can see a 10% pump on nothing but then only a 5% pull back. Unless bagholders sell, they are the support.   Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.  Get out of trades before they get crowded.|2022-11-04 09:18:45

v0u2me|yluiov|yluiov|10|Denial phase.  Build up as much bullish energy as you can so that when sentiment is finally obliterated, the reversal is that much harsher - it's really over etc. Calamity, bulls are bearish AF and embittered.  That's the end of the bear market - when the last bull dies. We haven't seen a final, brutal capitulation yet, just a grind down with too much bullish resistance. Way too much risk-on behavior these past several months to say we've had that Come-To-Jesus moment.  For bears, don't lose sight of how brutal bear market rallies can be. A bear market rally's job is to convince you the bottom is in (while stoking risk-on sentiment among the bullish faithful). It just doesn't add up that we're at a bottom; at the very least, we'll retest the lows.   The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

v0du5o|yluiov|yluiov|6|If you're gonna gamble, at least try to find some sort of slight statistical advantage to base your trades on. One example is that Gold & Silver tend to rise on Fridays and fall on Mondays/Tuesdays. Obviously, this is not always the case, and it's a rather slight historical advantage, but you have to take any edge you can get if you're actually trying to beat these markets. Another thing to think about is bid/ask spreads. If you're trading options with large bid/ask spreads, you're making it almost mathematically impossible to actually profit over the long term. You gotta trade stuff with the tiniest bid/ask spreads to give yourself a chance|2022-11-04 05:44:40

v1dg1u|yluiov|yluiov|-2|People always want to think you need fancy charts and shit but in reality you just need the ability to draw a straight line.  [https://imgur.com/a/BAzqs0c](https://imgur.com/a/BAzqs0c)  This is a perfect example of how shit works. Find a trend line, draw a straight line, when it breaks the trend line generally speaking it goes in the opposite direction. When it broke that first bullish trendline it went sideways for a bit and then started going down again. When it broke the Bearish trendline it established, instead of continuing to go down it instantly snapped down like 50 cents and retook the trendline. Its a good example because I had that bearish trendline drawn like 20 minutes before it happened but it snapped EXACTLY to where it was on that one candle thats floating into space and then continued to go down from there.   Straight lines are king, fuck all that complicated shit, 9/10 if you draw a straight line and it breaks it, it will reverse for a while. This is one of the rare times it retook the trendline and continued to crash|2022-11-04 10:34:13

v0kv29|yluiov|yluiov|-17|Whats with the hatred for multi-paragraph posts on here now a days. Is one or two sentences really how you guys think and convey ideas? Is that really how simplistic your minds are? Like, you take one or two steps down a train of thought and you're psychologically exhausted. Your double digit IQs can't possibly contemplate a well reasoned and thought out response to why someone believes something will happen. Discourse has been reduced to "lol ber fuk" and "lol bull fuk" on this sub and its sad.   If your attention span is measured in seconds regard, newsflash...maybe "investing" isnt for you. Maybe the "positions" you're currently holding within your "portfolios" aren't actually a good idea. Maybe you're just fucking gambling. Like all gamblers, you will go on runs where you make a bunch of money and feel like a genius, but in reality you were just lucky and will eventually end up losing it all when your low IQ and Ego and up enticing you to go all in on a "free money" play. Keep buying your low IQ lottery tickets, idiots, see where it leads you.  I have 4 different MBAs from Stanford, Yale, Harvard, and Donda University. My iq is measured in the quadruple digits and my net worth is in the MILLIONS. You're reading these words right this very fucking minute, idiot. Oops, you just did it again. Oops. Fucking idiot.
