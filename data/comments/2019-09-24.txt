I had them cook it separate from all the meat so I'm getting the true all-plant hippie techno science, and I'm impressed by the fact that if I close my eyes, I could mistake this for a gas station burger made with mystery meat that I'd trust to probably be mostly beef. Maybe it tastes better when grilled, I think they microwave it when you ask for it cooked separately so I guess it *would* taste like gas station burger.

She would never have been so public about this decision if she didn't already have something that might stick.   Think about how dumb she would look if she goes through the motions of impeachment just for it to backfire in her face. It would essentially solidify Trump's chances of winning 2020. She would make Democrats look like idiots.  I (am hopefully too naive) believe that she's got something on Trump and that's why she's proceeding with this. She's been so coy about impeachment until now.|2019-09-24 16:59:41

1c8zzb|d8llr4|d8llr4|5|Again here is what caused the dump.  1)Trump talked shit about China's trade practices for no reason, dampening confidence in trade talks.  2)Consumer confidence came in ~ 8 pts lower than projected (125.1 v 133) due to trade war concerns.  TLDR: Mango fucks the markets|2019-09-24 14:16:12
1cecm6|d8llr4|d8llr4|5|This could really be a catalyst. If Dems can convince China that they don’t have to make a deal with Trump, it’s over for the markets.

Doing well so far, just need to ride it out.  &#x200B;  A part of me looks at my original put, the top of my spread now and sees the full potential that the spread is going to limit me on, but knowing how many times I did get burnt on a reversal, I still think I should be ok with the bottom leg I bought.|2019-09-24 10:54:02
