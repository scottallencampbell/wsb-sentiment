k3n7qa|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|260|Preemptive RH Status Update (hopefully mods create new thread soon):   Identified: We have identified that today will be another volatile opening, so we are letting you all know that we will be stepping out of the office before the markets open.  We sent a message to our Bangledesh IT Team's aol email address, and he responded that once the goats have been fed he will update the Status Page.  We commend Azad for correcting the DST problem yesterday once we explained to him what it is.  According to our research we have determined that the calendar will not throw any new "surprises" (like DST or Leap Year) at us any time soon.        Investigating:  As suspected, we isolated the problem.  Our office only has 1 outlet, and unfortunately we tripped the master surge protector.  Just envision Clark Griswald's Christmas house decorations scene and you'll get the idea.  After a few emergency meetings and a very long lunch, the Committee agreed to send Billy's wife to the Dollar Tree to buy a second surge protector.  We will continue to keep our fingers crossed and ignore all request for comments from you and the media until we have cleared US airspace.|2020-03-10 06:40:59

k51ds8|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|24|This market is so dumb I've become numb to it. Had I lost $10k in a week a year ago, it would've been proof that I should never ever attempt playing the market.  I lost $30k today and feel nothing. It's all monopoly money anways since they're all long puts expiring at the end of the month. No realized losses = why should I give a shit. It's like the world is trying to play chicken with me as if I had anything to lose. If the economy, run by the dumbest fuck to ever hold tiller, runs aground the beer virus iceburg and shits itself, I'll be rich. If it somehow miraculously recovers despite *already being due for a recession* while in the midst of a global pandemic being vaguely warded off by the prayer candles of the least-qualified person in history to deal with this situation, I'll have a job by the end of the summer.  &#x200B;  I mean, fuck, I have a kid on the way. I'm having a kid in the middle of a recession. What the fuck.  &#x200B;  *Edit*: Guys, I really appreciate it, behind the guise of our stupid juvenile humor here is actually a really amazing and caring community. This post is mostly in fun, me and my family are totally fine. My wife and I have had long talks about our acceptable risk levels and what we think is happening and we're both fine. I spent 1/4 of our liquid assets buying $65k worth of long puts in late February. They're all printing and we're happy with where we're at. We were up $80k yesterday, but because we both think this isn't the bottom, we cashed out only 1/4 of them and are otherwise riding this thing down. The "$30k lost" refers to the fact that we're "only" up $50k today, which is still the best trading week I'll have in my life. We're doing really well and, even if we weren't, we'd be okay. This was a calculated risk and we're by no means endangering our or our future children's future.  For real, guys, much appreciated, but don't worry. Just stay on your puts and keep up the autism.|2020-03-10 15:20:12

k3sjgx|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|14|SEC is coming after leveraged and inverse funds  Letter from Direxion funds text following:   Dear Shareholder: The Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) has proposed regulations that may limit your ability to trade leveraged and inverse funds (‚ÄúL&I Funds‚Äù). The proposed regulations are contained in SEC Release No. 34-87607 (‚ÄúRelease‚Äù), which can be found here. The proposed regulations, if adopted by the SEC, will require you to provide extensive financial and personal information to your brokerage firm or financial advisor who, after review and evaluation of your financial and personal information, will decide for you whether you are sufficiently ‚Äúcapable of evaluating the risks‚Äù of using L&I Funds. It is possible that you will not be permitted to continue to use L&I Funds if your brokerage firm or financial advisor deems you ‚Äúincapable‚Äù of adequate risk assessment‚Äîeven if you affirmatively represent that you understand and accept the risks of L&I Funds. The proposed Rules also may cause brokerage firms to cease offering L&I Funds given the unprecedented and burdensome due diligence requirement. The SEC has proposed the new regulations because it believes that you may be incapable of understanding the characteristics and risks of L&I Funds and making your own informed trading decisions. The SEC has not provided any data or evidence in support of this belief and, as you know, Direxion provides comprehensive disclosure of the risks and characteristics of the L&I Funds in our Prospectuses and other materials, which the SEC has not indicated is inadequate in any away. (Appendix A below summarizes a few of the many risks from the Direxion Prospectus.) The belief that investors cannot be trusted to understand clearly disclosed risks is an unprecedented, alarming and notable departure from the bedrock principles of the capital markets and of how the SEC regulates the offering of other securities. The SEC is seeking public comment on the proposed Rule. Direxion encourages you to provide comments. Please be thoughtful, comprehensive and detailed in your comments to ensure that the SEC understands your perspective as a user of L&I Funds. Please feel free to provide general comments on the appropriateness of such unprecedented regulation and consider addressing any or all of the following topics: ‚Ä¢ A statement that you understand the characteristics and risks of L&I Funds. ‚Ä¢ A description of some of the risks of L&I Funds, including the risk associated with holding these daily beta products for longer periods of time. (Feel free to use your own language or language from the Prospectus or Appendix A.)     ‚Ä¢ The SEC believes that many users of L&I Funds do not monitor their investments. Tell the SEC that you do monitor your L&I Fund positions. Helpful information may include some description of the frequency with which you log-in to your brokerage account. ‚Ä¢ Your opinion on the notion that your brokerage firm should have the right to decide whether you are sufficiently ‚Äúcapable‚Äù to assess risk, or to disqualify you from trading L&I Funds or any other publicly offered investment. ‚Ä¢ A description of the warnings that your brokerage firm already provides in connection with your investments in L&I Funds. In connection with this, given the disclosure of the Prospectus and the attention in the media and the warnings provided by your brokerage firms, do you think it is likely that you would fail to understand the risks of L&I Funds? ‚Ä¢ Your opinion of whether your prior use of L&I Funds should automatically qualify you to continue trading L&I Funds under the proposed regulations. You may submit your comments here. You can also call us with any questions at 877-437- 9363. Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and your continued trust in Direxion. Sincerely, Robert D. Nestor President|2020-03-10 07:58:34

k3t4s6|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|53| Preemptive RH Status Update #2 (hopefully mods create new thread soon):  **Identified**: We have identified the coffee shop we are going to at 9:25am.  Mandatory office meeting in order to discuss the Labor Day party later this year.  Our unofficial motto at RH is "Always Be Prepared".    We just received an email from Azad, our IT guy in Bangladesh.  He still uses an aol account, so his email was pushed to our gmail spam account.  We have asked for help from anybody on Fivrr to help us change our settings.  He informed us that the goats have been fed, and he is about to hop on his bike to recharge the car battery that powers his laptop.  Azad assures us that once the market opens he will be able to update the Status Page showing all outages.      Once again, we commend Azad for correcting the DST problem yesterday once we explained to him what it is.    According to our research we have determined that DST or Leap Year is not scheduled this week.    **Investigating**:  We have updated our OS to Windows Vista, which we feel confident will correct all of our problems.  Additionally, due to the unforeseen tripping of the surge protector in our office yesterday, we are banning the use of the waffle iron during the opening of the market.     We are 50% confident that with these extreme measures we will be operational by 2pm (est).

Same thing is going to happen here. Major events will keep getting cancelled, people will travel less each day until we grind to a halt. I'm not saying this is the end of the world.

That may actually be a silver lining for any of the NA shale players who manage to weather this storm. Once that reserve is tapped, all bets are off. The recovery factor of strategic reserves is something that hasn't been adequately studied (anyone who tells you otherwise is selling you a false promise), and it may be that KSA could actually discover their recovery abilities are seriously hamstrung.    Russia is unwise to try and compete with KSA. But I have to imagine that the country hurt most by this will be Iran, as China will stop "secretly" buying the cheap Iranian oil and buy the now cheap KSA, etc oil.

k3vi3q|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|7|The most important thing to remember is that finding the bottom is a process not an event.  The past two weeks, the market has reflexively been trying to buy upwards to kick us out of this in the hopes that the coronavirus is a temporary problem.  That is a very natural part of the market correction cycle.  Today is another example of the market attempting to kick out of the correction on the hopes that the coronavirus can be contained quickly and the federal government will take fiscal stimulus actions.  I happen to believe that yesterday was not the bottom so I'm being patient and waiting to see what this bounce looks like.  Markets are hoping that the US outbreak doesn't follow the path of Italy's, so we're in a holding pattern until we have much more testing done in the US.  I can fully accept being wrong which is why I'm only taking temporary/quick trades with my option account.|2020-03-10 08:35:24

k45fuv|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|13|I said it this morning and I'll say it again for Trumps fake ass little baby pump:  **A stimulus that targets to increase spending will not help when the issue the markets are responding to is an outside threat to supply chains.**  To make it simpler for the dumb fucks, the reason the market is floundering over the last few week is not because spending is down, it is because coronavirus exposed existing concerns about a weakening Chinese consumer market, a breakdown in manufacturing and supply chains in China, and other market fundamentals that have ballooned over the longest bull run in history. The issue was not consumers in the US didn't have the money to spend, it's the the supply could not satisfy the demand.   The markets are concerned now because as this hits Europe and the US we have our own issues with lockdowns, quarantines, and other breakdowns in our internal supply chains. Once again it's not that consumers can't afford to spend on goods. It's because the goods may get stuck along the process, or they may not be manufactured if the supply chain has any stops in the US.   Trump is a bloviated idiot and is using techniques you should be using when the issue is demand is weak because jobless rates are high, people are scared and saving more spending less, etc. That's when cutting Fed interest rates or giving tax breaks help stimulate spending. It won't do anything to actually stop the bleeding here because the issue isn't in our core financials, it's in people lacking confidence in our response to the outside threat and seeing the mixed FUBAR messaging rather a calm, coherent response.   To make matters worse, even if the Recession doesn't hit now it will hit someday and Trump is weakening our responses to get out of Recessions because in those cases the issue WILL be on the demand side.|2020-03-10 10:21:26

They have been hedging politically by saying they are still open to talks with Saudi Arabia.   Saudis are trying to ramp up pressure as fast as they can to bring things to a quick end. They went from saying they will increase production to over 10 MMbo/d in April to saying they will increase to 12.3 MMbo/d. Previous price wars have been months or year long affairs that really hurt SA, so they probably want to avoid that. Especially since it could threaten MBS‚Äôs position if it goes on a long time, and they are in the middle of trying to diversify economy (using oil revenues).|2020-03-10 09:39:04

k4dsz0|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|11|Here‚Äôs some math I‚Äôve done for Corona and someone can tell me if I‚Äôm crazy.    So South Korea has probably done the most effective testing and has given us the most accurate numbers. They show Corona as having a .6% lethality rate.    Currently the US has 3.8% lethality. That leads to two assumptions for me, either it is 6x as deadly here or we have a lot more infected people that just don‚Äôt know. I am assuming the latter.    So using South Korea again as the accurate baseline I‚Äôm going to assume 6x times more people are infected here in the US than the numbers show. We currently have 750ish on record, so I‚Äôm saying the actual number of those infected is 4500.     Our first case was on January 20th, about 50 days ago. That means that if we assume the 4500 is the correct number, the disease spreads by a rate of about 1.18x a day. Assuming no action is taken and everyone is susceptible, that would put everyone in the US infected about 120 days from now or July 8th.     Now that is worse case. But if we assume countries shut down at around 1000 deaths. At a growth rate of 1.18x a day, that gives us 22 days until a major US shutdown, or April 1st.    In conclusion, stock up on supplies before April 1st and possibly look at puts for April/May.|2020-03-10 11:41:19

k4d7rx|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|11|Posting this again so bulls actually know the magnitude of what we are dealing with:   'We are 10 days away from the hospitals getting creamed,' warns former homeland security adviser The U.S. is a little more than a week away from a health care crisis related to the new coronavirus, according to the man who once advised President Donald Trump on how to respond to pandemics.  "We are 10 days from the hospitals getting creamed,‚Äù Tom Bossert, who was Trump‚Äôs homeland security adviser until he was ousted in 2018, told NBC News. **Bossert was never replaced, and Trump eliminated the national security council jobs related to disease outbreaks.**  In an op-ed in The Washington Post published Monday, Bossert said that unless the U.S. closes schools, halts public gatherings and takes other steps to reduce community transmission, the country is headed for the sort of crisis Italy is now facing, with hospitals overwhelmed by elderly people in need of critical care.  ‚ÄúSimply put, as evidence of human-to-human transmission becomes clear in a community, officials must pull the trigger on aggressive interventions,‚Äù Bossert wrote. ‚ÄúTime matters. Two weeks of delay can mean the difference between success and failure. Public health experts learned this in 1918 when the Spanish flu killed 50 million to 100 million people around the globe. If we fail to take action, we will watch our health-care system be overwhelmed.‚Äù|2020-03-10 11:35:44

k4hl27|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|5|From Schwab whenever I try to make a trade:  >Extreme Market Conditions  >Extreme market conditions occur during periods when significant events (such as substantial interest rate movements, economic and geopolitical events, or other factors) result in pronounced uncertainty in the fixed income marketplace. During extreme market conditions, investors may experience a shortage of liquidity and divergent prices, making obtaining quotes that are fair, consistent, and reasonable more challenging.  >Another outcome of extreme market conditions is that clients may experience an increase in the time it takes to execute a fixed income order due to delays in the order-handling process. They may also see fewer quotes and/or a wider range of prices than normal for a given security, as well as larger "bid/ask" spreads (i.e., the difference between the prices at which market participants are willing to buy and sell a given bond). Additionally, while Schwab may make efforts to notify clients when it believes a given price may not represent fair value during normal market conditions, during extreme market conditions such efforts may not be possible. Schwab may also take other steps, such as changing the parameters by which we evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of price quotes and execution prices, or other thresholds that determine whether we will execute a client's fixed income order.  >Please consult your Bond Specialist for further details or questions related to these types of events and the possible impacts on fixed income trades.  One guy used up practically the entire order book for a big sell yesterday and pushed down a bond fund that's 30% T-bills down by 2% for an hour. I'm glad Schwab is telling their clients to cool their tits when making orders.|2020-03-10 12:16:43

Last night‚Äôs selloff left the S&P 500 index down 19% from its recent peak - close to entering a Bear Market...but not quite.

k4uz9h|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|4|Something to consider, though will probably mean nothing in this totally fear driven and irrational market that plunges up and down on nothing, is that per barrel price of oil is directly correlated to Airline ticket pricing. Fuel is the second largest cost to airlines after labor, so much so that airlines have to open positions to hedge against the rising price of oil to ensure that ticket prices don't skyrocket exponentially upon per barrel pricing skyrocketing. Everybody is asking why Airlines are up, and it's most likely just Trump pump and manipulation, but the price of oil tanking just gave airlines a hedge against declining sales. Thanks to the price of oil cratering fuel costs haven't been this low in decades. Again, I wouldn't disagree with anybody that claims this is just market manipulation and Trump pump.|2020-03-10 14:21:50

k4kftg|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|6|I guess the mods didn't like my DD post so I think it is ok to post in daily discussion:   For those not in the know, AAL has been firing (accounts shutdown) thousands of customers and confiscating miles/flights. This is a heterogeneous group (some admitedly had done legal, but tricky techniques to bypass the supposed limit of CC sign up bonuses for AA miles) but some are high value paying customers who spent 10s of thousands of dollars on flights every year. Speculation began in the airline mileage community in January that this was an effort to cut costs on the balance sheet. This has ballooned into thousands and thousands of accounts. Little has been written about it (besides a few financial posts with some being removed and some uninformed travel blogs). This has spill over to Citi and Barclays which will see significant downturn in 1)new applications and 2)maintained customers.  https://milestomemories.com/aa-tells-barclays-none-of-your-business-on-aa-shutdowns/?utm_source=BoardingArea&utm_medium=twitter#comment-769239|2020-03-10 12:43:28

k4cmk4|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|7|'We are 10 days away from the hospitals getting creamed,' warns former homeland security adviser The U.S. is a little more than a week away from a health care crisis related to the new coronavirus, according to the man who once advised President Donald Trump on how to respond to pandemics.  "We are 10 days from the hospitals getting creamed,‚Äù Tom Bossert, who was Trump‚Äôs homeland security adviser until he was ousted in 2018, told NBC News. Bossert was never replaced, and Trump eliminated the national security council jobs related to disease outbreaks.  In an op-ed in The Washington Post published Monday, Bossert said that unless the U.S. closes schools, halts public gatherings and takes other steps to reduce community transmission, the country is headed for the sort of crisis Italy is now facing, with hospitals overwhelmed by elderly people in need of critical care.   ‚ÄúSimply put, as evidence of human-to-human transmission becomes clear in a community, officials must pull the trigger on aggressive interventions,‚Äù Bossert wrote. ‚ÄúTime matters. Two weeks of delay can mean the difference between success and failure. Public health experts learned this in 1918 when the Spanish flu killed 50 million to 100 million people around the globe. If we fail to take action, we will watch our health-care system be overwhelmed.‚Äù|2020-03-10 11:30:13

k3nsjc|fgc3hy|fgc3hy|4|I was thinking SPY etc might only get to 50% retracement, but considering the 200MA will coincide with 61.8%, I'm thinking it bounces to there and then we'll see if can break the 200MA with resilience or plummet into the darkness.  That leads me to believe probably another up day tomorrow to test that, not expecting a fade today, unless we test the 200MA today too.

But I'm hoping analyst saying that it's going to keep dropping buys me a fair amount of time.     CZR 9/18p.  Cmon, there's got to be a state of emergency in Nevada/Las Vegas before September, right?  Spring and Summer conventions coming up that have a high chance of being cancelled, along with lower travel rates and people not wanting to be in communal areas (like casinos)?  I'd think it has to keep dropping.     Diamond hands is my only play today.     Also bought some cheap GUSH calls haha.|2020-03-10 08:16:55

Since RH is stuuuuuu and always switches to buy when you reload the damn page. Anyways, my inner autism told me hold since it was a huge drop and sell next day for short lose.

I've recently gotten a job where I'm able to be on my phone for the majority of my shifts, I've looked at several different investment and money making schemes but nothing has settled in my head and felt right.  The most knowledge I have is about forex, but I'm more than happy to look at other options if they are more profitable and safer.  Any resources besides the mis-informative bile of the first 5 pages of Google are also welcome since I have so much time to read and learn.  I've also seen a lot of members of this page saying that they just an app instead trading on their computer.  Basically I want to start learning the right way, I'm a calm and cautious adult who knows how to evaluate risk, and I think I'm ready to try my luck.  Thanks for your time everyone who replies to this, and I'll also thank you in advance for your patience if I hastle you with questions.  (Tried to make a post but I got hidden)|2020-03-10 11:08:54
