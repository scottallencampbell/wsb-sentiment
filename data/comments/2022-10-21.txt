If you have calls ‚Äúfuk all bears‚Äù is a good one. In fact just say that if you have puts as well. Who gives a shit and it‚Äôs a good way to take a position on something 2. Always say good morning. It makes other people feel good about themselves, but spell it in a different way that is sexually suggestive. Something like, ‚ÄúMorning fellas I just blew my load‚Äù. 3. Actually anything sexual prints here. So telling everyone about you experience with a MILF on tinder is a good way to get upvotes. Especially if it involves shitting. I give bonus points to shitting comments. 4. Say exactly the same comment over and over again. It may not have worked the first time, but there is a new turnover every minute and it might work better this time. You double down on those calls this morning, so fuck it, let‚Äôs do it with comments 5. Let people know you have personal relationships with other people on the board. Sure you don‚Äôt know then IRL, but sure to call out their username in chats whenever possible.

This can be attributed to a lack of understanding of how the two indicators work. The VIX is a measure of implied volatility, which is basically a gauge of how volatile the markets are expected to be in the near future. When there is an increase in implied volatility, it means that traders are expecting more turbulence in the markets and this often leads to selling pressure as investors seek to protect their portfolios from potential losses. However, it's important to remember that just because there is increased volatility doesn't mean that prices will necessarily fall - sometimes they can rise as well (although this tends to happen less frequently).

It also just so happens there was a shit ton of naturally occurring nuclear reactors around the Earth at the time we hypothesize life emerged here (4 billion years ago).   Naturally occurring nuclear reactors would warm water, but not to a boil, and would promote the arbitrary and continuous mixing of organic compounds over millennia, until a potential mutation of nature could possibly emerge that self replicates itself until it becomes‚Ä¶DNA. Other leading theories such as lightning strikes randomly creating the first single cell organism don‚Äôt make sense because lightning is stupid hot and would just vaporize anything it created.   I‚Äôd take a step further and say this solves part of the riddle of the Fermi Paradox. If life requires nuclear radiation to emerge, and that life becomes sentient and intelligent, then it will eventually inevitably resort to weaponizing that nuclear energy and destroying itself.

Inflation rates (acceleration of inflation) has peaked for most items, and there is data showing that rent may be peaking as well. This doesn't mean prices won't keep going up, just that the rate of their increases are beginning to slow. As a result, Fed Daly said they are going to be careful not to overshoot tightening policy.   Last CPI print was bad, but the problem is CPI a trailing indicator. The Fed wants to start tapering off the rates 'before' inflation starts to plummet--in much the same way you take cookies out of the oven before they're fully cooked. The market rallied not on hopes of a pivot, but on hopes of a soft landing, or on the hopes the cookies (inflation) will settle nicely without drastic action beyond what has already been described.|2022-10-21 14:57:02t8vns8|y9plyz|y9plyz|4|Everyone going to buy puts again and push us to 380 next week|2022-10-21 14:57:21t8vprw|y9plyz|y9plyz|5|Buls are fukt|2022-10-21 14:57:44t8vq00|y9plyz|y9plyz|4|Close the casino so I can say ‚ÄúOpen the casino.‚Äù|2022-10-21 14:57:46t8vrzz|y9plyz|y9plyz|5|We should host a WSB funeral for the bers|2022-10-21 14:58:09t8vx37|y9plyz|y9plyz|2|No way this rally continues.

The amazing thing about modern monetary theory is that not only does it have issues when consumption outstrips productivity, but it also does everything in its power to increase the consumption to productivity ratio.  That means it's not just designed to suck, it's designed to suck as badly as possible, and fall apart, and create the biggest catastrophe possible when it falls apart.   Long before you were born, the rich had plans to make themselves richer by making the poor poorer. Today, the rich have plans to make themselves richer by making the poor dead.   This is humanity's consequence for giving all the wealth and power to people who are incapable of measuring wealth and power in absolute, instead measuring it relatively. Society stops being about building wealth, and starts being about destroying wealth for people who feel "wealthier" when their wealth has decreased by a smaller amount than those around them.|2022-10-21 12:15:00t8c78k|y9plyz|y9plyz|6|Red by close|2022-10-21 12:46:59t8d61v|y9plyz|y9plyz|5|pivot clowns are back again. yeah fed will pivot 11th times in the last 10 months jerks. go find yourself a better lie to pump.|2022-10-21 12:53:17t8h3l1|y9plyz|y9plyz|5|SPY barely 2 bucks from where we were a month ago, what a boring month ü•±ü•±ü•±|2022-10-21 13:19:22t8kmtv|y9plyz|y9plyz|5|#free my boi Walter Bloomberg|2022-10-21 13:43:00t8prlk|y9plyz|y9plyz|5|NFLX continues to ass rape my puts.

Inverse everything, assume anything you are told is a lie and the opposite is true. Sure SNAP dropped 24% overnight, but that just means it can go up that much today! Buy that shit now. 2. Meme stocks are your friend. WSB is a tight community where each supports the other. They wouldn‚Äôt let you down. When they say BBBY is T+35 or the short squeeZe is a week away, there is money to be made. You want friends don‚Äôt you? 3. Speaking of friends, YOLO is your friend. When your play anything it‚Äôs a game of go big or go homeless. When you have a pair of aces you ship that shit. Go all in. Every trade should be a YOLO waiting to happen. 4. Get emotionally connected with the stock (or better options) purchase. It‚Äôs something to be treasured. Sure you don‚Äôt shop or buy that companies products but you hold that shit until the profits come. Don‚Äôt puss out on me.

The U.S. central bank is likely to provide a signal at its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting as officials weigh what some see as growing risks to economic growth against a lack of obvious progress in lowering inflation from its pandemic-related surge.  "This debate about exactly where we should go, and then become more data-dependent, is going to heat up in the last part of the year here," St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said in a Reuters interview last week.  San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly added her voice to that debate on Friday during an event in Monterey, California. While acknowledging that high inflation made it "really challenging" for the central bank to step down from its rate hikes, Daly said "the time is now to start talking about stepping down. The time is now to start planning for stepping down." Investors widely expect the Fed next month to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for a fourth consecutive time, lifting it to a range of 3.75% to 4.00%.  Yet even as markets point to another large increase at the final policy meeting of the year in December, sentiment is building within the Fed to take a breather. While the process of raising interest rates is not yet finished, policymakers feel they may be at the point where further increases can be smaller in size, and are close to where they can pause altogether in order to take stock as the economy adjusts to the rapid change in credit conditions the central bank has set in motion.  That advice has been subtle: In a speech earlier this month, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard offered a list of reasons to be cautious about further tightening without overtly calling for a slowdown or pause.|2022-10-21 13:47:34t8qjw9|y9plyz|y9plyz|2|Bulls going in dry, sheesh|2022-10-21 14:22:57t8rybt|y9plyz|y9plyz|2|Big liquidation incoming spy 300 March 2023 put remind me on it|2022-10-21 14:32:27t8ym6j|y9plyz|y9plyz|2|Everyone thanks for buying more puts Monster rally Monday get ready|2022-10-21 15:17:18t7oou6|y9plyz|y9plyz|1|[removed]|2022-10-21 10:10:51t6stnz|y9plyz|y9plyz|2|Hoping for a flat day.

(NYSE: GME) opened just above an important support zone at the $24 mark on Friday, where the bulls continued to defend the level.  The $24 area has been tested eight times since Sept. 7, with the bears unable to break the stock down lower. Meanwhile, GameStop's relative strength index (RSI) has been slowly rising, which has caused exaggerated bullish divergence to develop.  An exaggerated bullish divergence occurs when a stock makes a series of equal bottoms over a specific timeframe, while the relative strength index (RSI) oscillator makes a series of higher lows. Bullish divergence suggests that the bulls are regaining control and can mark an eventual break up from a sideways trading pattern.  ![img](emotet5_2th524275)|2022-10-21 10:53:05t7whw2|y9plyz|y9plyz|1|Any plays on BBBY?|2022-10-21 11:02:32t7x53b|y9plyz|y9plyz|1|I told you guys yesterday the bear markets over|2022-10-21 11:06:49t7xlw7|y9plyz|y9plyz|1|The bottom is in get amongst it|2022-10-21 11:09:53t7xwrx|y9plyz|y9plyz|1|Our administration fighting inflation!

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.  Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.   As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck.

Price could/should fall another 60-70% from here easily.   Think about this...Disney is valued at around $185B while Netflix is at $129B. Disney actually surpassed Netflix in subscriber count (including Hulu and ESPN+ subs). The company owns Hulu, ESPN networks, all their parks, merchandising, star wars, Marvel, and all associated products and movies. The list is endless. Really, I'm more long term bullish on Disney than anything else.   However I still think market crashes hard from here. SPY under 200 by next year, hard. Disney could fall to $60/share, an absolute fire sale for a blue chip that will be a big winner over the next 5-10 years. Netflix, I'd stay away....they are slowly becoming more and more obsolete as they lose content and subscribers daily. Especially with their bs "single account login" initiative. In 5 years, all they will have is their original content. Well, 5 decent shows and some b-list movies doesn't make a company worth $128B...I give them $40B max. Hence the 70% selloff from here. And that's not even taking into account negative selling pressure from a market wide crash.
