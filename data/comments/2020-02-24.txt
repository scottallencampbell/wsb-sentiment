inlxlg|f8pouu|f8pouu|11|So if anyone followed my fuckery with schwab this morning. They said "we need 25k" to  cover the trade we let through since we turned restrictions off. I cant fund them externally, so they said I could ride out Spy 320p @ 2.90 (the absolute high) for wednesday or liquidate at a 50% loss, and liquidate other options to get them 25k. The guy said either way schwab would either sue or somehow get the money. So I panicked, and sold for a 50% loss. and liquidated options to cover the rest.   As of right now Spy at 322.23, my options would have been worth 21,800$ and I'd have been out a measly 4k.  Instead of nearly 60k.   Thanks for coming to my TED talk.|2020-02-24 11:35:18

inmp1n|f8pouu|f8pouu|22|**Reminder:**   Days that involve highly elevated volatility, force market makers to hedge throughout the day, which can lead to a lot of fakeouts and reversals. If you aren‚Äôt sure what‚Äôs going on, best to watch on the sidelines, take notes on your hunches, and see how they turn out.   I paid a lot in ‚Äútuition‚Äù figuring out how to align myself with the market on days like today. If you‚Äôre new, and determined to play, play small enough that you can comfortably lose your capital, and look at the money as an investment in your trading future.|2020-02-24 11:41:52

inehcn|f8pouu|f8pouu|11|I can‚Äôt believe I have to say this, but commodity based stocks such as GOLD and GLD do not see their growth during the day.

Also, since it‚Äôs being shilled all over the discord, if you are buying KGC options you are actually fucking retarded. Do 5 mins of research before you yeet money into something. If a ‚Äúgold‚Äù based stock is in the red today after a 2%ish growth on gold futures and you don‚Äôt see that as a red flag you deserve to lose your money.  Edit: if you want to ride the gold wave the stocks you look at are GOLD, GLD and NEM.

Now consider the fact that there are around 10,000 suggest "self-quarantined" people in the US. If the numbers start to increase in the West, which they most likely will, the effect will be even bigger.   I'm not saying that the disease itself is something to be terrified of, but the disruption to the economy from people staying home, supply chains being stopped, etc. will be quite big. And that's not even being realized by the markets yet. Some are predicting a 15-20% pullback (temporary) as China tries to restart its economy. Its like a lost quarter. Tech companies will be hit the hardest, followed by anything involved with travel and tourism.  At least that's how I'm reading this now.|2020-02-24 12:32:33

inwlee|f8pouu|f8pouu|12|$ALLY call gang stay strong!  After today's drop (and nice purchasing period) I have 850 call options and another order in for 300 if I can snag them at a good price.  CFO is presenting on Thursday at the Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum, will be great to hear what she has to say about the acquisition of CreditWorks and how it will impact their near/long term goals.  First contracts I have expire on 03/20, I'm holding strong with my diamond hands and not looking to sell at all until a week before expiry. I still have full faith that this will rebound up into the $31-$33 range in the coming months.  The WuHu Flu is killing the market, but the numbers will prevail. Hold strong boys!|2020-02-24 13:13:59

io055x|f8pouu|f8pouu|11|its a funny thing to know something like the virus is becoming a pandemic and is going to fuck world economies really hard, but also get scared when the market bumps up a little. Unlike the trade talks / earnings etc, the virus potential isn't going to respond to any news coming out. Containment failed, and it is insanely contagious. Italian mortality numbers are scary af right now. I hate having to hold through temporary optimism though.   &#x200B;  Besides this, ofc i'd rather lose money than a pandemic wipe out tens of millions.

imtye0|f8pouu|f8pouu|6|Here's my mini DD folks:  I don't see this virus being -too- bad in the west itself. Ideally, western healthcare systems will be able to deal with it and not that many people will actually die from it. I don't see the US or Europe closing borders to each other either. If Europe fails to contain the virus, then IDK man I guess it's a global pandemic. Let's hope it doesn't get to that and the EU steps up. Full border closings would be catastrophic.  All that being said, I think the country in biggest danger is India right now. That country is just waiting for a virus to come in and kill off hundreds of thousands of people. If it manages to spread over there, I think it's GG. Poor living conditions, poor econ compared to even China, out of control population size, social unrest already forming, etc. Africa, too, will get fucked but Africa's been getting fucked by itself and every other country in the world since the beginning of time.|2020-02-24 06:20:43

inytyh|f8pouu|f8pouu|3|Observation: The market has been a little frothy with lots of speculation in high IV options (calls specifically) buying in the hopes that the market will reach the stratosphere (and we will all get rich). If I was a market maker, I would mark the market down (gap down this morning) after selling a lot of out of the money calls, to make sure those options expiry worthless and I get to keep the premium. Then I would use the Coronavirus as justification for marking the market lower. Long term investors don't necessarily care about a 10% correction, but autists lose their premiums in the process. Rinse and repeat. That is how the market works. In periods of extreme IV, be careful. GL|2020-02-24 13:35:38

ingv41|f8pouu|f8pouu|2|I'm sitting here, watching CHWY trudge upwards. My thoughts:  It's not reliant on China supply chain. Millennials have been backing off of buying China made food/toys/chews because they don't know what's in it, quality control is shit. Americans in general are too lazy to go to Wal-mart or Target to get a bag of YumYum Chowhound, they can watch their NBA/MLB/NHL/NFL game at home, order some food for Chonkers off the iPad, toss in some treats and toys, and get that sweet sweet delivery schedule going.  It's fucking recession proof. How many people off Chonkers in a recession? No one. They'll give up the house before Chonkers. People will go homeless to keep Chonkers. All Chewy has to do is sort out how to market to homeless people and do sidewalk delivery and they'll be high and tight in any recession.  Oh, and some dude who probably posts on /r/investing said it was doing well. But this is WSB so why would we give that any thought?|2020-02-24 10:52:05

Didnt think he would be looking so strong this early.   But the red market is a Sanders sell off, change my mind.   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esg8yf/tipanic|2020-02-24 06:37:40

in4ojq|f8pouu|f8pouu|1|Some interesting TA this morning.  We broke well below the JPow bull channel started in October and the 50 day moving average was pretty damn close to the support of that channel.  We've had good support at 320, then below that looks like 315 but that hasn't been tested anywhere near as much as 320.  Short term RSI has been >50, which would suggest flat/pump, but short term MACD and long term of both say we have more room to run down.  We'll likely hang out here or have a small rally, then it's probably back to test 320 throughout the week.|2020-02-24 08:48:16

ing7os|f8pouu|f8pouu|-4|Honestly this is kind of "weak selling" at best in terms of market internals considering the down % and the "virus fear" news all over the place.  ADD/DEC keeps climbing after the morning plunge to -2330 level (now at -2200)  TICK is honestly not that bearish, candlestick bodies are pretty rangebound -500/+500, no candle below -1000 yet besides open one  VOLD's as negative as August 1 session at the same point in time which is expected|2020-02-24 10:46:49
