awnaa0|jmkz1s|jmkz1s|21|You had the audacity and good luck to buy the March dip.  You, like almost everyone else, made a fortune trading the big tech stocks. Among those you find your favorite race horse. You win almost every bet on this stock, and buying the dip always works.  One day the market suffers a correction and your positions take a hit. "I'm long term positive on this company, I'll buy the dip and wait" You say.  The day after that you wake up and it's a sea of red. Your favorites are declining over 3%. You say to yourself "Now is the time to go in". The stock keeps declining intraday, but you keep buying the dip, not realizing the huge position size you're building up.  The next day the correction continues. You've wiped out your initial gains and some more. You have no cash to buy any more dips. When the bell rings, your portfolio is utterly broken and so is your spirit.  You go look at futures gaining 0.34% and begin to type furiously on WSB: BEAR R FUK|2020-11-02 10:01:01

awc46u|jmkz1s|jmkz1s|17|What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.|2020-11-02 08:25:06

awq2rm|jmkz1s|jmkz1s|6|Remember a lot of traders don't have experience and started this week out with cash or were already in. As time passes this week they will add more and more to their position size, especially if it trades flat or drifts down. They will be fine at the start, but then they will slowly overexpose themselves. Then once things start getting wild they will either bail due to the volatility increase or barf up their positions from a massive loss. Expect it from them and don't let it happen to you! Don't get lulled into opening more positions during the slow parts of the week!|2020-11-02 10:23:35

What do y’all think is going to happen once we have a vaccine and another round of stimulus (in addition to an extremely accommodative FED of course)?  Turn off the mainstream media for a while, Americans are sitting on PILES of money that they are scared to spend right now.

No, you are upset cause the EV giant "NIO" with a 400B market cap, spreading quickly throughout Asia, you saw that stock every day getting shilled, it was sitting on a puny sub 50B market cap.
