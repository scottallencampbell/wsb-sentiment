x0g2uv|n5cc1t|n5cc1t|12|Futures are higher this morning, rebounding from the ‚ÄòYellen head-fake‚Äô that caused a bunch of selling yesterday afternoon. Small caps are leading the move higher, with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%. Nasdaq is up 0.6%. S&P and Dow up about 0.3%. Russell and Nasdaq also saw the brunt of the damage yesterday, giving up almost 2% each.  We do get to hear from a couple of FOMC members: Eric Rosengren, Loretta Mester, and Charles Evans. Not sure if they‚Äôre taking questions but if so you can bet they‚Äôll be asked about Yellen‚Äôs comments.   My thoughts on Yellen and the Fed: Need to listen to the audio. Not gonna type it.  ADP payrolls are due out at 0815. Economists expecting 800k jobs added in April, quite a bit more than the 517k from March. We also get ISM services data at 10am. These are a couple of key reports where the health of the economy is concerned. As always, you need to watch for the Goldilocks scenario: too hot and it means inflation and Fed tightening. Too cold and the economy is not recovering quickly or strongly enough. Though nowadays, maybe the ‚Äòtoo cold‚Äô scenario is preferred.  More earnings today as well: Hilton Worldwide just came out with a miss. GM, Allstate, and Etsy report later. After the bell we get Uber, Booking Holdings, and PayPal.|2021-05-05 05:53:07

So if you predict a price drop is the best move to buy outsider that range and just sell when it begins approaching your strike? Seems like going deep itm from barely otm is a lesser gain than just going from way OTM to ATM. I know that's because far OTM is cheap and you can load TF up..  How many of you trade this way? I've usually leaned towards ITM to leverage while having a higher chance of success but it seems like if you don't get greedy you can play pretty far OTM and do alright.

x2nmh8|n5cc1t|n5cc1t|3|NQ (Nasdaq futures) rising wedge / trend lines, broke down, back tested at double top, multiple failed break outs, now a steep hourly down trend line to watch.  I'm bearish until that hourly trend line is broken out of, until then, lower is the direction.  https://i.imgur.com/Ft2rdIY.jpg  EDIT  Also big negative divergence on daily RSI and MACD.  This does not look good in any way..  https://i.imgur.com/2OTdrL7.jpg  Wouldn't be surprised, at all, to see Nasdaq at $11,000 within a couple months if not quicker, these drops can happen REALLY fast as we've seen in this market, once they pick up some steam. Then V-shaped recovery once the big boys have stopped liquidating, margin calls and de-leveraging is completed, and the big boys then take their free Federal Reserve money, and pump it back up once all the forced selling is done. Better believe they've used the last couple weeks of quiet markets to slowly start unloading at QQQ double top, whilst retail tried chasing all those failed break outs. Now they're taking your calls premiums, taking their profits on this rally, forcing a decent pull back so they can actually buy again at semi-reasonable prices. $11,000 is still hugely over-valued, though. If Biden can get ALL his spending through, then this market will keep going higher, especially if it is without tax increases... But its all inflation, at this stage... The economy isn't getting better, but companies make more revenue and higher profits, because there's simply MORE money and everything simply costs MORE. That's not economic growth or prosperity, it is a bubble and inflation and we either prick it soon or hyper-inflate.  That's why I stick bearish on stocks especially the over-priced tech names, and bullish on precious metals. It hasn't worked out yet, but eventually we'll either get a collapse in stocks with the Fed going absolutely berserk with money printing, or we'll continue higher and higher and higher and hyper-inflation is the name of the game and my gold investments will do way better than my smaller bear bets on the market (especially QQQ/Nasdaq).|2021-05-05 16:01:44

Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.  **SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **96.94** which gives us a total value of:  #$969,400  No TA and no DD needed.

This will interact with ihealth and share data that is collected on that app with your doctor. The only catch is that your doctor will have to adopt well healths Oscar EMR platform (and pay their recurring revenues) in order to have this option available to their clients/patients. The only app in Canada that interacts with the iPhone.  This will be a big driving force behind forcing clinics to adopt the Oscar EMR platform provides by well (one of the highest margin aspects of Well) and will likely lead to each of these clinics adopting other offerings by WELL as well. Huge news for well health and all Canadians as it will allow anyone to collect health data and share it with their doctor to improve health outcomes!!|2021-05-05 08:15:11

x34fiy|n5cc1t|n5cc1t|3|Looking forward to re-investing in TLRY at $9 - $10 or so.. I've never bought them before, but APHA I've held a ton of over the years (sold $5.70 average for $13.50 or so back before the really big run up, but now I don't feel so bad for having sold, I'll get a good entry again I'm quite sure, need to be patient with weedstocks, they go up and down a lot more than anyone tends to expect), buying TLRY for the APHA assets/sales/distribution (also Sweet Water, Broken Coast, and CC Pharma revenue), and the special extra pieces TLRY provides APHA with to really expand internationally, especially one day, since the NUU deal years back was just a massive shit-burger designed to enrich the NUU shareholders, which was only on the market for a few weeks before APHA bought it out, at the PEAK of the 2017/early 2018 weedstocks bubble, fucking idiot move that was, right after they made a beautiful deal buying Broken Coast, which kept me bullish, whilst all these fucking NUU shareholders destroyed the price cashing out literally for the next year or two APHA was always a laggard because the NUU shareholders made BANK basically no matter what APHA was trading at, so they kept on divesting and divesting, but they're finally all gone, other than the long-term believers at least.  TLRY at $9 - $10 is like APHA at $7.50 - $8.50 or so? Yeah, that's a great entry for this new combined company IMO. But $15ish? Naaaaah. Not without some big news like US legalization bill moving forward / vote on it coming up soon (which IMO is still many months away, so plenty of time for TLRY to drop another 33%).  Great long-term investment at $10 or so though, I do believe.  The only thing, which I thought of today is... I'm not 100% sure we'll ever really SEE Canadian LP's selling lots of weed in the USA... Like, OK, beer/alcohol, there's a huge international market for, and Canada/USA trades a lot of that back and forth... But we DON'T trade cigarettes back and forth, like, at all. Completely different brands here in Canada than USA. You won't find Camels or Marlboros in Canada, and you won't find Belmonts or Du Maurier in USA... So... Is this actually ever going to happen, cross-border cannabis trade and Canadian LPs actually really benefitting a ton from US legalization? I know we have the production to fill in any gaps for USA in their early days, maybe they will allow wholesale bulk sales to US MSOs / companies, for re-branding, until production in USA ramps up to cover the demand of the whole country that the MSOs can't meet... But once they CAN meet it, does Canadian weed actually have much of a place in USA? Just like Canadian tobacco doesn't... Makes you wonder if this isn't just some pipe dream. I know Canada is supplying a lot of international medical uses, especially over in EU countries... But eventually I'd think those countries want their own domestic production to meet demand and help bolster up some jobs and economic activity for their own people, not just send all the profits back to Canada, long-term. Canada can fill in the gaps initially, could be a few good years coming up... But really long term, I'm just not sure the Canadian LPs will have that much of a role internationally.. I know CGC and ACRG have a deal, or had a deal, not too sure where that stands.. That once USA legalizes, CGC would take ownership of ACRG. Things like that may work, Canadian LPs buying USA MSOs, and then using that company as a seperate entity to do business in the USA, with different name / branding and production actually occurring domestically down there.. But that means other than CGC and VFF (with greenhouses in Texas easily converted for cannabis, with a license needed I'm sure), all the other LPs probably need to do something similar and actually GROW the weed in the USA. Which isn't how these LPs grew/designed themselves, with huge production facilities here in Canada, meant for long-term export to the world... Who knows if that ever becomes a reality. The good news is, these green houses could be utilized to grow poppies, coca, mushrooms (with a lot of conversions, for that one), and the labs these companies have built can be partially re-purposed for extraction. Long-term, all drugs need to be legalized, and LPs do have the greenhouse space to grow the poppies and coca as well as the cannabis and synthesize meth and such in already existing assets, just need to do some conversions, some upgrades, buy some new equipment, etc... But that may be another way to play them long-term, if you believe all drugs should and could be legalized in the next decade (via prescriptions to addicts, not sold in beer/cannabis stores, lol).|2021-05-05 18:07:48

Mentioned:	NOK  Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK) shares are trading higher by 4.27% at $4.88 Monday morning, despite a lack of company-specific news from the session. Last week, the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter EPS and sales results.  Nokia reported quarterly earnings of 8 cents per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of 1 cent per share. Nokia also quarterly sales of $6.12 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $5.83 billion.  Nokia is a leading vendor in the telecommunications equipment industry. The company's network business derives revenue from selling wireless and fixed-line hardware, software, and services.  Nokia's technology segment licenses its patent portfolio to handset manufacturers and makes royalties from Nokia-branded cellphones. Nokia operates on a global scale, with most of its revenue from communication service providers.|2021-05-05 09:51:36

Only IWM is not in the green and lagging but that is where all the stocks are that will win big in the next 6 months.  As I had mentioned in prior posts. If you are playing with options, try and be long SPY and press your bets when the market gives us weeks like this past week.
