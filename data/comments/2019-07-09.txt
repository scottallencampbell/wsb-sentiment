te9bfr|cazfen|cazfen|3|Hey y'all! Been hitting the books, crunching data and downing redbulls, trying to wrap up my dissertation which is sucking the life out of me. Luckily the last few days have been stellar for profits - I hope you've found the advice from the last few posts useful. Recommended options so far have been on point!  Again, plenty of opportunities to make $$$$$ on both sides. Bulls and bears can easily win in this market. Just a matter of timing your entries/exits right, picking some good stocks and being patient. Here are the stocks I'll be watching closely. Apologies if it's a bit rushed - I've got some deadlines to meet asap and the time dwindles.  &#x200B;  **Stocks for the BULLISH crowd:**  * PYPL is a bullish power play rn. So is CRWD (can moon any second!) * APPL and FB ain't looking too shabby if you're feeling bullish and want to play a FAANG. Keep an eye on TWTR, LK and XLNX as well * SQ and ROKU should keep climbing up. Monster potential for SQ til the end of the week. * If you want a longer dated call, ZEN and TWLO, and NYT won't let you down  &#x200B;  **Stocks to play if you're feeling BEARISH:**  * COST, WMT, CMG, LYFT (Lyft puts only for a day or two... It should pick back up after) * Bear power play: SFIX, NFLX * TSLA. Very few reasons to be bullish, plenty to be bearish. If trading TSLA is your thing make sure you think twice before getting calls. Flip a coin 3 times, see if it lands on its side.  &#x200B;  STAY AWAY FROM BA/CRM/BABA/SHOP (if you want your trades to be better than pure gambling). These are treacherous stocks atm.  Will try to check in later to answer any questions but will likely be busy until tomorrow morning.  Good luck trading tomorrow, gang. Let's get them|2019-07-09 21:38:05

tc0i0l|cazfen|cazfen|10|Here's a post I made on last night's forum, in case you're feeling shaken up by futures and want to channel your inner bull/bear. Have a solid trading day y'all.   \-----------------------  Many of the stonks recommended yesterday were on fire! Let's see if the magic TA eight ball keeps it rollin. Again, individual stock plays seem a lot safer and potentially more lucrative. Check out the charts yourself and pick wisely :).  If bearish, I think the following are due for a bit of a drop that could print solid tendies on the daily:  * HUM might drop for a few days (and it's a good stock for swing trade IMO), but will continue it's uptrend and with the recent mention at Barron's and upgrades, it's a great addition to the portfolio * NFLX, Illumina, LULU and Adobe are bear powerplays for the day * If SHOP drops and you have a put, hold overnight * Still very bearish on TSLA until earnings. After that it depends on guidance, and who knows with this company  If you're feeling bullish, wait for the drop and consider:  * CRWD calls will print tendies no matter what. There'll be some price manipulation but if you navigate the BS, it's a lucrative one * ZS, OKTA, TEAM, Z, still tons of potential to go higher * LYFT calls are a power play IMO * ROKU is also a solid gamble. Will try to test ATH and even $120 this or next week * LK and APPL should gap up soon, but you never know with these two  I'd also stay away from BA and CRM for now. Even BYND is an unreasonably expensive gamble.  Beware holding overnight unless you're feeling confident about whether we'll have a green/red day next.  Me Comprendees Tendees?|2019-07-09 06:12:55

tc9kv5|cazfen|cazfen|-3|Fuckin hate Robinhood.  Had an option that was worth like $400 for a brief couple minutes, Robinhood decided to glitch out and not fulfil the order AAAAND now it‚Äôs back to being a worthless option again.  Edit: Let me rephrase, I had 6 options that in total were worth about $400. Bid/Ask was roughly 1.60 if I remember correctly.|2019-07-09 08:35:00
