The risk currently is asymmetric: if CPI on 10/13 is hot, market won't go down much. If CPI is cooler than estimated, markets will jump.

Before that it was stocktwits (where I got perma banned) for several years. So many people on both sites couldn't last 2 quarters till they blew up.  It is worse on WSB because except for 18 there was never really a bear market while on twits. Just dips. So most people blew up on volatile stocks like Tesla. On WSB people get blown up mostly on index fund options. That is truely a sad thing.  Two questions.   First, if your have a bearish lean did you really think that Friday EOD was a reasonable time go all in short dated puts?  Second, if your bullish did you really think yesterday eod was really a good time to go all in short dated calls?  If your a swing trader and you did either. Shame. You are the worst.
