mwrv1t|fxqidb|fxqidb|12|the Fed is now underwriting the liabilities of distressed private issuers with the full faith and public credit of the government  the fed has failed in their regulatory mandate and has basically become the accommodation rubber stamp of the government who cannot maintain operations without increasing debt  why is this?  the government borrowers like municipalities and pension funds need to issue debt as part of their normal course of business, however they also need to hedge their duration and this is where the banks fuck them and make government borrowers their bitches  nevertheless these banks need lower rates than they collect from government borrowers in order to be profitable, hence the inevitable crash into zero percent rates required to sustain the big sell side banks, lending to banks at zero percent should be considered a chapter 11 type event and come with administration by the fed until solvent again with intervention-free market rates  essentially every sell side firm needs to be put into administration and reorganized immediately as the existence of the unlimited liabilities they create threatens national security  the fed should be a peace officer in the banking system and not act like Pablo Escobar by insuring the loses of private bond issuers, if the fed had not accommodated unlimited fiscal deficits then this financial catastrophy would not have happened in the first place   https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/04/09/fed-fires-an-even-bigger-bazooka-expands-its-shopping-list-to-include-junk-bonds.html|2020-04-09 12:05:25

mx0pek|fxqidb|fxqidb|6|If you play USO at least google what it does.  USO does NOT track the oil price, it tracks futures and because of "contango" effect USO can screw you harder than you can imagine.  **USO: It Is Time To Avoid This Oil ETF**  >Put simply, USO's architecture is agnostic to what happens to the shape of the forward curve and that ultimately has proven detrimental to holders most of the time.  >The problem here is due to "roll yield". Put simply, futures prices tend to converge towards the spot price of a commodity. This means that if a market is in contango (back-month contracts higher than spot), you'll see the back-month futures trade down in value towards the spot price in a typical month.  >In the case of WTI futures, the front two contracts have been in contango in about 80% of all months over the past decade.

I sold out and bought back at a 10% discount and rode this up about 10%.  I had windows up to go back to cash.  It's exactly one month since I did it the first time, but decided not to fight the Fed on Easter and will let them inject on Monday, but after that I think I'm doing big short.

So the fixed almost certainly goes to 0 while the inflation adjusted rates will be going up with all this money printing.

mwy5se|fxqidb|fxqidb|5| I think the best view to take is to be short term bull and long term bear. The unlimited QE/money printing from the american Fed is doing wonders propping up the current market, however all fundamentals are pointing towards a recession worse than 2008. It‚Äôs actually quite unnerving as all fundamentals are currently being thrown out the window with this recent rally in stock prices, when every other piece of news suggests that prices should be decreasing instead. If you can swing trade (or play options if you have the risk appetite), then I would suggest that at the current moment rather than investing for the long term. If the US opens up their economy at the end of April and the infection rates start rising again, there will undoubtedly be another crash. Not to mention, with 20% unemployment currently, the long-term economic effects of the virus are still yet to be felt. Because of this, I think staying mostly in cash is the smartest move until there is less uncertainty.|2020-04-09 12:58:14

mw20hf|fxqidb|fxqidb|10|I will say it again so we are all clear: We have to get to 279 before we can go down on the next leg. 278.73 is the 50% Fib retracement from the ATH to the low on 23 March so don't ask me where I got the number. We break 50%, we move down from there.  We just hit an absolute wall overnight and just now pre-market at 277. That is EXACTLY the 61.8% Fib retracement from the 4 March high to the 23 March low.  Call it all sorcery if you will, but algos are using this and that's where they are getting buy and sell signals. It is almost at 278 as I type. 279 is the key level to care about. I bet it gets above there and then moves down.  Holding a few puts that are a small percent of my portfolio (they are spreads not naked), almost all cash for full disclosure.|2020-04-09 08:07:41

Cuomo says  Earlier in the day, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that the city may need to tighten its social distancing restrictions to contain the coronavirus outbreak and prevent it from resurging, saying it‚Äôs going to be a ‚Äúlong, tough‚Äù April.¬†  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, restrictions may have to go up, meaning if things really get worse, we might have to tighten up further,‚Äù de Blasio said Thursday at a press conference. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what I envision today. It‚Äôs not what any of us want. But the truth is the truth.

I think the cascading loss of revenue from the retail crash and long-term slump in anything that involves a crowd is going to be a problem, no matter how many 3-4% loans the Fed gives.

Most of my portfolio is still long stonks, but this whole rally and news cycle smells like shit, and I just honestly cannot imagine the scenario that we recovery gracefully and hit new highs this year.

Things may change but based upon current info that was it. The top of the long credit cycle. Did you hear the Dolphins cry?|2020-04-09 15:40:12

mwdryb|fxqidb|fxqidb|4|So technical a analysis works like this. If stock XYZ breaks this price and goes up it will run up a lot higher. If it falls it‚Äôs consolidating, and if it falls a lot lower it lost support and will continue to slide. But if stock XYZ breaks that resistance price goes up it may also fall from heavy selling. So if it falls from heavy selling then it goes back to consolidating. If it keeps falling it loses support and the new price target is much lower. Now if starts falling but doesn‚Äôt reach its new lower price target, that‚Äôs because strong buying came in. Now the stock can make a new lower high. The whole things a fucking crap shoot. If the stock hits this target it will go higher until it doesn‚Äôt. The stock falls below this target then it will keep falling until it doesn‚Äôt. No one really fucking knows. Only thing that works is RSI.|2020-04-09 10:05:41

OPEC already agreed to a cut, they're just working out how much to cut now. We priced in 20M bpd; but rumor has it 10M bpd.     The market is oversupplied and storage is running out. 10M bpd is not enough of a production cut...they're gonna run out of storage if they don't cut more.  We are at 65M barrels in reserves and demand is only \~110M bpd ON A REGULAR DAY; COVID has essentially dropped that number 70%, so 10M bpd would hit storage capacity by the end of the month...and COVID is definitely not getting solved by the end of the month.|2020-04-09 10:25:17

mx4aoj|fxqidb|fxqidb|2|Holding GUSH calls and stock since the other day. Morning comes. GUSH opens around $27 and ramps up insane volatility from speculation of OPEC meeting. Twitter goes insane. GUSH get wilder. GUSH peaks a little over $29 at 10:30AM EST.  I say to myself "I've seen this movie before. I learned my lesson with INO and TVIX where I could have made 3x - 6x the money I made instead. No more premature ejaculation for me. Fuck the speculation, let's see that pump when OPEC puts out the real numbers. DIAMOND HANDS MOTHERFUCKER."  I hold. Price drops to about $26.50 in less than an hour. Back up to $27.50 two hours later. GUSH is less than $23 at time of this writing. Now waiting for EOD rebound to sell these calls as I don't want to get any closer to 4/17 expiry. But I'll hold the stock through to next week--that emergency G20 meeting tomorrow better come through. Hoping crude prices rise over time with production cuts. Hell, might be holding GUSH for a while...|2020-04-09 13:50:07

If this is true, the "filed for unemployment levels" don't reflect typical job loss, but rather an interruption in job practice...     EDIT: Thanks for teaching me about "furloughs".

I'm wondering if the banks are in a position to lose an insane amount of money due to whatever the fuck I have no idea about that would make the situation a million time worse if the stock markets tank. Like did they put too much money into equity/plays? Did the derivative market come back to bite them in the ass but this time it was ETFs and shit rather than MBS?   Anyone know if we can find out how exposed banks are to particular tickers/prices/dates?|2020-04-09 12:51:41

Bulls have since started their own 5 week bullish fractal, and it appears it will complete next week for turnover.  The real question is do bulls make it to 50% retrace during next week's candle, and if so, do they hold it for the duration of the candle.  I think we'll definitely test the old bottom at least once, even in the most absolutely bullish scenario we complete the fractal and then go up again.|2020-04-09 14:46:12

Europe is not going to recover like the US it will take at least 2 years. DB failure and major bankruptcies coming. Covid might begin again in the fall. Tourism will be down for at least a year.

No, it makes perfect sense. The market cares about liquidity, and there's more liquidity up due to all the dumb degenerate retards here who like to lose all their money like cucks thinking the market will give them free money because "mommy, unemployment figures are up!". Everyone already knew they were going up dumbass. Your shorts and puts just allow the market to hunt liquidity upwards.  I've sold all my calls that I posted as a thread many weeks ago and made 9X.

mw3mpz|fxqidb|fxqidb|-3|Well if SPY opens around this level that will be at the 50% retrace. Decent chance of going down after that, but could go for the 61.8% (\~293) which is right near the daily 50MA, would almost make sense to test that instead.|2020-04-09 08:26:04
