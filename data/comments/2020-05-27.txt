There’s a table rigged to always come up black! You’re gonna be rich!” You smile and nod.  As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. “You’re in luck buddy! There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.  You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.  “Red” you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.  You see the confused expression on Big Jay’s face as he spins the wheel. “Black” he calls with a sigh.  “This game is fucking rigged!” you shout as your puts expire worthless.|2020-05-27 10:47:21

rzfr0z|grh1fv|grh1fv|23|For all you fucking retards who are once again losing money on this dump,  Since the initial crash at the end of March, the chart pattern has been pretty fucking consistent. We rally hard for 10 days and then correct for two. We also tend to dump at the end of the month. With that being said:  1. Stop fomo’ing into calls after a 10%, week long rally. Stonks only go up but learn that they need to breathe and pullback every once in a while. Does your dick still get hard after pumping it 7 times in a row? No. Same with stonks  2. Stop fomo’ing into FD puts once everything is crashing. You’re already late. Stop chasing the god damn train and wait for the next one.   3. Hedge your shit.   4. Buy the fucking dip.   5. Learn some TA.  And yes I know patterns only become patterns after they form, but ride it until they stop working.   Also, I know most of you will probably scoff at this post and continue making the same dumb fucking plays, but frankly I don’t give a shit. Just know that there’s plenty of us with half a brain on the sidelines laughing at your dumbass saying “I told you so”.|2020-05-27 09:56:52

Saw Ford had gone up straight for pretty much the last week and bought some 5/29 way OTM FD puts.  Saw Disney has skyrocketed overnight, so put in a sell order this morning to sell my FD ford puts at a 50% loss. This was precisely at 9:35.  FOMOd back into my original Disney $140 6/26 call at a 25% higher premium than yesterday.  Immediately regretted that decision as I watched Disney plummet.  Figured a 5/29 FD General Motors $30c would be a nice addition to my collection on the way down.  Currently everything is dropping faster than my intelligence.|2020-05-27 09:00:10

Government gave all us peasants a 1200 dollar check after telling us we cant work, and borrowed trillions against our name, just to hand it to multi billionaires and corporations who underpay us and avoid taxes? Meanwhile us work slaves will miss mortgage and rent payments while the stock market hits all time highs because “our” tax payer money doesn’t belong to us. Nice.|2020-05-27 13:49:40

I feel like as we try to return to normal more business travel is going to shift to private and more people who flew first class for personal travel are going to pony up for fractional membership type things. Nobody wants to be locked on a tube with a bunch of mouth breathing poor folks while wearing full body condoms but everyone still needs to fly so I think the private jet market is going to..... take off.  Having trouble finding a way to profit from this. Seems like everything is private and the closest thing to a pure play is bombardier but with the overall drop in air travel demand I don't see a bunch of new planes being ordered.

One of the best marketing tactics Corvette did imo.

I go through phases where I can do no wrong and every trade I make is blessed, and I go through phases where every move I make gets reversed instantly, where it feels like the market responds to my moves. It seems so hard not to believe in the power of luck when you do this shit regularly.     Like, to demonstrate: I bought SPY 6/20 $290p today at SPY $298. I'm about to buy some SPY 6/20 $310c, but I know that as soon as I do I guarantee that we'll be rangebound between 290 and 310 for the next month. Like, I don't even need to place the trade to know that, because I know that I'm having a bad luck streak and I need to like sacrifice a chicken or something to lift the curse.|2020-05-27 12:02:00

South Korea reported 40 new cases on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise in nearly 50 days, as officials scrambled to trace hundreds of infections linked to nightspots, restaurants and a massive e-commerce warehouse near Seoul.|2020-05-27 06:44:04

Not sure how many more days like yesterday I could stomach before moving to cash gang.   Huge Canadian dollar rally also fucked my positions as I have a good chunk in USD. I like my positions... but the market is being hella retarded right now.   Can't believe DOW is over 25,000. We're barely down from the peak and heading into a full on depression.  Doesn't make sense that the markets can be this high with this gold price. Either the markets need to go lower, or gold higher... or I'm just an idiot who doesn't understand anything and I have no business investing money.|2020-05-27 08:58:31

I bought my 180c 5/29 for $5.20 last week during the dip, at about $7.00 now, considering selling and buying 1 or 2 puts as we have seen earnings leads to the stock going way down after a big run up if ER is positive.  Thoughts?  Also, should I sell my ULTA calls or hold through earnings? Also have a call credit spread up around the 265-275 level for 5/29, I wonder if magically I will be profitable on both or if they'll just cancel each other out?|2020-05-27 14:03:51

s0bt69|grh1fv|grh1fv|1|This entire game all comes down to consumer spending. Whether your company's end-consumer is an individual or another business, without a customer, you don't have shit.  With 25% of people unemployed and fairly widespread business failures over the coming months, there is going to be a significant reduction in consumers. As such, the only way that we can justify being at Feb 2020 valuations is if all the remaining consumers buy enough to make up for the ones who are no longer buying.  If 25% of people are unemployed, are the remaining 75% going to go on 33% more trips? Buy 33% more cars? Will they take on 33% more NFLX subscriptions, or increase their ACS usage by 33%?  It doesn't matter what your product is. If you lost 25% of your customers (B2B or B2C), and the remaining 75% don't pick up the slack, you're kind of fucked.  The current market is overvalued, and I am betting that within 3 months, we'll see that many of these job losses and business closures are permanent. At that time, the writing will be on the wall for even the most greed-blinded bull.|2020-05-27 14:16:02
