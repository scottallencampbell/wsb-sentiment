y81m9w|cw2vs7|cw2vs7|5|08:00 AM EDT, 08/27/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Anaplan (PLAN) reported a fiscal Q2 adjusted loss of $0.12 per diluted share, narrower than a loss of $0.18 per share a year ago and the $0.16 average loss estimate from analysts polled by Capital IQ. Shares were down more than 9% pre-market Tuesday.  Total revenue during the three months ended July 31 came in at $84.5 million, up from $57.8 million a year earlier and beating the $78.3 million consensus compiled by Yahoo Finance.  For Q3 of fiscal 2020, the company said revenue is expected to be $85.5 and $86.5 million, compared with a the analysts' estimate of $83.6 million.  Updating its previous forecast for the full year, the company said sales were now expected to be between $339 and $343 million, versus a previous estimate of between $326 and $331 million. The Street's full-year revenue estimate is $329.8 million.  Price: 53.96, Change: -5.38, Percent Change: -9.07  Where the negative news?  Lol|2019-08-27 07:24:42

y7xh0x|cw2vs7|cw2vs7|13|To all the autists getting their asses drilled on puts after tradetalksgoingwell.exe yesterday, please reference the daily charts. We've been in a trading range for over 3 weeks bouncing off the top and bottom with reckless abandon. On Friday we closed right at the bottom of that range which should have been a signal that it was 50/50 that we'd break out of that range or bounce back into it regardless of the news because the market does what it wants. Smart traders were taking profits and either hedging towards the high side for a bounce or pulling out alltogether at the very moment you were loading up on short positions. That's why you're here bitching with us instead of sucking titties in a tendie pool on your space yacht.|2019-08-27 06:18:35

This is another example of Trump saying one thing and the US doing something different, this would totally make sense if the rumors are true that Trump will make some kind of deal with Iran, they'll be allowed to sell but the oil they put on market will be well below their expectations and will be another element of the economic warfare the US is waging on Iran.|2019-08-27 15:16:09

y92h6u|cw2vs7|cw2vs7|4|**Regarding Costco:**  This seems just so fucking crazy, that it is pumping on this news.   [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/first-costco-in-china-shuts-down-early-on-opening-day-amid-crowds.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/first-costco-in-china-shuts-down-early-on-opening-day-amid-crowds.html)  Costco opened their first store in China today, and apparently the place was absolutely swarmed, to the point where there were lines wrapping around the block, they had to close the place early, and traffic in the surrounding area was brought to a standstill.  At least, this is what is happening according to the Chinese state media.  The government mouthpiece also said, *"SEE!?  This is why America's businesses need us!  Stop this trade war!"*  Okay listen, I agree that this trade war is a terrible idea on the part of Trump.  Everything about it sucks.  But something about this story...  It just seems so off to me.  Why the fuck would people wait in line for hours on end, to enter a fucking Costco.  If the store was so busy, why did they then close early?  It seems like a stunt put on by the Chinese government, as part of their campaign to influence American business in their favor (against Trump).  I know American business is already against Trump on this, but they could be even more against him.  Or maybe the retail industry is really just so weak in China, that their people are actually *that fucking excited* for a non-descript, soulless big-box store.  I don't know.  Show me some video of people actually leaving the store with carts full of items, and driving away.  Because that is conspicuously missing from anything I've seen.  China is absolutely on board with insane sounding PR stunts.  They have the kind of control over their people to make a stunt like this passable.|2019-08-27 14:22:40

If everyone just woke up and felt good and kept buying and borrowing, everything is fine -- low consumer confidence is really a contagion that self-actualizes further declines in confidence etc.  It's like sitting at a red light. The cars in the back can't accelerate instantaneously, because of propagated reaction time delay. If you slapped cooperative AI on all the cars, they could accelerate in unison and be perfectly efficient...  Wwhat if in the future AI controls consumer spending... perfectly optimizing production, consumption, and the distribution of resources for max utility... and "eradicating" recessions...   /bot OUT|2019-08-27 09:46:30

y8qadf|cw2vs7|cw2vs7|1|> BURRY LONG ON GAMESTOP: Tae Kim of Barron's reported last Thursday that Michael Burry, whose bet against subprime mortgages prior to the financial crisis was depicted in the book and film "The Big Short," is going long on GameStop (GME) shares. Burry told Kim that the retailer's "balance is actually in very good shape." "I believe they will have the cash flow to justify a much higher share price," he added. Kim added that earlier last week, Burry's firm Scion Asset Management disclosed that it had issued a letter to GameStop's board urging it to fully execute $237.6M remaining on its current $300M share repurchase authorization. The statement also said that the firm currently owns 3M shares of the retailer, or about 3% of shares outstanding.  that's new to me. GME only tapped in 20% of their share repurchase|2019-08-27 12:11:24
