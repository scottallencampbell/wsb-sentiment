ll552x|la0n4z|la0n4z|472|🚨 RED ALERT 🚨  Please google the word "silver" and look at the news. They are using the media to try and manipulate the price of silver to go up which hedgefunds apparently own large portions of in a desperate attempt to trick non-redditors into buying silver. They are saying we all are going in on silver and that it is "surging" even though it only just went up a mere 3 dollars since last week. Any profits they make from manipulating the price silver, they will use to try and cover their GME shorts. Please pass this info along to regular people, don't let them be fooled.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

llgipb|la0n4z|la0n4z|42|1. DON’T FALL FOR THE SILVER DECOY or any other distractions today  2. GME is the one with the most shorts (by a long-shot) and has the most potential by far... especially this week  3. AMC is second to GME and will pop this week as well.  3. ALL THE OTHERS have way less puts/shorts to squeeze and if/when they did squeeze is likely weeks out from now.   Don’t miss the GME and AMC rockets this week by buying into the others.   The whole squeeze frenzy could get shut down and time is critical.  Get on the rockets ready for take off NOW!   GME and AMC 💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀  🙏Copy/paste/share|2021-02-01 07:28:39

llxnys|la0n4z|la0n4z|50|(copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

lm6w9z|la0n4z|la0n4z|48|# PSA: In case some people don't actually know what’s going on here after blindly throwing their money at $AMC - The squeeze hasn’t occurred yet...that will occur once hedge funds give up and buy back their shares for higher prices, right now they are tying to manipulate this price to as low as possible to minimize their losses, and by selling you’re giving them exactly what they want. Buy and hold, eventually the hedge funds will give up, and that’s when the squeeze will occur.     Buy and hold $AMC 🚀🌙      8=====D\~\~|2021-02-01 10:29:01

By panicking and selling, you're contributing to the dip. Read the comments, hold/buy the dips, or don't, whatever you want. Gotta like the stock after all.  People in here have been holding GME through weeks worth of dips. Those that are new, quit worrying, and listen the advice in todays $GME discussion.

llyd3c|la0n4z|la0n4z|30| Repost:  LITERALLY NO VOLUME LMAO YOU BOYS REALLY HAVE 💎✋🏻  look on webull if you cant find volume  ps thats good news for anyone that doesnt understand anything  no panic needed, last week they dropped the price from 400 to 100 and it came right back, stay true to your convictions and know the math  its called a short ladder attack. Hedge funds are selling the gme stocks they already between each other at low prices rapidly to pull down the market. They can only do this so much before that would also make them run out of money. They are on the ropes, desperate, they dont want to lose their million dollar wives lol  not financial advice and also i keep reposting this so as many ppl see can so these newer people understand they are trying to scare you but MATH IS MATH|2021-02-01 09:35:44

llylh6|la0n4z|la0n4z|30|Volume is high, they know that if they allow another stock to play out like GME that they will never have control back. Dont let them scare you off. These folks have everything to loose by not doing everything in their power to stop us. Why would there be a such a low limit of shares alowed to buy for AMC on Robinhood? Why SLV news in premarket? If it was a true crash they would let you buy into a sinking ship. DO NOT BE FOOLED!!! Just watch a ticker of the buys...we are buying the dips, they are just selling their entire brokerage house to hide it.|2021-02-01 09:37:05

lm0nh5|la0n4z|la0n4z|32| (copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

llmm4g|la0n4z|la0n4z|28|I've been following the Gamestop trend on here for the past couple of weeks and, much like other people, have started to notice a lot of strange posts about silver.  Digging into some of the account histories of those promoting silver, we find some interesting things:  [This link](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ieae/i_went_full_retard_and_bought_15_kilograms_of/) - a 3 year old account with 1 month of posting history, oldest visible post on a trading subreddit.  [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/gkzfeb3/) - an account which just started posting regularly 4 days ago and posted a hilariously easy to photoshop image as "proof" of holdings (with 17 awards).  [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72m7j/when_should_we_go_all_in_on_silver/) - 10 month old account which mainly posted about MMA until 3 days ago, since then only posts have been about silver.  [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l70j2t/punish_the_banks_punish_the_hedges_buy_the_one/) - year old account with sporadic posting history....until 3 days ago when they started posting about silver.  [This - one of the most obviously astroturfed posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/) - a 9 month old account with two posts 8 months ago and every post since then (in the last 4 days) about silver.  Realistically, it would probably cost around $1500 to give that many awards to that post. $1500 is pocket change to firms like Citron which hold a big stake in silver.  [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l723fs/guys_now_is_the_time_for_silver_it_is_currently/) - posted 3 days ago (noticing a pattern?) - 3 year old account, just became active again after about a year.  The list goes on from that obviously.  A good chunk of those accounts appear to be purchased accounts. The tell-tale sign is a huge gap in post history and way off topic posting. Anyone with a couple thousand dollars lying around could do it. For huge firms which already held millions of dollars in silver/silver securities, it's like pissing into the ocean.   I just want everyone to be aware of what's happening.|2021-02-01 08:20:26

lltvx6|la0n4z|la0n4z|28|NASDAQ publishes a report on short positions twice af month. According to sources who has acces to this report, the hedgefond holding AMC shorts (15. january estimated 41%, others on reddit have said 62%, and maybe even more at this time), a unknown percentage of their short was set at 9$, which is why it was important to close above that last friday. This short is said to run out today - meaning they will have to pay 0.25% of each stocks price each day onwards in rent. A lot when AMC currently is at 15-17 dollars a stock, and they are holding 52 million of them (estimated 27. january). Furthermore 37% of the floating stocks (floating means available for trading and therefore shorting), is owned by institutions who doens't sell their position to the hedges. If we put these numbers together: 100%-37% = 63% left for the shorters to buy back. And they need to buy back between 41-62%, making it almost a 100% effectively at best. Which means that we, the retail investors, effectively have the power to drive the price up potential 40-100$ (some say more, personally im skeptical). Along the week, more of their short positions will run out, making it for an even more expensive short, and then the big squeeze will begin. Maybe late-week, maybe next week.|2021-02-01 09:09:03

llmatd|la0n4z|la0n4z|22|Guys, i got in this one way late. After a couple years on wsb, i found my priorities weren’t right; and deleted both my reddit account and robinhood. I got a new one, and my bank account and i have avoided this place like the plague.  This sort of crowdsourced robinhood investing is incredible. I’m so proud of all you entertaining assholes, and I’ve missed the hell out of you.  I bought a single share, as it’s all robinhood would let me go in on. (And fuck those guys for trying to help the hedges leverage in as you sell above the threshold. )  I’m gonna hold this thing until 2000.  I’m then gonna sell, and give earnings less taxes to my local starbucks in the form of a tip. Those baristas have been dealing with my slowly degrading social skills in the drive thru over the last year. When they had no idea whether this pandemic would kill them or not? They served me fucking coffee anyway.  You all deserve this win. They all deserve this cash.  Will provide proof.  I like the stock.  Godspeed you glorious fucks!|2021-02-01 08:18:01

lm07ww|la0n4z|la0n4z|22|WSB (everyone) is going against experienced traders. The top 1% have patience and deep pockets.  They are also coordinating together the same way WSB is coordinating. They also have bots in these groups so remember that   If WSB (everyone) doesn’t stick together and coordinate, then top 1% will manipulate the stock price by buying or selling options or stock and win off of your fear. It’s as simple as that. They aren’t going to just give up and hand you money  So buy and hold. Go do something else and come back on Friday and get an update on what everyone is doing. That might be the best if you don’t have the gut to buy and hold for now  Edit: we aren’t coordinating we just like the stock. And if you like anything is possible❤️🚀🌕|2021-02-01 09:46:57

llfblr|la0n4z|la0n4z|47|1. DON’T FALL FOR THE SILVER DECOY or any other distractions today  2. GME is the one with the most shorts (by a long-shot) and has the most potential by far... especially this week  3. AMC is second to GME and will pop this week as well.  3. ALL THE OTHERS have way less puts/shorts to squeeze and if/when they did squeeze is likely weeks out from now.   Don’t miss the GME and AMC rockets this week by buying into the others.   The whole squeeze frenzy could get shut down and time is critical.  Get on the rockets ready for take off NOW!   GME and AMC 💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀  🙏Copy/paste/share|2021-02-01 07:17:01

llxr1v|la0n4z|la0n4z|44|(copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

llgy9w|la0n4z|la0n4z|156|This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.     KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)     1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the "cause" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.     PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.     2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying "lets get this to $30" or "let get this to 100". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.     3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)     4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)     Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.     \- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.     5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.     6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.     7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.     8. What is short selling: >> [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)     9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)     10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.     11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.     12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.     I hope this helps many.|2021-02-01 07:32:41

[HERE IS A DIRECT LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvVhAhpYbio)  Even that video is being brigaded. Accounts with literally zero comments over years are claiming they are "long time watchers and are leaving". It's crazy - these people are new accounts, or people who never watched before.   The world is going insane right now with all these bots and massive multimedia army that was raised to fight this. I knew they'd fight back, but wow this is nuts!  I've tried to post similar threads all over the place, and even when I don't link videos it gets banned and blocked, or instantly downvoted to -500 in seconds!!  We need to get the word out and fight this complete BS. Its insane how the rich have no problem straight up lying and manipulating the market.

llynl0|la0n4z|la0n4z|46|(copied and pasted for support)  🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫  It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades)  But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up  But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds)  Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed  Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

Look what they did to us, look how they stripped us of our rights to trade. Get off robinhood and lets destroy the shorts and these funds and take away all their money. Lets make a statement that they will regret restricting us. We arent done. AMC to the moon this week, gme still has a push but gme should start cooling down and slowly easing money into AMC. Next week we have another new ticker for everyone. Everyone needs to stick together. New week new ticker.....#amcmoontime|2021-02-01 07:52:43

llyc0v|la0n4z|la0n4z|17| (copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

They are about to lose many many billions you morons. It’s going to sky rocket and they are artificially lowering the price so idiots on here go “ah I guess everything I learned about shorting isn’t true guess I’ll sell and lose a ton of money.

GME is the one with the most shorts (by a long-shot) and has the most potential by far... especially this week  3. AMC is second to GME and will pop this week as well.  3. ALL THE OTHERS have way less puts/shorts to squeeze and if/when they did squeeze is likely weeks out from now.   Don’t miss the GME and AMC rockets this week by buying into the others.   The whole squeeze frenzy could get shut down and time is critical.  Get on the rockets ready for take off NOW!   GME and AMC 💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀  🙏Copy/paste/share|2021-02-01 07:15:00

llvzqt|la0n4z|la0n4z|18|CNBC still pushing silver hard, and tying it to "redditors" since they can't tie it to wsb.  Or, when they don't out and out lie like that, they run a stock price and graph of GME on more than 1/2 the screen while talking about silver, clearly tying it in an indirect way to wsb.  What a fucking joke.  Just look at the posts on the main page.  History of the market proves that silver is one of the most manipulated commodities on the market (just do a search for Hunt brothers + silver), and you can see this manipulation playing out live on cable tv.  SEC?  nowhere to be seen.|2021-02-01 09:22:06

All it takes is some hedge fund covering or some big money buy at some support to rally again. So if you bought, just hold.

Don’t miss the GME and AMC rockets this week by buying into the others.   The whole squeeze frenzy could get shut down and time is critical.  Get on the rockets ready for take off NOW!

Hedge funds are selling the gme stocks they already between each other at low prices rapidly to pull down the market. They can only do this so much before that would also make them run out of money. They are on the ropes, desperate, they dont want to lose their million dollar wives lol  not financial advice and also i keep reposting this so as many ppl see can so these newer people understand they are trying to scare you but MATH IS MATH|2021-02-01 09:32:54

Go jerk off or fucking run a mile or whatever the hell makes you focus. Stay focused. Do we want to lose now? I mean, stay focused. GME is where it's at right now. You have some AMC, hold it. But, if you start selling your GME right now, no AMC will ever be able to make up the losses for you (those who are in the red) or the huge potential upside.  Do you see AMC going up 1000%? It ain't going to happen. AMC is a nice stock to have to  hold for after COVID. But the game is in GME right now.|2021-02-01 09:46:09

Basically manipulating the market. My suggestion would be to find another service. I cancelled my application and switched to SoFi simply because they are not limiting my trades and not slowing down the application process. Applied and allows me to set up trades already. Use what you can but avoid Robinhood. Hope this is helpful and remember hold with diamond hands|2021-02-01 06:35:47

What freaking millennial is going to say, "silver, now there's a good investment?" The only people who do that are the same ones who crack open Monster energy drinks and think they "still got it" if a girl even looks in their direction.

GME is the one with the most shorts (by a long-shot) and has the most potential by far... especially this week  3. AMC is second to GME and will pop this week as well.  3. ALL THE OTHERS have way less shorts to squeeze and if/when they did squeeze is likely weeks out from now.   Don’t miss the GME and AMC rockets this week by buying into the others.   The whole squeeze frenzy could get shut down and time is critical.  Get on the rockets ready for take off NOW!   GME and AMC 💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀  🙏Copy/paste/share|2021-02-01 07:04:44

llvz82|la0n4z|la0n4z|26|Literally no reason to sell GME, it is impossible for the shorts to have covered already when over 100% were shorted. The only reason to sell is FUD.  Nothing changes if retail investors sell. Hedge funds won't change, and everyone will hate themselves when it's discovered that Melvin Capital made more money this year than ever before.  Don't fuck it up with paper hands.  I know nothing, I just like the stock and think GME is undervalued.|2021-02-01 09:22:00

llyrxq|la0n4z|la0n4z|28| (copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

GME is the one with the most shorts (by a long-shot) and has the most potential by far... especially this week  3. AMC is second to GME and will pop this week as well.  3. ALL THE OTHERS have way less puts/shorts to squeeze and if/when they did squeeze is likely weeks out from now.   Don’t miss the GME and AMC rockets this week by buying into the others.   The whole squeeze frenzy could get shut down and time is critical.  Get on the rockets ready for take off NOW!   GME and AMC 💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀🌙💰💎👏🚀  🙏Copy/paste/share|2021-02-01 07:01:17

lm6woo|la0n4z|la0n4z|12|This reminds me when we were kids, and some adult figure would count to 3 to get us to stop what we were doing or face their wrath. We'd do exactly that just not to see what would happen if we didn't.  As we grew older, this practice seemed more like empty threats than anything so we'd push the boundaries to see what might happen. Maybe a spanking or two, but nothing that will kill us.  Until it came to the point where we did whatever the fuck we wanted to cause nothing is going to stop us from getting what we wanted and deserved.  It's the same thing here my fellow autists. These dumps are empty threats. Attempts to scare us into thinking about the worst things that could happen.  But it shan't stop us. We've come this far, their threats are all but empty. We love these stocks. Don't give in. HOLD! TO THE FUCKING MOON MY RETARD BROTHERS AND SISTERS! HOLD HOLD HOLD! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-01 10:29:05

lly2ha|la0n4z|la0n4z|41| (copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

lliow6|la0n4z|la0n4z|59|AMC current status (30JAN2021) :  AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)   Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.   Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)  So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.   But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday   &#x200B;  Recommendation:   1. HOLD  2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise  3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.  &#x200B;  This is not my analysis or a recommendation|2021-02-01 07:48:14
llx3ir|la0n4z|la0n4z|51|*EDIT* RELATING TO AMC  1.  Patience !!  Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away.  If you do - this whole plan falls apart.  Do not be tempted by small profits.  You need to hold and not sell.  We also have to keep buying.  For those here mostly for the "cause" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.  2.  Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100.  If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher.  Please, everyone, stop saying "lets get this to $30" or "let get this to 100".  This has so much more potential than those low numbers.  Patience, and hold.    3.  How does a short squeeze work:  Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY   4.  What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling?  This video will show you:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc         Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.  - They will manipulate the market to drop the price.  DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy.  DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.    5.  Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price.  Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period.  However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up.  The price, technically speaking, is infinite.    6.  Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account.  Just open another broker account and buy through there:  Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying.  If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.  7.  Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing.  You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.  8.  What is short selling:  >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp    9.  Short selling does not expire.  Options do expire.  Familiarize yourself with the difference.  Link here:  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp    10.  Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this.  With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.    11.  Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares.  Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading.  Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m).  Please understand the difference.  12.  Again.  I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both.  To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up.  HOLD.  Buy, and HOLD.  Do not sell for small profits.|2021-02-01 09:28:37

llcxxl|la0n4z|la0n4z|20|Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns . It's already starting.  The number of posts with supposed "level headed" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to "rethink your strategy" but still "Go GME!! I am one of you guys!", always with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.  Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.  Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALL THE OTHERS have way less puts/shorts to squeeze and if/when they did squeeze is likely weeks out from now.   Don’t miss the GME and AMC rockets this week by buying into the others.

They would not have partnerships with Amazon, Sony, baidu and more with out those companies having major trust in what they can offer them. Hold strong and weather the bullshit RH storm.

They have a firm handle on their short positions and will will out some profit in their physical silver as well, but in the long run THIS IS A DISTRACTION!   Any savvy autists following Silver have been waiting on this squeeze for YEARS! Myself included. It’s not gonna happen.

llxzy7|la0n4z|la0n4z|27|(copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

ll9s43|la0n4z|la0n4z|51|🚨 RED ALERT 🚨  Just Google the word "silver" and look at the news. They are using the media to try and manipulate the price of silver to go up which hedge funds apparently own large portions of in a desperate attempt to trick non-redditors into buying silver. They are saying we all are going in on silver and that it is "surging" even though it only just went up 3 dollars since last week. Any profits they make from manipulating the price silver, they will use to try and cover their GME shorts. Please pass this info along.

The hope and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the Hedge fund war machine, the elimination of Melvin tyranny over the oppressed peoples of the world, and security for ourselves in a free world.  Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is will trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.  But this is the year 2021! Much has happened since the Hedge fund triumphs of 2020. The Apes have inflicted upon citadel great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our investing offensive has seriously reduced their strength. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to Victory!  I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory! To the moon.  Good luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.|2021-02-01 06:46:43

I love you all. This place is so hilarious and full of heart.

llwcaz|la0n4z|la0n4z|9|I am just speculating, but watching the volume being traded for GME, BB, and AMC is when there is a sudden drop, lets say 1-3%, you see volume jump notably. When volume returns to normalcy within today's average, it slowly goes back up. There is likely a lot of day traders involved now since the volatility benefits them whether they are doing a quick short-sell, or a quick buy and sell, etc. Don't panic during quick fluctuations.|2021-02-01 09:24:11

llwzag|la0n4z|la0n4z|9|If we’re being honest, I got in earlier to make profit, got a few measly bucks to break a little over even, then i went back to the drawing board over the weekend.  Honestly after reading all the comments and seeing the posts of people giving back. I’m in it for the people, for the movement, for the countless amount of people that have been screwed over by the rich people making a buck off of them.  I love the stocks.  I’ll say it louder for the ones in the back.. I LOVE THE STOCKS. I’ve always found solace in video games and going to the movies. If I were to put my money anywhere it’s here. Two things that despite not having tons of money, finding my self scrounging around for changing in my car to eat food, have allowed me to get away from that reality even for a moment. Live has been good to me, my wife is amazing, and I’m in a place where I don’t care about the money.  It’s about sending a message. It’s letting those freebies know, we’ve had enough. I’m holding for those who can’t invest, I’m holding for those who cant make ends meet. I’m holding for those who don’t know where their next meal is coming from.  If I bottom out, I know I did my part as best I could to make those hedge funds feel the pain of all the people they screwed over.  💎🙌🏼|2021-02-01 09:27:57

llxxn3|la0n4z|la0n4z|8|Worthy tards, I just opened up a webull account in order to transfer my RH (I know I know, I got into trading a little over a year ago and RH was by far the easiest to get into. Obviously that changed)over to a better provider. I just wanted to know if I should wait on my options to go through (expiring in a few weeks) before transferring everything to webull or just transfer everything and have my contracts sit in RH until things go through. My portfolio isn’t just GME and AMC. I have a lot more I’ve invested over time. I’m just hesitant rn since I want to put more into the GME AMC and BB assault but I’ve capped out on RH. Also I forgot to mention I am full on retarded|2021-02-01 09:33:18

I can't contain how they're trying to convince you into their narrative in the daily thread and bullshit posts now.  If you think *boomers can't into internet*, you're dead wrong. They mastered spreading misinformation before you were even born, they know perfectly what to do. They manipulate elections and your opinion, whenever they want. Misinformation became one of the most lucrative "dark" businesses in the last few years. Shaping public's opinion isn't cheap, and expensive as fuck, but definitely worth it for them. Especially when there are **BILLIONS** in the game.  **Here are terms that you need to know,** and it's not only for WSB. It's for your fucking well-being. Please you illiterates spend some time and read a thing once. This is how our world looks now.

Decided to look into him more and found out he’s from Massachusetts. I’m also from here and thought wow that’s crazy. Then I read a bit more and saw that he’s from a place called Wilmington Ma , that’s literally 5 min up the street from me.

First they tried to prevent us from buying. Now they’re trying to push SLV. coincidence? I think not. Use your smooth brains and figure it out. Just a couple of days ago everyone was calling out the media for spreading so much misinformation and bias now all of a sudden they are the spreader of absolute fact and truth? 😂 Most people on here are smart but just wanted to say this for the few.

You can't get rid of it and it will get triggered by these ladder attacks, so on that basis it is better off not buying new shares at all.  Brightside is this doesn't apply to shares bought before today.  Hold the old. Dont waste your time buying new on etoro, do it on another platform.|2021-02-01 10:09:18

Create hope, allow a modest rise, then crush.      The older WSBers will remember SLV Gang.      I‘ve got lots of physical silver as a back up. Will do GREAT if price soars.

llz49y|la0n4z|la0n4z|26| (copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

But I found you all funny so I kept reading the Yolo threads and such.   Fast forward to January 2021, no events, no parties, no seeing friends still. So I decide to fight my boredom and read up on some wallstreetbets (I've spent so much time in my room in the last 12 months that I've literally turned into a full-blown basement tard.).   What do I see...? Tards saying "GME to the moon, $150 is not a même, shit like that". I'm thinking... Still no common sense.   Few days and weeks roll by and a realise these bunch of diamond handed apes are giving it hard up the anal cavity of these shorting bastard hedge funds who are trying to put an end to my favourite video game store as a child (I am a certified melenial).  It's then that I realised that common sense is the only path to commonality amongst men. So I bought GME at $360.  I am with you till the end my friends, thank you for invigorating that lost passion in my life.

llzugx|la0n4z|la0n4z|18| (copied and pasted for support) PLEASE SHARE THIS!!! 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down alot🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫 It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

WSB has been my favourite sub all year, honestly not even for the DDs and investing ideas, but because its fucking hilarious.

lm73ce|la0n4z|la0n4z|36|I have a question about my situation for anyone with some financial background. Will provide some details; just looking for some very general basic advice as I'm new to this.  - Your opinion is just that, opinion. I will not take it as financial advice or hold you liable. My retarded decisions are my own -   I had $100 to my name like 14 months ago. I invested and sold/resold the same couple stocks for a bit then invested everything I had in Air Canada at $11ish; sold at $20ish and nearly doubled my money. I used some to pay all my debt and some expenses and whatnot; but invested about 10k shares at $1.07 into a company called the Very Good Food Company; when is now at at like $8. $100 to $80k in about a year.  I genuinely think this stock will go to $15+, possibly soon (not at all suggesting people buy; I'm no expert or analyst just my opinion) so I'm very hesitant to sell.  I have 10 GME @ 256, and 50AMC@14.50; holding til the end on those. Should I risk what I think is a stable investment that's already up like 800%? I also have another $2500 cash to invest; GME or AMC?|2021-02-01 10:30:16

In a post on its website Sunday, the popular online brokerage said it  narrowed the list of limited stocks down to eight. But there were still some  limits to trading.

lluct3|la0n4z|la0n4z|12|Just added more AMC and more NOK 💎🙌 on GME  I really like NOK it's been upgraded to buy, and they have an earnings report coming later in the week. Not to mention their various 5G contracts both here in the US but also internationally.. it's definitely a longer play meaning weeks to months compared to GME. But even GME sideways traded for a while before all this drama.   Get in on NOK now or if your focus is GME rn (as is mine) when those gains roll in and you're looking for another investment NOK is worth a look.

lm3aet|la0n4z|la0n4z|12|(Serious and holding 216 GME shares)  I've been reading obout [counterfeiting stock](https://counterfeitingstock.com) and starting to be a bit worried. I don't mind dips, I don't mind red days and seing the bots and disinformation campaigns makes me happy.  Smaller brokers and hedge funds may get caught in a squeeze, be forced to cover and all that fun infinity stuff. But prime brokers and market makers? What exactly stops them from simply counterfeiting more shares to crash the stock and dilute shares? There are more than enough ways to legally create counterfeit shares and keep them circulating indefinitely.  And from what I've read the SEC can't do much about that as for now.   I'm still holding, despite seing my portfolio going down from $100k+ to about $40k. Why would I sell at a discount?   But honestly some wrinklybrain explaining to me why they cannot do that would help reinforce these diamond hands.|2021-02-01 10:05:57

ll4jdy|la0n4z|la0n4z|5|The only action taken by brokers that could possibly be construed as protecting individual investors was raising margin requirements to 100%. After that all trades are cash backed and will eventual settle so the DTC raising collateral from 6% to 100% was a bullshit move intended to slow down trading to protect the institutions with shares lent out to shorts  These moves limiting trading aren't so much to help the smaller hedge funds with underwater shorts. They are trying to drive price down because if the shorts end up insolvent they will be unable to by back and return shares. Many of these shares have been loaned out by brokers like Robinhood. In fact I would love to know how many GME shares Robinhood has lent out to institutional shorts. I know IBKR loaned a ton of GME shares and that is why their CEO is talking about "protecting the markets"  This is about the lenders not getting their shares back and taking a fucking huge loss|2021-02-01 05:07:23

llxk0v|la0n4z|la0n4z|7|A POEM FOR US:  When a team works together, you know what they'll do.  They put strength together and they shoot for the moon.   And if the moon is to close for that group to explore, They stay strong together while reaching for more.   They travel together while blasting past Mars,  Moving as one while reaching for stars.   Soon Jupiter, Saturn are memories past, While the ship that they built continues to last.   And The journey's not done, it's not even close, They flew past Uranus, traveling further than most.   Neptune was next, and was easily taken,  Diamond hands in control, no CONFIDENCE shaken.   The groups only mission was to change what they saw,  A system thats filled with infinite flaws  But together they stood, each hand in hand Bringing new light to problems, facing the land  And In changing the world, it didn't take much Just billions of miles and new Heroes to us!!|2021-02-01 09:31:10

llw1of|la0n4z|la0n4z|20|Noobs, as a noob myself, I too had paper hands last week. I panicked and it cost me compared to if I just held. There’s no doubt about it, seeing dips and an immediate short term loss can be shocking at first, panic inducing. It made me feel sick to my stomach, even when I was sure I was fine with the amount I risked. I guess I simply wasn’t prepared for this roller coaster.   I took a step back, accepted the consequences of 2nd guessing myself, hesitating, backpedaling, and re-entered the market at a smaller amount that I knew I’d have fun just checking the ups and downs, like a real roller coaster.   Don’t put yourself in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable, nervous, or sick. In the end, this is a new experience, unknown, so adjust as needed so you can enjoy the ride.

Look what they did to us, look how they stripped us of our rights to trade. Get off robinhood and lets destroy the shorts and these funds and take away all their money. Lets make a statement that they will regret restricting us. We arent done. AMC to the moon this week, gme still has a push but gme should start cooling down and slowly easing money into AMC. Next week we have another new ticker for everyone. Everyone needs to stick together. New week new ticker...#amcmoontime|2021-02-01 07:41:01

llahev|la0n4z|la0n4z|14|Hey Hedge Fund Intern Spies,  If your firm wrote any uncovered GME calls that expired in the $ on Friday, your firm must purchase stocks on the market and deliver to the apes by Tuesday. I would sell my stocks at the market price Tuesday at open (even though your magic HFT algos have proven to highly manipulate the market price on Thursday), if three conditions are met:   * Publicly apologize to the employees of Gamestop for shorting their company. * Publish your Loss Porn * Have your hedge fund manager reach out to our mods and submit to an AMA on this subreddit tonight.  Otherwise I'll hold my stock and one day gift it to my grandchildren. Not a financial advisor or anything, I just like the stock.|2021-02-01 06:24:31

It seems like the hedgers are trying to lure everyone into a much more massive market to try and squash us like bugs... From what I've been reading, they probs already own a massive amount of silver after all so a silver "squeeze" would only make them much stronger. I think it'd make sense if we stuck to GME till the squeeze is squoze but I just a fool monkey. This no financial advise.   Thoughts?|2021-02-01 07:41:58

Then once the 9th inning rolls around, we’ll fucking strike 2 of your guys out, 2 guys will probably get on base, one of those will literally steal a base because your team is crooked af and will try anything at this point.

llgxum|la0n4z|la0n4z|10|I think the Government (SEC) should just let this short squeeze play out...  1. Markets that regulate themselves are better than markets than need regulation enforced by government. You should be able to short sell MORE shares than are actually available. If you do, you are making a big risk that the retarded peasants might notice and organize themselves to make you pay. That is how risk works. 2. The government stands to earn $BILLIONS$ in capital gains tax. Just think of it – the only way for hedge funds to lose $billions$ is for retail investors to gain $bilions$. And the only way for retail investors to gain $billions$ is to sell their stocks – thus incurring 30% capital gains tax. Yummmy – the government LOVES tax money!! 3. Don’t worry about broke hedge fund managers! With all the new tax money the government is getting – they can easily afford to issue $600 stimulus checks to all the poor hedge fund managers! It was soooo helpful to the current peasants – I’m sure it will be equally as helpful to hedged funders!|2021-02-01 07:32:35

llj6r9|la0n4z|la0n4z|5|Credit to: u/jbambino18. He quoted someone idk who.  PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS  To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:  AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)  Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.  Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)  So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.  But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.  Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday  My recommendation: 1. HOLD 2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise 3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.|2021-02-01 07:52:29

llpxiz|la0n4z|la0n4z|4| Already I'm seeing posts about how "Robinhood won't let me do this or that" as the market opened this morning. You had all weekend to prepare, transfer what you own to a different brokerage, and trade stress-free. Robinhood is OLD NEWS. Robinhood is the abusive ex you keep going back to because of all the good memories. Nobody should be giving a fuck about them anymore because we know they're corrupt and out to wreck your financial prospects. So stop complaining, act in the moment and switch to a different brokerage, and for the love of god make smart decisions. This is not financial advice, I just like this stock.  🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-01 08:43:58

I'm seeing alot of comments still about its lack of buying and usability still. YOU SHOULD BE TRANSFERRING ALL YOUR ASSESTS TO FIDELITY OR ANOTHER BROKERAGE THAT IS NOT LIMITING YOU! Be aware that RH does charge 75$ for the transfer (no big deal seeing as my 💎🙌 will take my tendies to the edge of the MILKY WAY) and it does take some time to complete.  Don't let RH throttle our momentum due to limiting our trading capabilities! MAKE THE SWITCH AND GET YOUR TENDIES INTO OVERDRIVE!! 🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-01 09:30:18

Get off robinhood and lets destroy the shorts and these funds and take away all their money. Lets make a statement that they will regret restricting us. We arent done.

I have friends who are designers and I recently got a beautiful deck of tarot cards. While I don't believe in that at all, I am dumb, so I shuffled up and laid out 3 cards in a traditional manner.  [https://imgur.com/a/JzziS6w](https://imgur.com/a/JzziS6w)  I asked the question of the universe, "What will happen with our GameStop stock?" and the results are intriguing, to say the least. I think that the spirit world has our back.  * The Fool represent living in the moment, freedom from fear and divine madness. * The Knight of Hearts represents a quest of the heart and fighting for a noble cause. * The King of Spades is a warrior who leads the armies and deals blows with sharp and swift efficiency.  So, clearly, an army of apes is destined to go to the moon.  🦍 🙌💎🚀🚀🚀  This is not financial advice, I am a retard, and barely own any GME.|2021-02-01 08:27:46

llq5g4|la0n4z|la0n4z|9| I have not sold my GME. I do not plan to. The silver boom that is being played off as coming from this sub is stupid. HOWEVER, when this fake silver short squeeze crashes, I believe silver WILL BE a good buy.  The coming crash will cause it to be relatively cheap where it was already a week ago. Silver mines aren't really being opened after the crash in 2011, and it is still widely used in electronics, so the supply is not meeting demand in the near future. The Biden administration, whether because of bad monetary policy or because of the possibility of a Green New Deal, will not reverse this trend. If you can stomach the volatility, pick some up when this all comes down.|2021-02-01 08:45:25

llr3f6|la0n4z|la0n4z|12| Guys, right now, the brokerage houses that suspended trading are running around explaining that it was capital requirements with the clearing houses that caused them to suspend trading.  They act like that explanation somehow exhonerates them.  But the reality is, they didn't HAVE to do this. They WANTED to. They could have gone out and gotten more capital. (Like Robinhood did a weak job of the next day.) Or they could have reallocated their existing capital to cover these trades.  Robinhood had a choice. Go get more capital or suspend trading. They chose to suspend trading. Since they're pre-IPO, almost anybody providing capital will want a lot of interest or equity. So, basically: bad for Robinhood people with an ownership stake.  So, don't accept their explanation. It's true, but it amounts to:  "I could have stopped that gorilla from raping your sister. But I might have gotten my shoes dirty. Since I didn't want to get my shoes dirty, you can't blame me that your sister was raped."  THEY HAD A CHOICE. They knew their actions would hurt longs and help shorts. They made their choice knowing they were going to hurt their own customers. They did it anyway, because that is what was best for THEM.  If you think the game is rigged, it is. Just maybe not the way it seems on the surface. But the game is rigged so that if YOU can make a buck or THEY can make a buck, THEY will and they don't care about you at all.  Be careful this week, guys. Gamestop is the Alamo. You guys are heroes. But think of what a mountain of money can do for you and for society if it's in the hands of good people instead of these abject moral sewerholes on Wall Street. It's no fun being a bagholder. You kicked the \*\*\*\* out of some hedge fund traders. But there are other ones out there ready to take your money if you want to be the last guys defending the Alamo.  The brokerages, including Robin Hood, threw a lifeline to the shorts. They saved the shorts and f\*\*\*ed you in the process. If you're still trading the short squeeze, make sure you're looking at the current short position. After the brokerages saved the shorts, that squeeze lost a lot of its squeezing power.  Cheers! You guys are heroes. The entire country is rooting for you. But don't forget how the Alamo ended. Either way, you'll be legends when this is over.|2021-02-01 08:51:41

I posted it in Friday's thread, but tried to rerecord it a little better and I doubt many of you saw if because it was Saturday by then.  Thanks for any help or input! I can keep rewriting it.

lle3z8|la0n4z|la0n4z|17|Somebody help this dumb noob understand the taxes portion of all this. Say you invest 3k and when you sell you sold at 10k. That’s a profit of 7k. How does the taxes come into play? You owe as soon as you sell them for a gain or you owe once you transfer the money off the app into your bank account ? Also if you owe taxes on that 7k what happens if you don’t pull it out and you keep it on Robin Hood and reinvest all of it and end up losing it - are you still responsible for paying taxes on that 7k that u lost and never pulled out ? If you are responsible do most ppl pull out a certain amount to cover for taxes owed on the 7k profit and then only reinvest the difference ?|2021-02-01 07:04:31

lll7wo|la0n4z|la0n4z|15|Finances are not my strong suit. I took out a 401k loan to buy my car. I started using Robinhood last year to “diversify my portfolio”. I keep making mistakes because I don’t know what I’m doing which only amplifies my insecurity/anxiety. After what you all have done, I want to sell everything and pull out of Robinhood. However, I’ve been told it’s not good to be emotional or reactionary with money.   * Do I try to buy GME stock now OR do I wait? (I can only afford one share) * Do I stay with Robinhood and hold the shares I have OR do I mic drop out of there? * What is a better alternative to buy stock on for novice people like me?   I am single, live alone, living paycheck to paycheck with more debt than savings. I don’t have thousands of dollars to invest. I can only afford up to $1,000 to invest. All I want is to turn that money into 5 digits. I don’t need more than that. I just want to make enough money to crawl out from under my debt. I feel like I am in this fight alone and it’s frustrating because I don’t know how to fight. I have read articles and have tried to teach myself to fight but it’s not the same as sparring with someone. I hope this doesn’t come across as begging because that is not my intention. I’m just lost and could use a little guidance from experts who are fighting the system. If you read all of this, thank you for your time.|2021-02-01 08:09:24

And if the moon is to close for that group to explore, They stay strong together while reaching for more.   They travel together while blasting past Mars,  Moving as one while reaching for stars.   Soon Jupiter, Saturn are memories past, While the ship that they built continues to last.   And The journey's not done, it's not even close, They flew past Uranus, traveling further than most.   Neptune was next, and was easily taken,  Diamond hands in control, no CONFIDENCE shaken.   The groups only mission was to change what they saw,  A system thats filled with infinite flaws  But together they stood, each hand in hand Bringing new light to problems, facing the land  And In changing the world, it didn't take much Just billions of miles and new Heroes to us!!|2021-02-01 09:37:01

lm2zk0|la0n4z|la0n4z|8|Ok, so I'm a proud Gamestop shareholder, but i'm pretty new in the stock exchange, and was wondering if you can help me explain ...  I think I understand the general concept of shorting (borrow shares, sell them, wait till drop, buy them, give back shares). The person who borrows the shares pays fees for doing so (otherwise, why would the one who supplies them agree to it, de facto betting against himself). What are those fees exactly?  Now, all those original short positions of 120% of the float were made when the stock was very low, they would need to lower the price significantly for them to not make tremendous losses when buying back shares. Though all the shorts that were made last week during/after the skyrocket, wouldn't they make a lot of money on those aswell if the price is where it's at now (lower than when the extra shorts were made)?  So would it be possible that they use those extra shorts to offset the costs of the initial shorts, and are opting to play the waiting game, very gradually closing off both without raising the daily trading volume too much? Or would the costs of those initial shorts still be way too much to be able to play that game for an x amount of time?  For example, If I short at $10, and it jumps to $300, I lose a lot of money. But if I throw in a lot of extra shorts at $300, and the price drops to $200 (due to, well, the stuff we see happening) would that give me the breathing room needed in order to start slowly selling off both without triggering a squeeze?|2021-02-01 10:04:02

lm4a9e|la0n4z|la0n4z|8|The COVID Crisis shook America to the core as most of the world. State Governments shut small businesses down, and locked us in our homes. While our families died in the hospital, they danced on their corpses, they printed money devaluing the currency, making us poorer than ever.  But while friends of mine ate bologna and ramen cups drinking tap water, These bastards on Wall Street and in the Government, ate Caviar and Drank Unicorn Blood. While your Grandma died in her home because the hospitals wouldn't allow her in to "stop the spread" While your Aunt lay there dying alone, without seeing her loved one's face, one last time. These bastards partied, bought expensive yachts, and ate the ass of big government. They lined the pockets of Government and themselves. But when we found a way to fight back, and play the game. They got big daddy government to put their boot on our necks, and snap it. But don't be so easily tread upon, Don't Tread on Me means something.  Because if you try to step on a snake the snake bites you, I want you to proverbially drag these Hedgefund managers out of their offices, and break their skulls against the curb, and piss on them, like they did 13 years ago, and last year. Keep up the fight and join your movement in Zuccotti Park, make a tent, and reoccupy wallstreet.|2021-02-01 10:12:16

llfbfk|la0n4z|la0n4z|3|RH Clearinghouse question.  Robinhood says they halted/limited trading due to the high fees or collateral requirements due to volatility and that they just didn't have enough to deal with the $3billion bill that came through.    Am I correct in understanding that's not costing them anything as a business but just good faith initial payment until customers funds settle?  Doesn't the clearing process occur throughout the day?  I can wire and verify money instantly so I can't understand why RH can't easily confirm a customer has cash to pay for the trade.  Please help.  Thanks|2021-02-01 07:16:59

llsahd|la0n4z|la0n4z|3|A word of encouragement from Europe:  *Disclamer:   I'm a certified nematode-sized smooth-brained monkey when it comes to  investment, as my portfolio to date will testify to.  I'm not giving  anyone any kind of financial advice!*  At  first, when this GME rumble started going off, I just kind of leaned  back and thought to myself "good for them -- they spotted an investment  opportunity and took it."  Now, I'm  waiting for about a $5k transfer to clear into my deposit, and I'll be  in on the movement.  I am fully prepared (and somewhat expecting) to  lose every cent of that, but I want to join the retard squad, and here's  why:  I see the shady af stuff  going down with hedge funds manipulating the market, news, and media  because someone has picked up the gauntlet and is sparring with them on  their own court.  These people are billionaires that have made a living  out of bankrupting retail investors and companies for decades.  And now  they're trying to throw shade at someone outside their club joining the  game and standing up to them; and they're trying to change the rules  halfway through.  They can go to hell, and I'll do my small part to  stand up to them.  We probably won't see anything like this again in our  lifetime.  They're facing an army of fucking 💎🙌 that call *themselves* retards, autists, and monkeys.  A tough proposition to deal with to say the least.  Fight  the battle to your own comfort.  RECLAIM some of your wealth that  they've ruined peoples' lives to acquire.  Do good tings with it!  That's all.  Have a nice day.|2021-02-01 08:59:09

lm4z4b|la0n4z|la0n4z|3|Buy more GME. Buy silver too, just not the worthless paper stocks like SLV. Buy Physical and you fuck over the paper buyers (Citadel and Banks).      Silver does actually have potential to be a bullet through the banking industry, but not with paper shares and mining stocks. If enough people demand physical delivery and buy physical stock, then it will be meaningful.      It is a long term investment that wont devalue to 0. That's about it. Don't sell your GME for any moves into other assets, but all the silver bashing is to the benefit of citadel as well.      I understand if you all disagree, but I think that we are being double played here. Obviously they know we will rail against their obvious coordinated move to promote slv. This is just a distraction to get people off the physical side of things and protect them from the bubble pop that will actually kill their system.|2021-02-01 10:16:38

They’ve borrowed high interest shares to cover calls the next few days and they’ll prod for weakness here and there with short ladder attacks (HOLDing doesn’t help that there’s no new capital to stop those attacks). But I bet nothing exciting happens for a few days while they wait for people to get bored and chase the next get rich quick meme stock. Then they bury GME.   They know the collective intelligence of the average retail new trader. What’s better then 8 minute abs?  SEVEN.MINUTE.ABS!!

lm0rok|la0n4z|la0n4z|9|Nokia has:  Positives -  No debt 90,000+ employees 5G contracts in EU Has a lead on 6G R&D in EU Makes chipsets for most major brand networking switches (Cisco) Retains 20K patents on various telco technologies Has won a $14 million contract with NASA to set up communications infrastructure in the moon (who knows where this could lead if successful - beyond the MOON?) In 1964, their research department discovered cosmic microwave background radiation - they have the resources to discover other interesting endeavors They are transparent in their business dealings, partnerships, and current/upcoming projects, they will also start releasing quarterly financial reports as well Outside of China, they own 27% of the world's telco infrastructure Moving to cloud services like storage and software (SaaS) Internet of Things in the Healthcare industry My 3310 from the year 2000 is still running and has not needed to be plugged in to charge yet  Negatives -  They have lost out on their contract with the 5G rollout in China. They were only involved in phase one, but did not win a tender to participate in phase two. Only Ericsson and Huawei won that round  I think it is a decent long term stock. And at $4.7 - $5 a stock, it is nothing to lose sleep over. They are not gonna go out of business, and you are not going to get wiped out.

llf686|la0n4z|la0n4z|8|Since GME supposedly isn't doing great on the business side, and we are now all carrying it through something like a corporate hospital and rejunevation center, who else wants to see them become like a modern arcade and fun-zone?  I'm particularly thinking something like a group of people rent hololenses and play through AR levels in rooms. All they need are old warehouses to renovate. Maybe everyone goes in limited groups and gets quick-tests to help prevent the new strains from killing us, and the air can be sucked through the rooms at a fast enough speed to give a breeze which would generally keep us from breathing eachothers' emissions too. Make it a windy alien planet setting or something.  They can also have VR pods or whatever for all that stuff, but I want to run and dodge for real too 🦍  &#x200B;  Lol, "get in the game"|2021-02-01 07:15:31

lleus2|la0n4z|la0n4z|5|I was just surfing and came across this helpful article BWAHAHAH!:  " To see your future without a crystal ball:  Use the rule of 72 to calculate how long it would take  an investment to double. The rule of 72 is that an investment that earns  10 percent interest will double in 7.2 years. Use this as a starting  point for calculating various interest rates and lengths of time, by  dividing the number 72 by your interest rate. For instance, if you are  investing at a more conservative rate of 5 percent, you’d divide 72 by 5  for a total of 15 years (rounded up) for your money to double.                 To figure out how long it would take your money to  triple, use 115 instead of 72. So at an interest rate of 3 percent, it  would take 38 years (115/3), for your initial amount to triple."|2021-02-01 07:12:16

llbmkf|la0n4z|la0n4z|6|Hey squad,  I've been doing my own casual learning and investing for several years now. I started reading from around 2018-2020 then I could obviously see it was a good time to invest and what little money I had went all in. Since then I have slowly been piling more and more I'm and making returns (holding all until full recovery) and I though I had a good grip on investing and the market.  To keep this short and sweet, I learned this week I know shit, so where did you all learn I'm willing to pay to learn as well if needed.  Thank you all 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-01 06:37:41

The insiders also bought massive short positions just before they announced this change. That was insider trading but the courts sided with the thieves.  That effectively halted the run on silver and screwed all the little investors royally.   Please pass it along to avoid highly leveraged positions because the insiders will change the rules to rig it in their favor this time, again.|2021-02-01 05:41:12

Compare that to GME 22,6 Billion (only 1,8 billion in December)  If you buy SLV it would not effect the price very much because the market cap is just 2 big. Your buying of SLV will not push the price to trigger a short squeeze. And ignoring all the fundamentals and Numbers, there are no Hedgfunds that r shorting SLV, on the contrary the major Hedgfunds (including Citadel) r ball deep in SLV!  They're desperate AF! Now they're trying every possible way to get out of this bad situation. All those news and articles about a possible short squeeze in SLV is just an attempt to shift the focus of the stocks that r near mooning!  Hold the Stonks you like!

We want to take this opportunity to clarify that it is never eToro’s goal to close positions. As an online investment community we exist to enable our users to participate in the capital markets.   Manual positions on our platform are kept open as long as the requested Take Profit or Stop Loss rates are not reached in the market or a manual request is not made to close the position.  As a regulated broker, we must always act in line with the regulations of the regions in which we operate and within the scope of what the market can offer.  Some corporate events, such as delistings, and certain market events, such as contract rollovers (for example on instruments like Copper or ChinaA 50) may cause a position to close at the last traded rate.  From time to time there may also be extraordinary circumstances that will require positions to be closed or for trading limitations to be applied. These circumstances could include regulatory requirements, new laws or directives and/or risk management decisions. Such events may come with advance notice, while others may not but we will inform our users of any changes as soon as we can.  We hope that this explanation is reassuring. We strive to provide the very best service investment experience for our clients.    Sincerely,  The eToro Team|2021-02-01 05:39:24

The app keeps telling that it'll "buy at the best available price", but I don't get if it means that it'll cost me more for my order or they'll buy less shares for my investment.

I Wasn’t able to transfer funds from bank to broker due to it being the weekend. And now that it’s Monday, I’m still not allowed to make a transfer until Tuesday.

llve81|la0n4z|la0n4z|2|Reasons to hold AMC:      It's in the unique position of being both a "short" and "long-term" investment. The dip is due to pandemic. Check back Around 2 years ago. Steady around $20. When restrictions around pandemic are lifted, there will be a huge rocket, then it will likely even out.

llaixm|la0n4z|la0n4z|6|One thing I don’t understood is: are the hedge funds still shorting GME? I’m no retard, or at least not the good kind so I don’t have a good grasp of how it works.   My understanding was that all those hedge funds lost their shorting positions because the stocks grew well above what they gambled.   How does it work? Are their position still shorted? How much! What percentage of what was initially shorted? I read something like 71 million shares were being shorted currently?  Any link to officially retarded monkey trolla appreciated.   While I had no part in this I’m still so fucking proud of you guys for sticking it to the man. And to think I was only here for the fun.

If so, they have a particular date? Is it a public date? If they don't, how you can predict that last week/this week the squeeze could be done and they would have to buy?  It's legal to short options above 100% stocks right? Who regulates and controls this? How can they let it happen?

llvx6o|la0n4z|la0n4z|3|Bought $17 shares at $300.88  Could have done better. I set a Trailing STOP buy order with a +10% to go in effect when GME MRKT <=$300. It should have filled at about $296, but it filled at $300.88. Why? Because the trading volume is so small this AM, it takes literally about a minute for the buy order to execute. So, once GME went under $300 and my Trailing Stop went active, it was trailing the MRKT price by +10%. At some point at about  $260, the direction of GME reversed itself, so my Trailing Stop froze (that's how it's supposed to work) at about $296 (260 + 0.1\*260=296). Once GME went above $296, my Trailing Stop order became a Market order. Why didn't it fill at $296? There were too many people in line to get GME and not enough to sell. So, it sold at MRKT once my turn came. At that point, the MRKT price was already $300.88.  I learned my lesson. Look at the trading volume before deciding on whether to use a Trailing STOP or a Trailing Stop LIMIT. If I had set a Trailing Stop Limit at +10%, then once GME reversed its fall this AM and started climbing up, my order would have become a LIMIT order at $296 instead of having become a MARKET order. This means that the order would not have filled at MRKT price but at the price that is lower than my LIMIT, which was $296. Curiously, GME reversed itself again within a minute or two and went under $296. I would have bought my GME shares at $296 or lower if I had set a Trailing Stop LIMIT instead of a Trailing STOP.  But, you have to know exactly what you are trying to achieve. Because if after hitting $296 on the way up, GME would have gone up and up and up, I would have been left with an active buy LIMIT Order waiting for the price of GME to fall below $296 to fill my order. And that may not have happened at all, so I could have missed out on being able to fill this order just because I wanted to save $4 per GME share.  Another observation: You guys are holding the line well. There is not many shares being sold.|2021-02-01 09:21:39

ll8zp8|la0n4z|la0n4z|4|Crossposted this on the AMC OP, but thought I'd ask here.   New member after lurking for awhile, w/ AMC, BB, BBBY, and NOK through Merrill Edge.  I followed the suggestion by a member here to keep my stocks from being "borrowed" by hedgers by putting high sales limit orders on them (in the $200-$300 range.)  Two questions about the differences and potential purposes of limit orders and stop limit orders.  1. Does a stop limit order (which isn't viewable by other brokers until executed) still keep my stocks from being borrowed (what the Redditor suggested in order to keep hedgies from using them to manipulate the market)? 2. Is there an advantage to doing a "limit order" vs a "stop order, given that with limit orders other brokerages can see the prices at which we're selling and thus our determination to hold? If everyone here whose putting high sell orders on their stocks to prevent borrowing chose a limit vs a stop order, would that send a stronger unified message?  Thanks for such a great site!|2021-02-01 06:06:15

llqo7c|la0n4z|la0n4z|3| Here’s what I like about AMC and I’m just another one of you idiots with small money trying to stick it to the man.  1. It’s still affordable, compared to GME, which is too rich for my blood in a time when many firms are not allowing you to buy fractional shares. Now seems to be the time to hold hold hold GME.  2. It has received a ton of publicity alongside GME and could skyrocket this week. For a lot of folks who are looking to waive the finger at Wall Street but missed the boat on GME, AMC seems to be a jump in for those late in the game.  3. The movie theater industry has been on the decline and has been disproportionately fucked by the pandemic so maybe we can keep them alive so I can go buy a ridiculously priced movie ticket when this is all said and done. I still love going to movies especially now that you can buy booze at so many movie theaters.  Let’s do this! Buy and hold this sucker. And yes, you may well lose your shirt but let’s screw these hedge fund ass clowns and tip the scales in our favor again while we still can.  You know they are working hard to figure out how they can regulate us "retail investors" out of the market.  To the moon do you beautiful movie buff bastards.

The course of the travel company TUI has fallen sharply due to Corona and mismanagement so that the German state stepped in and bought shares.  The prospects of economic modes predict a further decline in prices duo to the pandemic. No one wants to fly i guess.  Would that theoretically be a candidate for an action like GME and why not?

lll23n|la0n4z|la0n4z|2|I don't know where to post to ask this so i'll start here........  &#x200B;  I opened a schwab account to try to get in on gme and/or amc on thursday.  Transferred money from my external savings account to schwab.  It cleared on friday.  I cannot purchase either of these stocks but CAN purchase other stocks like Ford.  &#x200B;  The error message I get even when trying to only purchase a single stock is.. " This order cannot be accepted because there are not enough cleared funds in this account to cover the requirement for first time trades. Trades may also be subject to share size and principal restrictions. Please consider reducing the size of your trade, or call a Charles Schwab representative at  877-368-8288 if you would like assistance with this trade. (CR315) "  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  so i contacted them via chat.  Shannon D was the support rep.  They said that all transfers from external accounts take 3 days to clear and then there's another 3 days on top of that that i'll need to wait because these are volatile stocks.  6 days of waiting?  i fear it will be too late on GME by then.  What am i doing wrong and who else could I use beside schwab to avoid a 6 day waiting period.|2021-02-01 08:08:06

llyly5|la0n4z|la0n4z|3|Hey you guys - keep HOLDING GME.    But, if you still have funds, you might want to get in on the GROUND floor for another short squeeze opportunity.  And here it is.  IFF Short Interest Feb 2, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw  Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  ​ Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls!  And then, look at the fut of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue.   People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company. But I am just a r* like you, so don't take this as investment advice.   And, much like DFV, I am just some guy in my basement.|2021-02-01 09:37:09

If these rumors of counterfeit stock counts are true, couldnt the hedge funds and clearing houses technically counter-fit stock counts all the way down so they can close out their short interest without any of us selling?  what is the community monitoring to keep everyone in check? where would one monitor all the live realtime stats on all this?|2021-02-01 09:12:12

lm46is|la0n4z|la0n4z|3| PSA, and to be aware of what is occurring in the financial markets  GME short interest is $8.82BN; 27.12M shares shorted; 53.15% SI % Float; borrow fee and easing to 10%.  GME shares shorted have decreased by -35.2M over the last week.  The more the short interests decrease, the narrative of Autists vs Hedge Funds ceases, and it becomes the traditional investor demand vs investor supply.  📷  Most of you wont like it, but you data is data, which you cannot argue against. Coupled with the inability to purchase stock or options, there is now significant downward pressure.  Be prudent, and set stop losses if you are in the money.

Alot of people have made alot of money and there not gonna hold forever regardless of what they might say. Life changing money isn't gonna be just chilling for a few months.

Did anyone else have this issue?  This what they emailed me below. Where should I move my stock buying to in the future? Upset. Thanks!  TD Email:  “We are in the midst of an unprecedented week in investing. It has included some of the highest-volume days in history.  I want to acknowledge that this week's trading volume and volatility across our entire industry has led to significantly increased call volumes and hold times for our clients, as well as challenges for some with our platforms at market open. Nothing is more important to us than serving you. We understand that service disruptions are frustrating and want you to know that we take these issues very seriously and sincerely apologize for any problems this may have caused.  In some cases, the volatility we are seeing in a small number of stocks has forced us to put restrictions in place. These restrictions will not prevent clients from buy and sell transactions. For the latest list of impacted stocks, visit tdameritrade.com/restricted.  We appreciate your patience and are committed to providing the high level of service and reliability you have come to expect from us.”|2021-02-01 08:57:32

llzks0|la0n4z|la0n4z|1|You guys know that likely it is not users on here that are selling and making the price go down. Or if they are on here they hold a lot more AMC than you do. The high for today only got up to $17, which is still better than Friday however, the pattern remains the same. Goes up, comes back down a few dollars, goes back up. There's no sustained buying at this point.  That's why with AmC if you are fresh buying,  set a limit to around $11 to $13 or if you think the bottom is about to fall again then $4 to $8|2021-02-01 09:42:57

lm0g1k|la0n4z|la0n4z|1|Question: I know very little about the GameStop crazy mess. I know it has something to do with people borrowing shares from someone and selling them elsewhere and then planning to buy them back at a lower price and keeping the difference. But, since the share price went up my understanding is they had to buy them back at a higher price to return them from where they borrowed them.   My question is, why do they have to pay the shares back specifically *now*? Couldn't they wait to buy them back/return them to the lender when the price goes down a bit?|2021-02-01 09:48:21

I don't plan on trading a lot, but if I can't buy a $5 stock and trigger it to sell automatically at $10, then what's the fucking point?|2021-02-01 10:11:12

lm4vn0|la0n4z|la0n4z|1|Hey you guys - keep HOLDING GME.    But, if you still have funds, you might want to get in on the GROUND floor for another short squeeze opportunity:  IFF - International Flavors and Fragrances  Here are some links about the short positions:  IFF Short Interest Feb 1, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw   Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  Check out the current number of shares available to short at the link below. Guess what, they are out of ammo, just like GME before it went big: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF   Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls! And having a Gamma squeeze for 17m shares out of the 'float' of 80m is CRAZY.   EVEN IF THERE IS NO SQUEEZE :  Look at the past and future of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue, yet their stock price is down?   Perhaps we are seeing the same nonsense the shorts did to GME, selling counterfeit shares to try and force them into bankruptcy.    People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company. But I am just a r* like you, so don't take this as investment advice.   And I am just some guy in my basement who likes to play dungeons and dragons. So I don't know shit beyond what I have posted.|2021-02-01 10:16:02

llshvy|la0n4z|la0n4z|2|Several weeks back, nobody, including myself, ever heard of WSB.  Then there was insanity on short squeeze of otherwise unremarkable stock.  Now everybody knows WSB - not serious insight, but just to state.  Anything WSB does moving forward will be covered, so comparing previous non-coverage of WSB, including initial run-up of GME to new activity (whether silver, gold, speaker cabinets, scrap plastic bags, etc.) will be covered everywhere.  IOW, from now on WSB is seen as market mover so will always be covered, thus popular coverage does not automatically mean crony shell game.  And, since WSB is a "new" phenomenon, it is going to get more attention at this moment than it will in the future, because it is generating a lot of clicks (ultimately, this is what news responds to). (NB4 - "new" phenomenons are usually around ten years in the making.)|2021-02-01 09:00:24

lm0myn|la0n4z|la0n4z|-1|Hey you guys - keep HOLDING GME.    But, if you still have funds, you might want to get in on the GROUND floor for another short squeeze opportunity.  And here it is.  IFF Short Interest Feb 2, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw   Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  Check out the current number of shares available to short at: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF   Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls! And having a Gamma squeeze for 17m shares out of the 'float' of 80m is CRAZY.   EVEN IF THERE IS NO SQUEEZE :  Look at the past and future of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue, yet their stock price is down? Shorts me thinks...    People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company. But I am just a r* like you, so don't take this as investment advice.

As they track the culprit, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke's past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case."  i so excited|2021-02-01 09:22:58

lm593y|la0n4z|la0n4z|1|Ok, so I'm a proud Gamestop shareholder, but i'm pretty new in the stock exchange, and was wondering if you can help me explain ...  I think I understand the general concept of shorting (borrow shares, sell them, wait till drop, buy them, give back shares). The person who borrows the shares pays fees for doing so (otherwise, why would the one who supplies them agree to it, de facto betting against himself). What are those fees exactly?  Now, all those original short positions of 120% of the float were made when the stock was very low, they would need to lower the price significantly for them to not make tremendous losses when buying back shares. Though all the shorts that were made last week during/after the skyrocket, wouldn't they make a lot of money on those aswell if the price is where it's at now (lower than when the extra shorts were made)?  So would it be possible that they use those extra shorts to offset the costs of the initial shorts, and are opting to play the waiting game, very gradually closing off both without raising the daily trading volume too much? Or would the costs of those initial shorts still be way too much to be able to play that game for an x amount of time?  For example, If I short at $10, and it jumps to $300, I lose a lot of money. But if I throw in a lot of extra shorts at $300, and the price drops to $200 (due to, well, the stuff we see happening) would that give me the breathing room needed in order to start slowly selling off both without triggering a squeeze?|2021-02-01 10:18:23

lm1ar9|la0n4z|la0n4z|1|XRT (ETF made up of 20% GME) had AUM decrease from 700 to around 175mil. This is because people holding XRT did in-kind redemptions to get a hold of GME shares. This also decreased the float from around 10 mil to around 20 mil shares. On Friday, short interest was around 12 mil, it was about 140% of the float. Because of in-kind redemptions, this should put short interest % at around 600% of the float.  This could be an EPICLY retarded short squeeze. It either squeezes and they issue a bunch more shares and it drives the price of the ETF into the ground or it rockets to Jupiter. A straddle seems prudent here.|2021-02-01 09:53:36

lltde2|la0n4z|la0n4z|-7|Not sure if this comment will be deleted as per... anyway I have actually been both a day trader and longterm investor for a few years now. Now is the time to capitalize on our power in numbers and short squeeze the US dollar! The fed gives al their money to the treasury and in return the fed prints more bullshit paper because of all the bonds they purchased from The treasury balancing the books because it increases their assets ‘on paper’. This is all nonsense and is unsustainable which is why cryptocurrency is more relevant now than ever. So we must cooperate together and all short the US dollar while investing in B. T. C. This is the best way we can stick it to Wall Street because no bank in the US isn’t heavily exposed to the US dollar fluctuations. This is similar to Micheal Burry’s short on the US housing market except instead of a recession this would pave the way for gold 2.0s rise and over all democratization of finance across the world. Wallstreetbets is about fighting fire with fire and winning. Don’t jeopardize this subreddits integrity by inflating the value of fomo stocks.

lm2nop|la0n4z|la0n4z|-3|Hey you guys - keep HOLDING GME.    But, if you still have funds, you might want to get in on the GROUND floor for another short squeeze opportunity:  IFF - International Flavors and Fragrances!   And here are some links about the short positions:  IFF Short Interest Feb 2, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw   Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  Check out the current number of shares available to short at the link below. Guess what, they are out of ammo, just like GME before it went big: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF   Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls! And having a Gamma squeeze for 17m shares out of the 'float' of 80m is CRAZY.   EVEN IF THERE IS NO SQUEEZE :  Look at the past and future of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue, yet their stock price is down? Shorts me thinks...    People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company. But I am just a r* like you, so don't take this as investment advice.   And, much like DFV, I am just some guy in my basement.|2021-02-01 10:02:00
llrwya|la0n4z|la0n4z|-8|As a legitimate silver investor since late 2019, I’m conflicted by this price action. I believe silver is an undervalued commodity and deserves its newfound popularity, but comparing it to what’s going on with GME and AMC is just wrong. Buy SLV if you believe it’s undervalued, not because you think it’s a “short squeeze” and will hurt “the big guys.”|2021-02-01 08:56:49
llkdw6|la0n4z|la0n4z|-5|I feel like the flack towards RH is misplaced; should it not be directed at the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) / Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) which made up a random large amount of money ($3Bill) RH had to deposit so as to keep its position as a financial institution?   Vlad says he had no choice really but to limit buying and pony up a bunch of capital on the NSCC/DTCC directive. It sounds like they are calling the shots for RH, and RH might have had no choice.  So Vlad notes this in his chat with Elon here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=6242&v=Cba53J1jyPM&feature=youtu.be&ab\_channel=TeslaDosage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=6242&v=Cba53J1jyPM&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=TeslaDosage) (1:47:19 - 1:50:19). In this he notes that the DTCC used an opaque formula to come up with this number and added a "discretionary" multiplier (which sounds like a we made this up factor). Elon seems even suggests that this is what that is.  Then additionally if you look into the DTCC board of directors you will see some legacy characters who have worked for Solomon Brothers and Lehman Brothers. So not too sure about the DTCC's background but it seem their board is pulling the shots not RH. [https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board) (link to NSCC/DTCC board of directors)  &#x200B;  Anyways, these are some thoughts.

Institutions have it easier they don’t have to worry what other entities will do as much. You have to worry about what the possibly million other people are doing. Prisoners dilemma on an epic scale. And evidence has shown that in multiple instances of the prisoner dilemma occurring at the same time, the individual typically saves themselves over others.

lm4dal|la0n4z|la0n4z|-3|Hey you guys - keep HOLDING GME.    But, if you still have funds, you might want to get in on the GROUND floor for another short squeeze opportunity:  IFF - International Flavors and Fragrances  Here are some links about the short positions:  IFF Short Interest Feb 1, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw   Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  Check out the current number of shares available to short at the link below. Guess what, they are out of ammo, just like GME before it went big: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF   Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls! And having a Gamma squeeze for 17m shares out of the 'float' of 80m is CRAZY.   EVEN IF THERE IS NO SQUEEZE :  Look at the past and future of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue, yet their stock price is down?   Perhaps we are seeing the same nonsense the shorts did to GME, selling counterfeit shares to try and force them into bankruptcy.    People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company. But I am just a r* like you, so don't take this as investment advice.   And I am just some guy in my basement who likes to play dungeons and dragons. So I don't know shit beyond what I have posted.|2021-02-01 10:12:50

llxw2g|la0n4z|la0n4z|-57|If you're holding any of the following: GME, AMC, BB, NOK, congrats on buying the top! I'm all for the movement of sticking it to the scumbag hedgefunds, but at this point you're holding shares of a company that is extremely overinflated in price, has shitty fundamentals (do any of you buying actually look at balance sheets? I doubt it. Cash reserves and debt to total cap are going to be really shitty here), and there's just nothing to realistically justify the price at this point. These companies are higher than they were pre-pandemic and their outlook is much shittier. You can downvote me to oblivion if you want, it'll probably happen. I'm just trying to talk some sense to you people to help you keep your money when this forum has essentially reached mob mentality|2021-02-01 09:33:03

llce8f|la0n4z|la0n4z|-13|Been trying to post this for days.  RIDE is going to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀  Please stop removing this some people actually wanna hear about companies other than GME.$RIDE Lordstown Motors 🚀🚀🚀🚀  First of all this chart is one gigantic ascending fucking triangle, 🐂🐂🐂. That’s insanely bullish.  Second the company is sound and has some first mover advantages. First to market EV pickup, The Endurance, expected September 2021. Purchased an GM plant with the capability of producing 600k vehicles a year to help speed up production.   Third the environment is right. Biden wants the US government to use a 100% EV fleet.  Earnings are on 2/15 where they’re pre orders will probably blow expectations out of the water once again, and any mention of a potential government contract would send the stock soaring.   I’m hoping we break this ascending triangle pattern and ride the EV wave to new highs going into earnings.  Maybe I’ll earn some trendies 🚀🚀🚀🚀but prob not since I’m fucking retarded and live on my wife’s boyfriends couch. This is not financial advice.|2021-02-01 06:46:13
lld34d|la0n4z|la0n4z|-10|Okay... So I understand all the noobies are trying to buy AMC. Has the thought occured to you that the run-up were the shorts covering? The short interest for AMC is not high at all and market cap is enormous. It will not squeeze. GME is the play and always has been. All these people saying “I can’t afford GME” then buy partial GME shares because I know your ass is on robinhood still. With 100$ on Robinhood you can turn it to 1k. With 100$ in AMC you can turn it to 50$.|2021-02-01 06:53:40

ll5llp|la0n4z|la0n4z|-5|Noob question - when you sell a stock on Robinhood should you just sell it as is - or should you put a limit order when you sell? Basically what’s the smartest way to sell so you don’t fuck yourself. I’ve seen ppl say to sell a certain way to protect yourself. I’m not asking because I’m planning on selling I’m just curious as a newb. What does the limit order do when you click sell - just make sure it doesn’t sell below that price ?|2021-02-01 05:22:08

llz966|la0n4z|la0n4z|-5|I feel really sorry for the good retailers who were suckered into GME after last Thursday.   Please look up who are the 10 largest holders - holding MILLIONS of shares of GME. They’re all hedge funds. They were the ones dropping the price last week and riding back up on the huge swings and now they’re making bank dripping mopping this onto the teens and below again.  Just look up who holds GME. The idea that only retail Investors held GME was always a lie. We were always a minority in the overall float. Once the major players decided to teach retail gamblers a lesson there was no turning back.   There will be a rebound but I wouldn’t chase it. This is on a terminal spiral from here on out. Instead of occasional dips you’re really seeing occasional spikes - don’t buy the spikes or believe the spikes mean a comeback.   Buy AAPL or some real long term stocks if you still have funds after this - don’t invest in sticking it to the hedge funds because the hedge funds also own large long positions. I can’t believe nobody looked this up or realized it.  Anyway - all the best to the GME gang|2021-02-01 09:40:59

IFF Short Interest Feb 2, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw  Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  ​ Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls!  And then, look at the fut of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue.   People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company.

lm1gam|la0n4z|la0n4z|-10|Hey you guys - keep HOLDING GME.    But, if you still have funds, you might want to get in on the GROUND floor for another short squeeze opportunity:  IFF - International Flavors and Fragrances!   And here it is.  IFF Short Interest Feb 2, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw   Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  Check out the current number of shares available to short at: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF   Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls! And having a Gamma squeeze for 17m shares out of the 'float' of 80m is CRAZY.   EVEN IF THERE IS NO SQUEEZE :  Look at the past and future of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue, yet their stock price is down? Shorts me thinks...    People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company. But I am just a r* like you, so don't take this as investment advice.   And, much like DFV, I am just some guy in my basement.|2021-02-01 09:54:32

llr4tp|la0n4z|la0n4z|-31| **WHY AMCX IS THE NEW GME, AND NOT AMC**  AMCX has a shares float of about 25M with almost 60% of stocks being shorted. Furthermore, the short interest ratio is at 11.0, meaning **we can buy up this stock for 11 days, rallying up the price before short sellers are able to cover their positions, which in turn creates an even greater upswing in the stock price once short sellers are squeezed out of their positions.**  AMC has around 100M shares availible for trading vs AMCX with around 25M shares, **25% fewer stocks availible for trading, making it 4x more volatile**. Furthermore, AMC has a volume of about 600M against AMCX with a volume of ONLY 2M(!!!). Despite a volume of 600M, this has not made the AMC stock volatile as the short interest ratio (days to cover) is only 0.6, meaning short sellers can liquidate their positions at ANYTIME.  **With a short ratio of 0.6 there is no catalyst for a real short rally for the AMC stock.** However, IMAGINE if we can harness this kind of volume for the AMCX stock with only 25M shares outstanding and a short interest ratio (days to cover) of 11.0. With AMCX having a short float of close to 60%, with 25% fewer outstanding shares and 11 days for short sellers to cover thieir positions this makes the AMCX stock LETHAL compared to AMC.|2021-02-01 08:51:56

IFF Short Interest Feb 2, 2021 https://imgur.com/gallery/UF3eLAw  Look at that tasty 62m shares sold short, look at the utilization. Look at the float of 82m, yet 98.7% institutional ownership of the 106m share issued.  ​ Also, look at the $150 strike calls for Feb 19th. Yeah, there are 177,384 of them... Me thinks someone is hiding their shorts in this stock under naked calls!  EVEN IF THERE IS NO SQUEEZE :  Look at the past and future of this company. TRIPLED their dividend in 10 years! They are just about to complete the acquisition of a big chunk of DuPont, and then start growing even more.  In the last 4 years, they went from $3b in revenue to $5b in revenue, yet their stock price is down? Shorts me thinks...    People always want food that tastes good, and to smell good too.  I own positions in this company, and stand to benefit if the price goes up. Because no shit I believe in this company. But I am just a r* like you, so don't take this as investment advice.

llf2fp|la0n4z|la0n4z|-51|SLV to $1000  Reddit's Silver Rush Is Another Symptom of Market Madness -- Heard on the Street -- Update  2/1/21, 2:12 PM In 1896, former U.S. lawmaker and silver lover William Jennings Bryan attacked those that would "crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." Reddit investors now risk building their own cross of silver.  On Monday, the price of silver futures jumped about 11% to around $30 an ounce -- its biggest one-day move since 2009 -- after becoming the latest target of the individual investors who spent last week foiling Wall Street's short bets. By coordinating security purchases online, these amateur day traders have triggered surges in unloved stocks such as GameStop, BlackBerry and American Airlines.  "Silver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth," user RocketBoomGo wrote Saturday on Reddit, encouraging individual investors to push the silver price up to $1,000. "Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know [that a] billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation."|2021-02-01 07:14:26

As it stands, we are looking at needing 250k to buy property and build on it to basically help others. Plant lots of food in outdoor garden, an orchard and a greenhouse. With help from the local community (probably mostly homeless) we will have quite a bit to give away.   An area set up for a homeless tent city (so safe place to camp without worry of cops). A couple of community buildings (a shower/bathroom/laundry) and a kitchen/dining area.   Also plans for solar and a well. And raising chickens and goats and stuff, eventually. But, it's gonna take money.   Our current plan involves hubby driving truck for at least 10 yrs.|2021-02-01 05:58:49

lldbq1|la0n4z|la0n4z|-29|I just got off the phone with UMICORE and they are already running low on silver. They said to fill a 100kg order of silver I would have to go through one of the german banks they sell to. Ive also spoken to the biggest bullion dealer in the UK and they have 50kg of silver bars left, and are waiting for delivery of more, but they could not tell me when this delivery would be or how much is coming.  We also have to look at the silver used in manufacturing, and the potential situation that the manufactures may be in. If they think a silver bull run is going to start, they will be stocking up on spot and contracts too.  &#x200B;  edit: all the morons thinking this is a bearish comment you need to google supply and demand. The fact that they are running low on silver is amazing for this rally and is the exact reason it would work stated in the OG post.|2021-02-01 06:56:12

We've joked for years how they pay diddly squat for used games and then flip that shit 300 times over for straight profit, they have dirty ass stores filled with funk pops and junk that real gamers couldn't give less of a shit about, and have their asshole employees always push used games/disc protection (?? bitch, do you know how resilient double sides bluray discs are??) and try to make bullshit game convo when you can tell they know shit all and are just pulling from a playbook of nerd garbage to regurgitate. Melvin Capital didn't drop their business year after year, they did it to themselves and we all know it. They just decided to cash in on the opportunity.

ll54me|la0n4z|la0n4z|-23|Challenge Update:  I said I was done trading for January, but I couldn't resist making two more purchases.  2 more shares of GME @ 300  \+20 SLV 30c 4/12 @ 1.35  Don't plan on holding the SLV too long, will prob sell when it hits ITM which is approaching rapidly. The SLV calls have already boosted me over my 100% ROI target, which is great.  May be moving my trades in a completely different direction. Buying options rather than selling, and leaning bearish on broad market ETFs. We will see. February thread will be posted soon.|2021-02-01 05:15:38
