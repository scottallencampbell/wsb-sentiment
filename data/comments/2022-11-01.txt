uneqrd|yj4ki6|yj4ki6|6|The big play this week is Thursday's BoE meeting  The market is expecting 50-75bps and the BoE has been shown repeatedly to be super scared of big rate hikes. 1 MPC member even voted for a 25bps hike last time which is ludicrously weak.  They are gonna go for a 50 bps hike with a few members voting for 75bps and 1 or 2 voting for 25bps. This will spook the gilt markets, because this week they are also starting the QT program.   Gilts yields are going to be mad confusing because of the lower expected rate combined with QT. But the clear result is the pound will get weaker vs the dollar, esp because Daddy JPow will slap us with 75bps the day before  So I'm short the pound this week|2022-11-01 12:27:53

um4sq7|yj4ki6|yj4ki6|5|So this fed meeting goes one of two ways imo:   1) Fed blinks / pivots / goes dovish and the market totally rips. Inflation becomes runaway inflation and decimates the poor and middle class (I.e. working people) to the point where we get hyperinflation, no one can eat, and the people revolt.   2) Fed does not pivot / blink and they say we will keep rates elevated and will cause pain (a recession) and will hold rights high until inflation is back to 2% like he’s literally told us for 3 straight months.  As unemployment goes up and rates eventually come down, we return to normalcy|2022-11-01 06:57:03

um8dej|yj4ki6|yj4ki6|9|bruh its funny how people think jpow cant beat inflation and how the market keeps beating the fed  think about it, how can you bring down inflation to 2% without completely collapsing the economy and markets? the answer is to do it slowly over the span of 1-2 years, velocity matters  the feds approach has been to do 100 bil a month in QT, and hike rates \~2%, markets drop 10-20%, they then release a leak that says they are almost at terminal rates, markets regain most of the drop, now they can rinse and repeat, tighten up a few more %, every 10-20% drop in markets they release some bs to pump 10% and then start walking it back to continue the trek down  so far its working beautifully|2022-11-01 07:31:03

unw0k0|yj4ki6|yj4ki6|8|“How would you rate your cravings today? Still a 1 or 2?”  One week into rehab, you got your first “phone time” this afternoon. 30 minutes with your cell phone each week. That’s it. Instead of FaceTime with your wife and kids, you checked your options portfolio. It’s felt incredible this past week to not stare at 1s candles all day long, but it turns out those candles fuck you whether you’re watching or not. The 5-6 weeks-til-expiration positions you bought before admission into treatment are down big. Maybe you’ll rename “monthlies,” start calling them “rehabs.” They have 28 days to recover, just like you. And just like you, they probably won’t.  You contemplate the nurse’s question and think back to March 2020, when both your trading and drinking habits met and fell in love with the word “day.” Box of wine and $4,000 in 0DTEs gone by 3:59 PM, over and over again. You aren’t sure what was the chicken or the egg in your descent into *ism*, the gambling or the boozing. But you can’t detox from “investing,” so you chose to come here to dry out your liver, hoping that if you killed one evil conjoined twin of addiction, it might kill the other in the process. You hadn’t wanted to drink since you arrived here. Until you checked SPY this afternoon. A relapse on one creating a craving for the other.  You ball your shaking hands into fists, then look at the nurse. “10.”|2022-11-01 14:16:00

umrv2m|yj4ki6|yj4ki6|-2|**FOMC Ends With Powell Solemnly Pledging To Never Let The Markets Down Again**  A hushed press gallery bore witness to a pale and visibly shaken Jay Powell take to the podium Wednesday afternoon. His voice broke on several occasions as he fumbled through his prepared speech - noting the data driven approach the FED would continue to take and the desire to remain nimble going forward. However - to the astonishment of the press gallery - Powell burst into tears as he began to utter "75".  ***Excerpt from post-FOMC Press Conference --***  "I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. I am not a strong man - look at me. Oh I thought I could pull a Volcker. God, I hated the man with a passion. His damned cigar chomping and ... do you know he was perpetually drunk throughout the 80s? Do you think a sober man would raise rates like he did? But oh everyone wants me to pull a damn Volcker. Well I can't. I WON"T. I love each and every degenerate trader who dares to dream big and leverage the panties off of every trade, no matter how many accounts they blow. Well, I see you - I HEAR you. Ladies, gentlemen, traders of all persuasions -- I'm dropping rates by a 100 basis points and buying 150 billion dollars of mortgage-backed securities a fortnight."  The S&P instantly rallied 100% on the bombshell pivot. Powell - clearly excited and adrenaline-fuelled - began to disrobe and furiously masturbate over unsuspecting reporters while shouting "fuck you bears!" over and over.|2022-11-01 09:58:33

The major reason is not allowing the market to fall during midterms. Second,  job openings surged in September despite Fed efforts to cool labor market, and after midterms are over, the media will be back on the recession narrative and actually follow through this time. All the news thrown out today has been positive news for the economy, even if the data is skewed. The FED raises rates when the economy is strong, and Powell will mention that the economy is "robust and strong" several times tomorrow. Sometime later this month or early next month, they will throw out FED presidents to give statements about being more hawkish. It's going to be all theatre tomorrow.|2022-11-01 11:43:37
