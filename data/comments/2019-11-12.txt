7bn19p|dv8idy|dv8idy|10|**Magical Crayons TA** guy here. Just wanted to note we've hit the ranges I posted yesterday and touched the 309.8 mark, which we're now hovering around. I will not be surprised if we break it and go further to hit 310 or exceed it slightly, which is the ceiling for the wedge pattern (310.2). As I've made transparent if we maintain these ranges today, I will hedge a put position for a potential 1-2% correction before next Monday's close. If you're a bull, you want to see us break the 310 before EOD tomorrow and hold strongly above through to Thursday, the conclusion of the wedge pattern.  Meanwhile, AAPL is nearing the conclusion of its own wedge pattern, where I'm similarly hedged a few small puts. If it can trade flat and then show a reversal back up I'll exit the position, but for now its sort of at an inflection zone. The AAPL wedge should resolve before SPY's based on my crayons.|2019-11-12 09:37:05

7cg2jf|dv8idy|dv8idy|17|Time for **Magical Crayons TA**.  TA was accurate today, [trading in predicted ranges at EOD yesterday with a pullback at around 309.8.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/duyzt5/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_12/f79ndkj/) If you bought puts at that zone like [I suggested earlier,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv8idy/daily_discussion_thread_november_12_2019/f7bn19p/) you probably got a nice quick 20-30% return on the dip.  Unless there's a rocket in these closing minutes, we're trading outside the range of the rising wedge. As a result I've exited my put positions for the day and will monitor action tomorrow. Again, for bulls you would prefer a slower windup or consolidation at these levels (with increasing volume) to be assured there's more room to run ahead.  As I've stressed, there's economic news up ahead. Market can be a bit violent for the rest of the week. If I have time intraday I'll post observances. For now directionality is difficult to determine based solely on chart patterns. We traded essentially flat today despite some movement, and if we stay at these levels we'll close with a doji on the daily chart, which is not necessarily a solid predicator for market changes but is something traders look for. Thus algos, which currently run the market, may make us open red tomorrow because of it.  That said we are still in a bull market, there's just some choppy waters potentially ahead. Namely an unfilled gap to 307.2 which has not been met. If you're bearish I would call that a support to fill before EOD tomorrow if there's bad news, and for bulls if we reach that I would grab a few calls. We may not hit it of course, but it's just a price to watch for.  Good luck everyone, I'll see you tomorrow for the wild ride.|2019-11-12 14:44:49

7bt8op|dv8idy|dv8idy|2|Time for a nice short straddle at 299 on SPY (with options expiring in 2 weeks) ... Those puts are really overpriced atm, and I don't think that the call will go up THAT much before expiration ... If the market trend continues there's a good change for a 40+% gain, even before leveraging it ... Only risk if the spy suddenly crashes, but you should still get covered in the long run thanks to theta decay... I mean if SPY gets below 299 we are all fucked anyway right?
