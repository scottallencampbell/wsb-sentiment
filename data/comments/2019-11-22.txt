The goal of the event was pretty clear when he announced $100 deposit for reserving it. He just wants yuuuge pre orders. Then he will tweet 420K pre orders received and pump the stock.  And then use the full value of those 420K orders on Accounts Receivable and show fake yearly profits.  And now when it comes to delivery, he will move the timeline to 2022 etc...Who cares what happens then.|2019-11-22 05:15:21

In the coming decades, China plans to practice extremely overreaching influence into the economy (and indirectly the politics) of the West. We now see through the tariffs and other trade threats that AMERICA has all the leverage in trade negotiations, as China's economy so deeply depends on America to subsidize their labor and boost their GDP to insane levels they've been having in recent years. - NO MORE!|2019-11-22 10:51:01

Problem is people are afraid of change and he moved way too fast on this. He's becoming John delorean but with acid instead of coke.

Stalling as long as possible works better for 2, because it makes it seem that the deal was really hard to make.  Also, this guy is supposed to be 'art of the deal' man. If he can't make a deal, he's not really living up to his name. He knows the democrats will totally use that against him, and every campaign ad will be about art of the deal man failing to make a china deal. Plus, I'm guessing while the farmers like 'free money from tariffs', they're going to be pretty pissed about the useless agricultural equipment and all the soybeans he rallied them to grow.  Unless.

Trump said he stands both with the protesters and Xi.   >   >**‚ÄúWe have to stand with Hong Kong but I‚Äôm also standing with President Xi, he‚Äôs a friend of mine,** **he‚Äôs an incredible guy,**‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI stand with Hong Kong, I stand with freedom, I stand with all of the things we want to do. But we‚Äôre also in the process of making the largest trade deal in history. And if we could do that, that would be great. China wants it, we want it.‚Äù|2019-11-22 11:39:44
