o97v5m|xd3fhq|xd3fhq|20|Hate to say it, but JPow only has bad options in front of him:  Inflation staying this hot (8.3%) means that the wage-inflation gap is still over 3%.  The reason why consumer spending is staying up is massive dissavings by consumers; credit usage is skyrocketing and savings are dissipating.  This is completely unsustainable; at some point in the next 12 months the excess savings from Covid stimulus packages will be gone.  Fed has to prioritize bringing inflation back down to 2-3% even at the cost of a recession.  Fed funds rate needs to get to 4-5% fast even if forces some job losses along with negative growth.|2022-09-13 08:35:50

o93snv|xd3fhq|xd3fhq|49|This is bad.  Inflation is hotter than expected even with falling gas prices.  One of the biggest contributors is housing.  Housing costs are a lot more difficult to bring down.  Inflation is going to be  stickier than people have anticipated.  Rents are still going up everywhere, and they will keep adding to CPI for the foreseeable future.  Also, wait until the strategic petroleum reserves close in October. Gas is going to go back up again in the winter.  People are also going to get a shock over their heating bills with the price of natural gas.    We are repeating the 1970s all over again, where there is constantly stop and go and reverse because inflation is stubborn and won't go away. Then the FED brings the real bazookas and tanks the economy to purge inflation for good.  Remember, the real interest rate is *still negative*.  The FED is still being accommodating. WE haven't even seen real pain yet. Wait until the FED says enough is enough and starts to run positive real interest rates.  Can you say hello to 13% mortgages and auto loans?|2022-09-13 08:06:20

If you charged more for swallowing ($30 a dick) and could swallow about 12 loads a day, and suck an additional 16 dicks to lower your overall dick intake by 6 dicks a day, and while I've never sucked a dick I am pretty sure 6 less dicks a day would be worth the dozen loads, which would actually negate the need for packing a lunch and save you more money there too.|2022-09-13 08:13:05

Two years of so-called quantitative easing doubled the central bank’s balance sheet to $9 trillion, equivalent to roughly 40% of the nation’s gross domestic product.  >Now, with inflation rampant, the Fed is unwinding this liquidity via a process known as quantitative tightening, or QT. In June, the central bank started to shrink its portfolio by letting up to $30 billion of Treasuries and $17.5 billion of mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, roll off its balance sheet, or mature without reinvesting the proceeds. **The amount will double this month and effectively kicks in Sept. 15, as Treasuries are redeemed midmonth and at the end of the month.**  https://www.barrons.com/articles/federal-reserve-quantitative-tightening-stock-market-51662736146|2022-09-13 11:45:54

oa58s8|xd3fhq|xd3fhq|3|I've been buying SPY calls and puts with the same strike price 30 days out every time we've hit a point I doubt we're staying at (e.g. 425 a few weeks ago during that run up, 400 when JPOW wrecked the market the other week on a Friday, 390 last week, then I did 410 yesterday) and it's been working pretty well. I still feel like a retard when a barely get +30% roi on a 1-3 week play but at least I don't have to side with the bear-bull apes.  &#x200B;  If I could somehow time out when to sell *both* for profit I'd be frickin killing it though, get a 5 bagger on one and a +50% on the other lord please save my soul.|2022-09-13 12:06:34

Naturally he thinks he is stonk daddy. I told him over the last couple of months that $365 was nowhere near the bottom, and that this rally was all a fake. After weeks of him texting me talking shit, I finally agreed to a $500 bet with him that SPY will fall below $365 before Dec 2023. I can't wait to buy a bottle of Johnny Blue and a Wagyu Ribeye on his dollar, post a screenshot of him pushing the bet, every screenshot of him calling me a clown or a dumbass, and a screenshot of me enjoying my Johnny Blue and ribeye -- where I will tag him, for our +/- 800 mutual Facebook friends to see.|2022-09-13 10:16:25

Upon hearing the news, other retards came to visit. “Such bad luck,” they said sympathetically, “you must be so sad.”  “We’ll see,” the old retard replied.  The next morning his portfolio went up more than it went down.  “How wonderful,” the other retards exclaimed!  “Not only did your portfolio go up, but it went up even more than before.  What great fortune you have!”  “We’ll see,” answered the old retard.  The following day, news of bad CPI data came out and his portfolio tanked even further.  “Now you can't get that lambo” the other retards said.  “What terrible luck you have!”  “We’ll see,” replied the old retard.  The following week the market went up for no reason at all and the old retards hail mary 0dte calls 10x in value “Such great news. You must be so happy!” the other retards screeched.

I mean the 20 year is about to be at 4% during a period where the index’s are getting slaughtered and we expect rates to continue rising.   Is all of that irrelevant due to the inflation hits?   Theoretically buying 20 years this year locks in profits and if the fed magically gets inflation back to 2% in the next 18 months they might even make money?   Or is it more macro thing affected by the dollar blowing up? So other countries who historically bought them as reserve are not.   Just confused about the inputs and outputs on that particular index.|2022-09-13 07:56:33
