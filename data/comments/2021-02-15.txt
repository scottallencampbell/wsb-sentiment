As she calmly got out of her dress and into her jeans I explained that I was doing it for soon-to-be luxurious future. As she put her jewelry and toiletries in paper bags, I laid out gleefully and joyfully, step by step how rare it is to get shares like this under a dollar. As she put the dog in the back seat of her car I described the jaw-dropping vacation homes we will one day buy together in far, exotic lands. As she closed the trunk, got in the driver's seat and drove away, I walked down the driveway yelling after her how lucky we are to be on the same page about how to properly spend Valentine's Day money.

To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds.   >   >Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of [the WallStreetBets page](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=article_inline) on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock‚Äôs colossal rise. He was so enthusiastic about GameStop Corp. in late January that he took out a $20,000 personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to purchase shares. Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80%.   >   >"I thought it could go up to $1,000. I really believed in that hype, which was an awful thing to do," Mr. Vergara said.   >   >He plans to hold on to the shares because he believes in the company's turnaround, he said, and use his paycheck to cover the monthly payments on the personal loan.

nj5mp7|lkbfl4|lkbfl4|-12|Total individual and institutional ownership of $MDP is approaching 110%. That means that any share you buy is very likely being borrowed by a short seller that is looking to keep the value suppressed so that they can use the price action to cover. If we experience a high volume day the stock is going to increase very quickly as there aren‚Äôt enough available shares. The number of shortable shares keeps getting smaller everyday as new institutions initiate positions like the KOCH brothers just did with a new 1.6 million share position. The market cap is only 1.3 billion so with 110 percent ownership of the float every share purchase puts huge upward pressure. Institutions added very heavily to their positions last quarter and have had a month and a half to add even more. We are on the verge of a very big short squeeze if even one more buyer decides to take on a 5 percent position. Short interest is 4 million shares that don‚Äôt really exist in the market.|2021-02-15 07:20:32
