10mu75|tg6ojw|tg6ojw|14|I've concluded that we only trade to ultimately lose our money, we make small gains and big losses and then spend our time trying to win it back until we lose more. When losing the urge is to hold and hold until the loss is too big, then its too late. Essentially we are scared of missing opportunities and become too brave for our own good. Even when you win a shit load, you just lose it again.

This is what this is.  Barclays Bank PLC (“ Barclays”) announced today that it has suspended, until further notice, any further sales from inventory and any further issuances of each of the iPath ® Pure Beta Crude Oil ETNs due April 18, 2041 (Ticker: OIL; Exchange: NYSE Arca) and the iPath ® Series B S&P 500 ® VIX Short-Term Futures TM ETNs due January 23, 2048 (Ticker: VXX; Exchange: CBOE BZX Exchange), in each case effective as of the open of trading on Monday, March 14, 2022.  What this implies: Remember when Michael Burry called the banks if they were actually solvent to pay out his "puts" (for lack of a better term) if the housing market would crash. This is essentially Barclay's saying, shits about to hit the fan, and if too many investors have insurance in case of crash we'll go insolvent too.|2022-03-17 06:49:09

Also, we created an almost infinite supply of money so we can give you as much as you want.  &#x200B;  CEO's:  Hey, if we borrow a bunch of money at 0.25%, we can buy back enough stock to raise our market cap by 3.83%.  White House:  Wut?  &#x200B;  CEO's:  Then, after we've done that, we can go ahead and carve out new shares to give ourselves bonuses of about 1.5% of that cap we just created"  &#x200B;  White House:  Wait...  &#x200B;  CEO's:  Then, we're still up 2.33% on market cap, which will trigger the bonus gate in our employment contracts, which will give us even more money!  &#x200B;  White House:  No, not like that.  &#x200B;  CEO's:  This is strictly better than funding channel expansions, which would only increase cap by 1.1%.  We'll take 30 billion each, please and thank you!  Great plan, White House!  &#x200B;  White House:  Corporate America is why household dollars are worth less and prices are higher!  &#x200B;  God bless Democrats.

If anything this feels like the dead cat bounce from hitting 30 on the 5Y's RSI.  That and we have everything against a bullish case.

The reason is because we didn’t go to Iraq over the oil itself, but to sustain the petrodollar.

124tsl|tg6ojw|tg6ojw|8|The following charts highlight data from the past two weeks -- including readings on inflation, manufacturing and construction, consumer demand and the job market -- that form the backdrop to Powell’s upbeat view.        Inflation     Import price index ex-petroleum shows one of biggest gains since late-1980s          Consumer prices are already rising at the fastest pace in 40 years. A couple of reports this week suggest the pressures will persist. While soaring oil prices have grabbed plenty of attention, there was a sizable jump in the cost of imports last month, even when petroleum is excluded. And the producer price index in February saw the biggest annual increase in data going back to 2010.        Measure of input costs for factories in Philadelphia region highest since 1979          And while it only measures activity in one region and one sector of the economy, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s latest figures for March show inflation continues to run hot. An index of prices paid by factories in the region rose to the highest since Jimmy Carter was president more than 40 years ago. Perhaps more concerning was the pickup in a gauge of prices that manufacturers expect to receive for their products.         Manufacturing & Construction    U.S. factory production, new home construction gathered pace in February          Manufacturing and construction got back in the groove last month. Fed data showed factory output rose 1.2%, the most in four months, in a broad gain across industries after an omicron-related lull in January. At the same time, motor-vehicle production slowed as component shortages continued to disrupt assembly lines.        Residential construction also strengthened as the pace of new-home building raced ahead at the fastest pace since 2006. However, that kind of growth may be harder to come by later this year, as rising mortgage rates -- against a backdrop of high home prices -- could restrain sales. That explains why homebuilder sentiment throttled back in March to a six-month low.        Consumer Demand    Softening Spending    U.S. retail-sales measures pulled back in February after surge in prior month            Source: U.S. Commerce Department        Soaring inflation may be starting to affect consumer behavior at the margins. Government data this week showed retail sales rose just 0.3% in February after a 4.9% surge a month earlier. And the advance was primarily due to a 5.3% jump in receipts at gas stations, a reflection of the sharp increase in prices at the pump.        Sponsored Content    Digital Finance: The New MVP    Workday        High inflation is weighing more heavily on Americans’ psyche. The University of Michigan’s preliminary index of consumer confidence tumbled in early March to the lowest level since 2011 as year-ahead inflation expectations rose to a four-decade high. What’s more, a third of respondents expected their financial situation to get worse, more than twice the year-ago share.        Labor Market    U.S. job openings at 11.3 million are close to a record, showing tight job market          Job openings at the start of the year remained near a record high, suggesting the extreme tightness in the labor market that Powell pointed out this week. There were 11.3 million vacancies in January, down just a tad from the 11.4 million a month earlier.         “What you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person,” Powell said. “So that’s a very, very tight labor market. Tight to an unhealthy level, I would say.”        U.S. jobless claims falling this month while one regional employment gauge soars          March data suggest the job market remains red hot. The latest weekly report on applications for unemployment benefits shows claims now stand at the lowest of the year and a stone’s throw from levels not seen since 1969. The Philadelphia Fed’s measure of factory employment in the region climbed to a record.        TLDR: JPOW is full of shit and the economy is still in shambles.|2022-03-17 14:37:00

11qudd|tg6ojw|tg6ojw|4|If I was trying to destroy the US dollar, I don’t think I’d have done anything differently. 60% of dollars are held in foreign reserves. This massive inflation caused by ridiculous spending bills is a tax on the world. They’re already pissed. Then the sanctions on Russia have caused fear that they could be cut off. The petrodollar reserve system is predicated on oil exports and imports, not domestic oil consumption. China is the world’s largest importer of oil. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the UAE are the world’s biggest oil exporters. All 3 are moving off the dollar system to accept yuan. Expect hyperinflation a la Zimbabwe soon.|2022-03-17 13:07:20

Stock dumped back to $40-$45 and the day of the hearings a lot of smart apes bought again and made another 8x ROI.   Today bagholders try to hype the stock again and wants you to buy for over $80. Lol.  If i buy for this price and this goes to $300 i only make 3,5x ROI. Fuck GME buying for this price means you are potential future bagholder. Stock can go down another 50% in no time.

10oevu|tg6ojw|tg6ojw|2|If people are begging for a "fair crash" and spamming "this has to be fake" or "I dont trust this rally" or "imagine falling for this bull trap" that means there's more upside to come before bear testicles have been pressed and juiced for all they have. been happening non stop lately. Every week there's a new crop of people who think they're michael burry.   &#x200B;  "surely we will crash on the most transparently advertised bearish event in market history"   &#x200B;  We may have some downside but the idea that the market is going to price in everything this week after signaling for this since november is insane. it'll price everything in once FED related put/short plays expire/get kill.   &#x200B;  Thanks for coming to my Jerome talk.|2022-03-17 08:54:46

104f0e|tg6ojw|tg6ojw|1|It’s not just Pachter questioning the firm’s strategy. At the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, former Game director Reggie Fils-Aime told Bloomberg’s Emily Chang that he was rebuffed when he sought to share his expertise as a former Nintendo of America president with Cohen and his associates.  “There has not been an articulated strategy,” Fils-Aime said. “You can go on the Game website, try and find a strategy. There is no articulated strategy. Leadership says, ‘Well, we don’t want to articulate our strategy because they don’t want anyone to steal our strategy.'”  **The line drew laughter from the SXSW crowd.**  “I come from the business perspective that you need to articulate your strategy to all of your key constituents,” he said. “You need to communicate to your business partners; your vendors; your employees; your shareholders. And the three public boards I participate on all communicate their strategy.”|2022-03-17 05:47:52
