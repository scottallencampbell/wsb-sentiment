Works really well on SPY or QQQ that have 3 expirations per week. Sell 0-1dte OTM credit spreads, if it goes down your losses on the long are minimized. If it starts rallying your longs gain and you‚Äôll most likely have a chance to close your credit spread and choose a higher strike.

zz428j|ta5dee|ta5dee|12|I'm feeling very confident that today will have a good entry price for AMZN calls. The sideways action since Monday morning has been good to bring down the pricing.  The chain I'm looking at is March 25. Really Amazon swing up and down pretty quickly so this might be overkill, but I would like a little more time to see a full reversal.  I was saying before to target 3200. I think that's still doable, but I'm actually going to price the options versus 3100. This is bringing in some good offerings. The best as of last night was AMZN 2980c, which at 3100 would be $120 intrinsic, giving a 7.6x against the cost of $12.08. These are the kinds of multipliers we are looking for.  That said, the AMZN 2875c gives a 6x potential, which is a pretty heavy possible return, absolutely worth flipping a coin on. And because of the lower strike, it has a lot more potential in profitability. So, given last night's numbers, I'd say to adjust between 2875c and 2980c based on your risk tolerance.  And, to be clear, these numbers are going to change in five minutes. So, what I'm planning to do is wait ten minutes or so, let the option prices settle, and then enter when I find it most advantageous. I only detailed the above so you could do the same without waiting on me.  Edit: So, something you'll see is that nighttime prices for options can be wonky and I feel like that was probably the case here. I don't think those close prices were realistic and right now that range is giving more like a 5x so I don't recommend entering there. But I still feel like  good 6-7x options will show up today, so keep your eye on it.  Edit: 42 AMZN 3/25 2980c filled at $18|2022-03-09 08:27:38

zzn5tv|ta5dee|ta5dee|9|I entered into my [AMZN calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ta5dee/daily_discussion_thread_for_march_09_2022/hzz428j/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) earlier today. It was a good entry.  However, there's an aspect of this where the entire market could see a huge shift down because reasons likely to do with the war in ukraine. I don't anticipate this at all and in fact I feel the exact opposite is going to occur soon.  But just in case it does, it's always good to have a short position that can cover some of the losses if that does happen. Looking around, I decided to open a SHOP short position. I limited this to $17k because it's purpose really is to kick in and cover my losses. I put $75k into AMZN.  SHOP went up 9% today. Looking around, it wasn't really for any good reason, and stocktwits is full of hopium. It coming up lowered the price of the puts to where it's got a good chance of return, and this kind of blip up with no news easily gets erased in a few weeks. This is not an earnings play because expiry is well before April 27.  I went with 17 SHOP 470p 3/25 and it filled at $10. With a price target of 400, that's a 7x.|2022-03-09 10:38:40

zyjg41|ta5dee|ta5dee|7|Stay in cash gang bois!!!  Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping after having risen, this is the most reliable indicator signaling significant moves in the stock market. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. The s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now) Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.  AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.  Bull cases: WW3 might not happen. Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-03-09 05:08:20

00nsm4|ta5dee|ta5dee|6|The Fed funds rate should ALWAYS be higher than the inflation rate. Historically, it has been 200-300 basis points higher than inflation (before the financial crisis). They need to raise rates back to those historical norms. And true inflation is running over 15% - so that would put the Fed funds rate at ~18%. And on another point, they need to sell everything on their balance sheet back into the markets as well - it needs to be at zero within a year. Let's return to a free-market economy before it's too late.|2022-03-09 14:37:00

00hkj0|ta5dee|ta5dee|2|Was messing about yesterday trying to set a decent limit for MTCH 3/18 90p and ended up deciding on 7.50 literally as the price dropped from that point. Left it good for the day and the price rose again to \~7.45 before close but not quite to my limit, so no sell.  Today MTCH is up 13% and my puts have gone from being close $2,000 in profit to $-703 in the red.  Every other single time I have tried to sell and the price moves against me I just constantly edit the price and select mid-point to get rid of them. The only time i try to do it "properly" i get totally fucked :(     Was going to use those funds to continue to DCA into ASTS too. Absolutely couldn't make this stuff up ü§°|2022-03-09 13:56:18

How many of you idiots piled in to Wheat without realizing that the global Wheat trade is about 1% the size of the oil market? Who did you think was going to buy those massively inflated wheat contracts from you?  \- Governments don't tank their economies to put sanctions on a country. They will make sure they have a plan to make up that lost supply before capping themselves in the knee to teach someone a lesson.  Stick to GME conspiracy theories.

The reason behind the delay was straightforward: demand is sufficient enough for the company to be supply constrained even without bringing to market new vehicles. This is an advantageous position, particularly considering the challenging global supply chain environment. If there's any year to avoid a new model with new parts, this is it. And Tesla can do it without hurting its delivery growth potential. Indeed, management indicated that it can actually grow faster if it delays its new vehicles.  "The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output," said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.|2022-03-09 11:24:25

Perhaps start with a simple concept such as not needing banks and no one gives a fuck about it being backed by Gold or the USD. If you're feeling spry, maybe touch on the fact Uncle Sam can't freeze your fiat like Fuhrer Trudeau did to Canadians last month had they been using corn and hardware wallets. Perhaps also demonstrate your wisdom by providing your input on corn's hash rate correlation to price over time.
