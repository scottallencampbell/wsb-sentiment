If the answer is that you just don’t want to miss a potential move, **don’t fucking take the trade.** For some reason it’s hard to see that as fomo in the moment but that is literally what it is. Fomo doesn’t have to be when things are up, you can fomo into something that is going down just as easily thinking it may spike back up and that is even worse because the bias is against you.  I just pissed away about 20% of what I made yesterday doing this for no fucking reason. And it’s not even the money that pisses me off the most, it’s the poor strategy and the fact that I knew what I was doing was wrong when I did it but I did it anyways.|2022-03-09 11:09:54

zz7uce|ta5dee|ta5dee|6|Boyz, the way to play this market is to hedge. Buy long calls ATM maybe a month out. Sell call credit spreads for income. Works really well on SPY or QQQ that have 3 expirations per week. Sell 0-1dte OTM credit spreads, if it goes down your losses on the long are minimized. If it starts rallying your longs gain and you’ll most likely have a chance to close your credit spread and choose a higher strike. Use a ratio of long/short that fits your risk preference.|2022-03-09 08:55:20

zz428j|ta5dee|ta5dee|12|I'm feeling very confident that today will have a good entry price for AMZN calls. The sideways action since Monday morning has been good to bring down the pricing.  The chain I'm looking at is March 25. Really Amazon swing up and down pretty quickly so this might be overkill, but I would like a little more time to see a full reversal.  I was saying before to target 3200. I think that's still doable, but I'm actually going to price the options versus 3100. This is bringing in some good offerings. The best as of last night was AMZN 2980c, which at 3100 would be $120 intrinsic, giving a 7.6x against the cost of $12.08. These are the kinds of multipliers we are looking for.  That said, the AMZN 2875c gives a 6x potential, which is a pretty heavy possible return, absolutely worth flipping a coin on. And because of the lower strike, it has a lot more potential in profitability. So, given last night's numbers, I'd say to adjust between 2875c and 2980c based on your risk tolerance.  And, to be clear, these numbers are going to change in five minutes. So, what I'm planning to do is wait ten minutes or so, let the option prices settle, and then enter when I find it most advantageous. I only detailed the above so you could do the same without waiting on me.  Edit: So, something you'll see is that nighttime prices for options can be wonky and I feel like that was probably the case here. I don't think those close prices were realistic and right now that range is giving more like a 5x so I don't recommend entering there. But I still feel like  good 6-7x options will show up today, so keep your eye on it.  Edit: 42 AMZN 3/25 2980c filled at $18|2022-03-09 08:27:38

It was a good entry.  However, there's an aspect of this where the entire market could see a huge shift down because reasons likely to do with the war in ukraine. I don't anticipate this at all and in fact I feel the exact opposite is going to occur soon.  But just in case it does, it's always good to have a short position that can cover some of the losses if that does happen. Looking around, I decided to open a SHOP short position. I limited this to $17k because it's purpose really is to kick in and cover my losses. I put $75k into AMZN.  SHOP went up 9% today. Looking around, it wasn't really for any good reason, and stocktwits is full of hopium. It coming up lowered the price of the puts to where it's got a good chance of return, and this kind of blip up with no news easily gets erased in a few weeks. This is not an earnings play because expiry is well before April 27.  I went with 17 SHOP 470p 3/25 and it filled at $10. With a price target of 400, that's a 7x.|2022-03-09 10:38:40

zyjg41|ta5dee|ta5dee|7|Stay in cash gang bois!!!  Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping after having risen, this is the most reliable indicator signaling significant moves in the stock market. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. The s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now) Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.  AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.

And on another point, they need to sell everything on their balance sheet back into the markets as well - it needs to be at zero within a year.

zyu7li|ta5dee|ta5dee|7|An average wage earner has to work less than 5 minutes for a liter of gasoline, while an average wage earner in 1980 had to work about 16 minutes for a liter of gasoline. A 1980 VW Golf I had a consumption of 9 liters per 100 km, while a modern Gold VIII consumes only 4.5 liters per 100 km. This means that in 1980 100 km cost 144 minutes (2 hours 24 minutes) of working time, while today 100 km cost less than 20 minutes of working time.   Now someone is telling me something about high gas prices again. 🤡🤡🤡|2022-03-09 07:06:13

Imagine if Jesus prefaced everything he said with “as the son of God;” or if the president said, “as the president” before every opinion. It’s a declaratory statement that you are not permitted to disagree, or even have another opinion, due to the implicit authority in the preface. It also implies at some level that almost everyone else in the subgroup either thinks the same way or doesn’t think that way, leading to improper generalizations. Maybe just state your damn opinion without all the bullshit.|2022-03-09 05:52:18

Today MTCH is up 13% and my puts have gone from being close $2,000 in profit to $-703 in the red.  Every other single time I have tried to sell and the price moves against me I just constantly edit the price and select mid-point to get rid of them.

Retail thinks this is "buy the dip" without understanding that the market isn't tanking on some superficial fear.   Interest rates, oil, QE tapering, inflation, supply chain ... need I go on? I hope everyone buying right now HODLs all the way down when SPY kisses 250 this year.|2022-03-09 13:32:53

Here's some key takeaways I hope you got from today:  \- Speculating on commodities at all time highs is almost always going to lose you money.  \- Learn about the fucking market you're investing in before you do it, moron. How many of you idiots piled in to Wheat without realizing that the global Wheat trade is about 1% the size of the oil market? Who did you think was going to buy those massively inflated wheat contracts from you?  \- Governments don't tank their economies to put sanctions on a country. They will make sure they have a plan to make up that lost supply before capping themselves in the knee to teach someone a lesson.  Stick to GME conspiracy theories. You invented that market.|2022-03-09 12:41:45

The reason behind the delay was straightforward: demand is sufficient enough for the company to be supply constrained even without bringing to market new vehicles. This is an advantageous position, particularly considering the challenging global supply chain environment. If there's any year to avoid a new model with new parts, this is it. And Tesla can do it without hurting its delivery growth potential. Indeed, management indicated that it can actually grow faster if it delays its new vehicles.  "The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output," said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.|2022-03-09 11:24:25

00iqvc|ta5dee|ta5dee|1|Ms. Yellen, before proposing how best to regulate corn, can you demonstrate your understanding of how it works?   Perhaps start with a simple concept such as not needing banks and no one gives a fuck about it being backed by Gold or the USD. If you're feeling spry, maybe touch on the fact Uncle Sam can't freeze your fiat like Fuhrer Trudeau did to Canadians last month had they been using corn and hardware wallets. Perhaps also demonstrate your wisdom by providing your input on corn's hash rate correlation to price over time.
