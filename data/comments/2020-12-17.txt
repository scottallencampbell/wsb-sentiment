A few days ago he made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kcoozq/tifu_by_chugging_hot_sauce/) TIFU post to cover up not doing it by saying he got hospitalized and his phone broke so there is no proof.

But I chose to open a $26 call instead avg 0.50 or some shit   Had I followed my gut, this morning that $27 call could gave me $110k-$160k in return.

g4rw9r|kevfhc|kevfhc|15|Heads up, SKEW is jacked to the tits right now. The SKEW measures OTM put purchases on the SPX. Above 135 can indicate that hedge funds and institutional investors are hedging their long positions pretty heavily - there could be a potential pullback in the near future. For reference, the last time the SKEW hit these levels was 8/24. There was a strong rally for the next week and a half or so and then a 130 point drop in the SPX in a single day, and a 350 point drop over the next week and a half. It might happen, it might not. But with TSLA inclusion to the S&P happening, all these IPOs, and witching hour, it may be a good time to be cautious.|2020-12-17 05:25:44

If you want to make money off the earnings and steel price going up get you some 2/21 calls  Want it to breathe after earnings and think it’ll pop right back up in February after earnings due to the demand?? Get some 4/21 calls (what I have)   If you believe in this company whole heartedly and your cock is made of iron and Jupiter’s tears, then go 6/21 30c  MT is not to be taken lightly...|2020-12-17 11:26:11

g581io|kevfhc|kevfhc|3|Big buying out of the gate from steel crew on both VALE and MT. To all you thinking of getting on board, these two rarely make big flashy 30% daily gains (although MT did have a 10% day this week), but they are slow and steady gainers. Look at the one month and three month chart for each. Lots of room to go and time to hop on in my opinion. Not a pump And dump weekly play (unless you buy at the money maybe), But January and February are gonna be very nice I have a feeling. Im holding for a few months to watch the money steadily flow in.|2020-12-17 08:45:34

They have cash in pocket equal to its market cap, Ford credit makes it one of the top 10 banks, and options are cheaper than a mcChicken.

g545t2|kevfhc|kevfhc|7|*>Washington D.C., Dec. 17, 2020 —*  \>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robinhood Financial LLC for repeated misstatements that failed to disclose the firm’s receipt of payments from trading firms for routing customer orders to them, and with failing to satisfy its duty to seek the best reasonably available terms to execute customer orders.  Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle the charges.  \>According to the SEC’s order, between 2015 and late 2018, Robinhood made misleading statements and omissions in customer communications, including in FAQ pages on its website, about its largest revenue source when describing how it made money – namely, payments from trading firms in exchange for Robinhood sending its customer orders to those firms for execution, also known as “payment for order flow.”  As the SEC’s order finds, one of Robinhood’s selling points to customers was that trading was “commission free,” but due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers’ orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers’ prices.  Despite this, according to the SEC’s order, Robinhood falsely claimed in a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution quality matched or beat that of its competitors.  The order finds that Robinhood provided inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.  Robinhood made these false and misleading statements during the time in which it was growing rapidly.  \>“Robinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,” said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “Brokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.”  \>“Robinhood failed to seek to obtain the best reasonably available terms when executing customers’ orders, causing customers to lose tens of millions of dollars,” said Joseph Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit.  “Today’s action sends a clear message that the Commission will not allow brokers to ignore their obligations to customers.”  \>“There are many new companies seeking to harness the power of technology to provide alternative ways for people to invest their money,” added Erin E. Schneider, Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.  “But innovation does not negate responsibility under the federal securities laws.”  \>Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Robinhood agreed to a cease-and-desist order prohibiting it from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, censuring it, and requiring it to pay a $65 million civil penalty.  Robinhood also agreed to retain an independent consultant to review its policies and procedures relating to customer communications, payment for order flow, and best execution of customer orders, and to ensure that Robinhood is effectively following those policies and procedures.  \>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Warner and Ainsley Kerr of the Market Abuse Unit and Matthew Meyerhofer, Victor Hong, and Andrew Hefty of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The case was supervised by Steven Buchholz and Mr. Sansone of the Market Abuse Unit and Monique C. Winkler of the San Francisco Regional Office.  Examinations of Robinhood conducted by Michael Marren, Catherine Cotey, Michael Wells, David Kinsella, and John Broderson of the SEC’s Chicago Regional Office and Jerry Schoenborn, Shanti Radkar, Marcus Chan, and Stephanie Wilson of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office contributed to the investigation.  The SEC also acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.|2020-12-17 08:07:11

g69q52|kevfhc|kevfhc|3|FISKER AND MAGNA ENTER INTO DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS  We have entered into definitive “operational phase” platform-sharing and initial manufacturing agreements with Magna International Inc. (collectively with its affiliates, “Magna”), which clarify and finalize key aspects of the framework agreement previously announced on Oct. 15, 2020.  “I’m very pleased to have closed this definitive agreement, as planned, following the signing of the original framework deal,” commented Fisker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Henrik Fisker. “With the recent completion of the PPS gateway, the Fisker and Magna teams are working literally around the clock to ensure we can keep our rapid development program on track towards the delivery of the all-electric Fisker Ocean SUV, projected to commence in Q4 2022.”  The Fisker Ocean will initially be manufactured exclusively by Magna in Europe, where it currently produces several high-quality vehicles on behalf of global brands. Interest in the Ocean continues to build at an encouraging pace, with global paid reservations now standing at more than 10,400 as of today. Fisker plans to unveil a production-intent prototype of the Ocean in the summer of 2021.  “Our teams are fully engaged to enable the projected start of production in Q4 2022 and are working through a common set of program milestones,” said Frank Klein, president of Magna Steyr. “Our complete vehicle development approach is ideally suited to the Ocean program and its rapid development path to market.”|2020-12-17 13:54:37

g5sz6i|kevfhc|kevfhc|6|I read this about Tesla inclusion from some smart person:  >RobinHood and other retail "punters" have speculated in predominantly upside calls, magnifying the feedback loop of dealers chasing deltas as short gamma has made them shorter on the way up. Constant rolling of short term options by retail has created a feedback loop that has driven the stock higher and higher. Tesla reminds us partly of the tech/telecom bonanza in the late 1990's where hot stocks such as Nokia would trade an absolutely enormous size of options, feeding the move higher as short gamma traders had to chase both deltas and vols higher.  >Tomorrow the stock enters mighty S&P 500 with a big weight. It is great to be in the biggest index of them all, but can the options bonanza continue?  >As a big component of the index Tesla will now be part of an index where a massive amount of various structured products, dispersion trades, overwriting etc by big funds is part of every day flow. All these index "options dynamics" will most likely contribute to a new aspect of Tesla options.  >Just imagine the classical overwriting index strategy to fund downside protection. This results in big funds "flooding" dealers with upside call options, and leaving them short downside put protection. With a big weight in the index, Tesla will "feel" these dynamics as well.  >Tesla will "indirectly" be experiencing this supply of options people are not used to. Retail punters will soon start experiencing the concept of "theta bleed".   Index inclusion will destroy the IV for Tesla overtime basically.|2020-12-17 11:40:54

g6g9yd|kevfhc|kevfhc|2|Thoughts on Virgin Galactic (SPCE)  They're a space stock which means there's a lot of risk. (things blowing up, crashes, etc)  Because it's so risky there's a lot of volatility. This means that there will likely be a lot of good buying opportunities whenever the stock dips. But because it's a future oriented company with a lot of potential for ultra-fast long distance travel, people are going to happily invest in it regardless.  I could see SPCE be worth upwards of 100 Billion (purely speculation)  in 5-10 years if they can successfully have Proof of Concepts and then start generating revenue. But I'm sure they will have failures along the way which means their stock is going to continue to be volatile as the price average moves upwards.  My plan with SPCE is to buy the dips as it moves upwards.|2020-12-17 14:47:29

I honestly can see the exact same thing happening with ABNB. The only issue is the calls aren’t there yet. They only go out to mid 2021 and only go up to $160. That said I bought those the morning they became available and am up 60%. I realize the stock is expensive but I think a case can be made that it’s actually fairly valued right now, not overvalued, and that they are heading into a massive explosion in travel and bookings.|2020-12-17 08:29:34

g7vpee|kevfhc|kevfhc|2|I think I'm just gonna have to quit playing quickplay and just move to Arena only.   The game at least once every two hours the game pauses in the middle of a match and the game continues like normal afterwards, but still I get penalized for a "disconnect" even though I know that I'm not playing a CPU cause CPUs don't teabag.  The only solution I've found to this is to SD as quickly as possible because the game for whatever reason doesn't count it as a disconnect if I can get to the victory/defeat screen within 15 seconds.  I quit playing Smash entirely because of this issue, but Sephiroth brought me back. Maybe I'll have to change the ruleset. Shorter time and only 2 stocks. I think that would work too.|2020-12-17 22:21:08

g5pn41|kevfhc|kevfhc|2|Get this- I had an account full of Biitcoiin that traded with an automated trading system (bot) that was giving me a consistent 5-10% a month. So basically It was day trading stocks and currencies for a monthly profit and I just had to watch.   I was running it on a virtual machine and completely forgot about it. I had been running it since 2018... Well I just saw current price of biitcoiin and thought “holy shit.... that current price combined with 5-10% a month... I could quit my job after seeing this fucking number”   Well...... “License expired”. My virtual machine license expired in 2019 and I used an alternate email for it so I never got notified it was expiring. I believe I could be worth 6 figures right now had I renewed it. I’m instead worth 4 figures. Time to go cry in the corner|2020-12-17 11:14:09

When the pivot at 12450 was breached, the pattern was confirmed. The market provided one additional opportunity for an entry in Monday's post market as it retested 12450 which the pivot successfully held as support.  12680 target was reached in response to the FOMC announcement. And the 12755 overreach target all but reached in response to bludgeoning of Peasant Dollar in overnight trading.

g5v81c|kevfhc|kevfhc|1|I’m retarded, but could someone please help me understand why there is a discrepancy between my limit order price and the settlement value. For example, I buy 23 shares of a stock for $100.15 for a total price of $2,303.45. I then set a limit sell to sell at 102.11. The limit sell is triggered leading to the sale of my shares. Simple math tells me that my profit should be 23shares x 1.96 for a total profit of 45.08. However, my broker is telling me I only made roughly 25.08 on the trade.

g5xh5i|kevfhc|kevfhc|-8|I know wsb is a bad place about investing for retirement but I really don't understand the point of putting a ton of money in retirement early on. I'm 19 and during college, money is worth a lot more than your adult life since you're not making much and your dollar goes further. Plus most money you have is fun money since most expenses are already paid for. It would feel like a bad idea but I'm wondering if I should just pull half the amount from etrade and put it in my bank for the next few college years and not worry about working and take a couple frugal vacations. When you're retired you don't have the body to hike the national parks. As of now, I legit would rather die a few years earlier and have a good life rather than be bed ridden at a nursing home with or without a spouse. The amount of healthcare you need when you get older just doesn't seem worth it. Why save all throughout your adult life when youre gonna spend it on a nursing home rather than spending it throughout your life improving your daily life and having more experiences?

Getting EUA and full approval soon for Covid-19. Has $9b worth of product for 2021 already under contract to be manufactured which will sell out immediately. This isn’t including their HIV BLA, along with 10 other phase 2 applications in the pipeline including NASH, Alzheimer’s, 22 basket cancer trial that are linked to ccr5. This stock could very well 10x in the next year, possibly more. Bought in at .30, riding it to $100. They just finished final enrollment for their phase 3 covid trial, results will be mid January at the latest but more than likely approval before then because the drug IS SAFER THAN TYLENOL and reduced SAEs by 60 fucking % in their mild to moderate trial.

g4sll3|kevfhc|kevfhc|-19|I heard about the stock market and Robin hood is easy to download. What I don't know is that there's something about stocks, in here, and on other places, when people are talking about the stocks and when they go up, but usually when they have gone down people tend to say that the stock price or maybe the target price is supposed to be one of the things that when your talking about the stock markets, it's something you'll want to do or want to think about doing whether it's a good stock or bad stock because sometimes finding the right trade at the right time is one of the ways to do it.|2020-12-17 05:36:56
