Their server chips have completely killed Intel's. AMD is being used in the consoles now too...

ywl3pn|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|6|Today was a no-move day, sideways all day because tesla and msft earnings will dictate the sentiment of tech upon which everyone trades the rest of the week. It‚Äôll be very interesting to see what happens if tesla bears earnings. If they pop off their current highs of the last 3 mo that‚Äôs a huge shock and signifies a huge willingness to ratchet up risk through 2020. If they remain flat and merely fill their big shoes, the market will likely be pretty flat going forward and you can expect overall volatility of the markets to decrease substantially.   Either will be fun for the markets, it‚Äôs a return to normalcy or a continuance of the lunacy of 2020 valuations.

Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper. To trace the history of the most prominent of these delusions is the object of the present pages. Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.    >   >In the present state of civilization, society has often shown itself very prone to run a career of folly from the last-mentioned cases. This infatuation has seized upon whole nations in a most extraordinary manner. France, with her Mississippi madness, set the first great example, and was very soon imitated by England with her South Sea Bubble. At an earlier period, Holland made herself still more ridiculous in the eyes of the world, by the frenzy which came over her people for the love of Tulips.|2020-07-22 07:02:09

yvsp9j|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|9|How to do daytrade without 25k on TOS  ---> go to live chat customer support    Type: Hello, hope you are doing well today. I was wondering if you could be send me the cash account waiver so that I can daytrade without $25,000 in my account.  The cust. support agent will copy paste the waiver into the live chat or email it to you. For me, he copy pasted the waiver into live chat and asked me to type I agree as the next message if so.  Type: I agree   Sad part is now you gotta wait for a day or two for them to push over the new rules on your account, but you're  homebound from there..   You can only daytrade in one given day your total settled account value. Options settle overnight regardless of if you close the position or not. Shares can take up to 3 nights to settle so I dont recommend daytrading shares with this method.   For example, you start the day with $1000, buy a spy call at open for $200, and sell 30 minutes later for $250. Now you only have $800 of daytrading buying power until tomorrow.  I hope this can help you make money, I became a consident trader once I made this switch and could cut losses quickly/ secure profits daily  Edit: mad spelling errors, I dont get paid for people to sign up for TOS, nor do I have any active investments in AMTD|2020-07-22 10:55:27

Even if they beat but end up with a slight loss, TSLA will tank. A lot of its recent gains were from pricing in S&P500 inclusion.  Elon's smug attitude on Twitter right now leads me to believe they will come through with a surprise positive beat.

yvmwcu|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|8|I'm 100% invested in Tesla currently, 70% shares and 30% long expiration options. I felt pretty good after last night about Tesla going forward, but gotta say, I'm worried about how they are going to do today. In all honesty, I think we peak at 1660ish levels today if anything, otherwise we going sideways or nose diving. Just my opinion. Good luck Tesla position holders.|2020-07-22 10:07:32

Fred showed her his genealogy DNA test results.  No match for any of his relatives, and strong matches for a family who lived the other side of the city.  Perturbed, his mother called her husband. "Honey, Fred has done a DNA test, and... and... I don't know how to say this... he may not be our son."  "Well, obviously!" he replied.  "What do you mean?"  "It was your idea in the first place" her husband continued. "You remember, that first night in hospital when the baby did nothing but scream and cry and scream and cry. On and on. And you asked me to change him."  "I picked a good one I reckon. Ever so proud of Fred."|2020-07-22 10:23:39

ywpp36|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|7|MSFT reports $1.46 per share for Earnings. In Q4 2019, MSFT reported $1.51 per share for Earnings. In Q4, price per share was about $160, now it's around $210. If you're wondering how they can beat estimates and still be down, it's because they were expected to beat estimates by around $0.25 per share, but they only beat by $0.10.|2020-07-22 15:14:03

yv48fw|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|8|I wouldn‚Äôt recommend playing TSLA earnings. You need a 20-30% move and your gains will be minimal. IV crush will murder your account. Remember last week when NFLX had earnings? Their options were crazy expensive. You were spending 2-4K for one option that was 30-50 OTM. Now look at NFLX options... they‚Äôre priced lower and reasonable. This is what is going to happen to TSLA. So, even if you pick the correct direction of the stock you‚Äôll probably lose.  I usually just lurk here, but I would hope this comment saves a few people from YOLOing their account on TSLA. The people selling far OTM options are the real winners here.|2020-07-22 06:59:28

The share of adults who cannot afford to pay their monthly housing bill varies considerably from state to state, however.   Too bad. Boomers homes are going to drop 10-15% form what they are today come Q4  So sad  Poor boomers  > In Maine, 12.3% of adults missed a rent or mortgage payment in June, or are likely to miss the following month‚Äôs payment.

Despite the big jump (for TSM) The past few weeks, the IV is still low as hell on this stock and it has way more room to grow. Keep in mind they are also located in Taiwan, which has handled the corona better than anyone so impacts to production should be minimal compared to anywhere else in the world. Even if their customers are affected, there was always a line waiting for their turn because the demand is higher than their production capabilities.

ywbe59|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|2|My autism senses are tingling. Been debating between call/put debit spreads all day on MSFT and TSLA.  If both of them beat earnings, SPY will absolutely skyrocket.  If MSFT beats, but TSLA misses, SPY should still probably go up because TSLA isn‚Äôt part of it anyway.  If MSFT misses, but TSLA beats, wouldn‚Äôt SPY still go up due to the mere inclusion of TSLA in the S&P500?  The only way I see a major downside is if both completely miss.  Therefore, a MSFT call spread seems like the play. Thoughts?|2020-07-22 13:23:28

ywg7ba|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|1|So the market is in a holding pattern waiting to see what all these big tech earnings are going to say.   But here‚Äôs the conundrum.   So If the earnings are good we just continue upward because q2 was a write off and a not horrible q2 means that q3 will be better.   But if the earnings are bad and another sell off or leg down is triggered we already know another stimulus will be here by August and the fed has pledged to step in and keep the market afloat.   So literally stonks can only go up?|2020-07-22 14:00:54

yvg6p2|hvr7i6|hvr7i6|2|Here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt think some people understand about selling your options open.   It just gives the market makers a chance to sell all of the shares that they bought in order to Delta hedge. If you look at the order books you‚Äôll see that almost every single order most of the time is just 100 shares over and over and over again, and some of that is just people actually buying the stock in intervals of 100, but most of that is market makers buying and selling in order to Delta hedge the contract that they either wrote or bought back.  Point is people are either going to take profits or exit positions at open because they either made money or lost money and can‚Äôt stand the idea of losing more. Lots of people have toilet paper hands. Never ever ever sell or for that matter buy at open *unless* you know something is going to happen immediately at open for certain (see cybertruck).|2020-07-22 09:08:44
