Last 3 times it tried to break above this level it failed and went back down. It will almost certainly go back down this time and this is being priced into the puts.  Weekly calls are cheap AF right now. If this gaps up tomorrow a bunch of shorts betting on it going down will be wrong and have to close out their positions leading to a short squeeze.

i4jons|f69d94|f69d94|8|I have a theory. VW just announced it's ended all participation in gasoline powered racing. In case you're unaware, VW is huge, and has a massive influence over the automotive scene.  I have a feeling, as well as many others, that internal combustion engine (ICE) motorsports are going to take a pretty big hit from this. And if you're familiar with the car world, you know that racing has a huge impact on consumer cars in the form of new technologies. Much of the RND applied there makes it to us.  Without the world's largest automaker participating in ICE racing for the sake of greener appearances, I think other automakers will follow suit.  What this would potentially mean is the racing world transitioning into electric. A robust electric racing scene would translate into much faster, and more aggressive RND into electric. Better efficiency is key here to go more laps with less charge, aerodynamics improve efficiency, new ways of restoring energy in ways similar to regenerative braking, etc. These will eventually find their way into their consumer vehicles making electric better, and this more popular, faster.  The other big thing is, if people can see electric racecars outperforming their ICE counterparts, people who may not otherwise like the idea of electric will start to see the hype and arguments for electric.  All this to say, the VW announcement, in conjunction with things like Mercedes stopping further development of ICE vehicles, I think that electric is going to be showing up much faster than people originally thought.  the most important thing for electric to work is good infrastructure. That's the one weakness right now. So I say, start backing electric vehicle infrastructure.  I just bought up a large amount of BLNK (Blink Technologies) which is currently the only publicly traded electric vehicle charging infrastructure company. It's also the largest, boasting more charging stations and technologies than any other charging company.  So far, since the VW announcement, I'm up about 30%  Food for thought!     TL;DR Edit: I think VW's pulling out of electric vehicle racing is going to force electric vehicle adoption faster, urging other carmakers to follow suit, and electric vehicle infrastructure is the place to put your money. Give BLNK a look.|2020-02-19 14:02:16

When a fresh option is written, a dealer who sells it will typically hedge their exposure by buying a certain amount of the stock so as not to accumulate a short position, and will tend to buy more shares in the event of a continued rally. Some traders have seized onto this dynamic as evidence that their options-buying activity is sufficient to perpetuate a rally in the underlying stock.  Keep buying calls bois!|2020-02-19 05:49:04

i4fgb1|f69d94|f69d94|10|Here's some DD for you:  $SPCE has been on a crazy train run since the beginning of January.  The conference happening tomorrow AM \*\*BEFORE MARKET OPEN\*\* is a huge pump opportunity that Sir Branson is not going to waste - he wants to be a leader in space travel and this is his opportunity to PUMP IT UP. Earnings mean nothing for a new company that hasn't proven it's revenue stream, it's all hypothetical.  THIS IS YOUR WARNING NOW - STRAP ON YOUR HELMET AND PREPARE FOR BLASTOFF. THIS SPACESHIP IS NOT STOPPING FOR ANYONE ONCE IT GETS GOING!  (Look at trade volume and support on this thing, it's mind blowing. Easily jumps another 10%-20% pre-market tomorrow after Branson blows the ceiling off the news conference!)  Thank me for the tendies later!|2020-02-19 13:21:56

i3xt2o|f69d94|f69d94|2|NTR  Earnings were released yesterday and weren't great but this stock has  huge upside potential. The bears have been feasting on this stock and I  don't know why. It was created by the merger of Potash Corp and Agrium.  The company itself has been purchasing shares through a buy back as the  damn stock has fallen ( Buyback program up to 42 million shares). They  are the biggest player in the world of fertilizer. It is the largest  producer of potash and the third largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer  in the world. They have 30% of the worlds potash market (third number  on the miracle grow you feed your tomatoes) and they actively market it  along with Mosaic (9% of the market) the other largest producer in North  America through a cartel they call Canpotex to everyone outside North  America. Boomers love this stock pays a good dividend its also one you  would buy for your kids trust fund. Somebody please make a meme so  people learn about this stock and we can bend some Bears over the table.  Branson and Musk are going to need this to grown their food in space.|2020-02-19 10:31:41

i4564e|f69d94|f69d94|4|Lol I wasn't expecting to make 300/option on my naked short TSLA calls immediately but I'll take that lol.  Got it all from delta/vol too, not even theta.  TSLA's got this interesting delta-vol correlation unlike any other stock.  Upside vol drops when stock drops (so you lose on delta and vol when you are long calls, gain on delta and vol when short calls).  Usually it's the reverse for most stocks.  That's why people make so much when TSLA rockets up, since they win on delta, gamma, and vol.  I'm holding the 1040 short until Friday EOD though, so these short term moves really don't mean too much in the big picture.  Just need to avoid the +5-10% move overnight.  That's when TSLA realizes it's vol.|2020-02-19 11:43:08

i41n3i|f69d94|f69d94|1|If it makes anyone feel better, MSFT is actually "up" 0.5% and not 0.2% today (so around +0.90 instead of +0.40)...which is what it shows...but I bet like 90% of the people here don't know why that's the case, which is really bad if you have options on it.  Anyways, NFLX, FB, etc. are all down or close to 0%, so a lot of tech isn't really behaving that normally.  But if you are a long term call holder of MSFT, it shouldn't matter anyways.  You'll be fine, when has it ever let you down.  If you have like the weekly 190 calls but don't know why MSFT is actually supposed to be "up" 0.55% and not the listed 0.25%, then that's not good...|2020-02-19 11:09:12

i3jnbi|f69d94|f69d94|-1|Trigger Warning: This Post contains extreme autism and no DD at all.  &#x200B;  Anyone else getting superstitious about tomorrow? 2/20/2020 seems like a perfect wikipedia article entry for a bear correction like Dec 2018. Perhaps 10% - 15% by 3/20? Seems like a healthy place to correct and even with a 10% drop we'd still have a decent margin above 3000.   &#x200B;  "The S&P 500 began the day dipping to 3385 before a morning rally where the index topped out at 3400.00 before sliding through the close. The following Friday, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed 2% lower. The cause is generally accepted to be associated with fears surrounding global growth and coronavirus, though no one specific action can be pointed to as the beginning of the correction. The S&P 500 would find its bottom at 3065 in late March/Early April once fears associated with the virus subsided and sentiment returned to positive with the expectation of growth stabilizing."|2020-02-19 08:00:13

i3lfv3|f69d94|f69d94|-15|I'm really tired of Robinhood's bullshit but I really hate the idea of paying commission because I'm sorry but you are retarded if you don't understand that it's literally just a house advantage against your odds of making money. I'm thinking of switching to Lightspeed to have free stock trading and just pay the $0.60 on each of my options trades because even though it is a house advantage, it should remind me to only trade when I'm at a knowledge advantage big enough to make the $0.60 insignificant. I mean despite being barely over half a dollar that's still a big enough commission to stop me from ever making a retarded yolo 50/50 options play. Which sucks because I tend to have good luck with those. But it's kinda good because I have better luck with legitimately well thought out solid confident bets.
