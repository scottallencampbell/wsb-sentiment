I know at least 3 whiny boomers, two being members of my extended family that retired at 55, haven't had a mortgage payment in like 3 decades, put two kids through college without breaking a sweat, worked a brainless easy ass job with defined benefits pension packages with Healthcare insurance and still have the nerve to lecture the younger generations that are going to get saddled wit their debt sprees all so they don't have to endure even a few months of financial hardship.

mpblk9|fwim5b|fwim5b|17|Losses calls (formely called earnings calls) template that companies can use this year:  Good afternoon {COMPANY} shareholders, we have very exciting news to share with you regarding our cash flow from this last quarter.  As many of you know, 90% of our work force has been working from home, jiggling the mouse every 15 minutes to appear active in Microsoft Teams, while beating their dicks raw to porn and day drinking in their underwear for the past 45 days.  The remaining 10% of our work force has been designated as essential employees, and have been in the office compiling reports about which of these dick beaters will be the first that we let go upon the grand re-opening of the US economy.  Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\_PERCENTAGE}.  Thanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.  While we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.|2020-04-07 11:45:40

mpdueu|fwim5b|fwim5b|17|It's been a pretty ugly day so far for my puts, but I'm trying to capitalize on the movement.   I rolled my 4/24 $240p's, my 6/19 $220p's, and my 7/17 $205p's to 43 contracts of 5/15 $270p's. Got a fill at $12.35.  This pump back has been a bit ridiculous. The market can only ignore unemployment data for so long. The next monthly unemployment announcements from BLS come out on May 8, which I expect will be astronomical. Also, by this time, I expect that the end of social distancing will be pushed back to June.   The world's economy is entirely shut down, small business will start failing soon, we're going to be seeing Great Depression levels of unemployment, and things aren't going to get "back to normal" anywhere near what is being projected by the government right now.   TLDR: Taking my lumps, but I've rolled my losses into 43 contracts of 5/15 $270p's. If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but it's hard to envision this obscene price action continuing.|2020-04-07 12:04:30

mpsdhl|fwim5b|fwim5b|10|We’ll definitely hit a big red day at some point in the next few weeks, or maybe month. By June definitely. The virus will slow, which is why we’re so green right now.   Good virus news (if peak week is *now* that means we’re at peak, or at least that’s what the optimistic scenario is, that’s good news) and stimulus hopes.   We’re honestly probably going to see the next panic when things start opening up again. We’ll really see the full impact of how bad this fucked up the economy. Unemployment numbers are ignored right now because it’s a given.   If they stay high because companies can’t re-hire because of the financial hit they took + reduced demand, then that’s going to *freak* people out. Anyone who’s just trying to make a quick buck riding stock recovery and isn’t trying to hold long term will sell to avoid losing their gains. These two downward forces together will cause another panic.  That’s just my guess though. Right now I’m in oil calls.|2020-04-07 14:07:42

Also realized that the market isn't rational or makes sense. And it never seems to be affected by news. And is manipulated by jpows printer.

I get maybe it could be up if BIDU or BABA were up from that point (they aren't).

mpj9gg|fwim5b|fwim5b|13|If you own USO, today you are learning about contango.  Today USO started rolling over their futures contracts - which they do every month - and since WTI June is trading higher than WTI May - USO gets fewer contracts than they previously had.   So at these prices, for every 10 May contracts they sell, they are replaced with about 8.5 June contracts.   Think about it like this:   10 contracts x $40 = $400   8.5 contracts x $40 = $340  And every month oil is in contango this discrepancy will continue to add up and USO will fall further behind WTI increases.   Simply put, don’t hold USO for too long.|2020-04-07 12:50:34

mq46xc|fwim5b|fwim5b|11|I just scrolled the home page and I’m seeing the dumbest shit, so as a retard let me explain some shit.  “Some stocks are up 40 percent in 2 days!!!! Market rigged.”  Yeah so the way percentages work is that like when there’s a big number like 100 that goes down 80 percent to like 20, when it goes up 40 percent it’s not that big of a deal cause it’s a small number not a big number anymore.  Okay.  “CALL SEC WYNN is UP 21 percent!!!”  Yeah so the way percentages work is that like when there’s a big number like 100 that goes down 80 percent to like 20, when it goes up 40 percent it’s not that big of a deal cause it’s a small number not a big number anymore.  Do any of you retards even look at like the 3 month chart on stocks? Shit is down 80 percent and you talk about shorting.  Doesn’t matter if WYNN is fucking open, or BECKY can’t get her Starbucks right now, all that matters is she’ll get it sooner than later and at a cheap price even you can afford is too good to pass up.   Okay glad I could explain some entry-level retardation things.   OH!  USO tracks WTI CRUDE FUTURES. So you can stop posting “OMG SPY UP 3 percent WHY USO LAME GO UPPIE!” You can look at your bags all day long on WTI futures.|2020-04-07 15:49:14

mopvzv|fwim5b|fwim5b|4|Question about this bending the curve shit.   Even if the curve is bent, what exactly is stopping a resurgence?  What is preventing people from areas that haven't hit their apex or that evacuated NYC and will now come back from getting it and/or spreading it further and creating another outbreak?  There's still no vaccine or treatment.  We still don't have systems even remotely similar to China (temperature checks at every building and mode of transport multiple times and massive surveillance).     What exactly is the plan that is making people think we are remotely close to being back to normal?|2020-04-07 08:24:26

When businesses kick back into gear, isn't that kind of ironically when the pain actually starts to come? We pay more for imports, costs go way up, companies lose out, *actual,* non-virus layoffs have to happen, debt becomes unmanageable. Am I missing something here? Is the Brrr machine really just an Uno Reverse card that changes where the drop is to paradoxically when we actually start doing business again?

mpd8pl|fwim5b|fwim5b|5|On March 30th CVNA announced that it raised $600 million by selling 13.3 million shares to certain existing shareholders. That's not a bullish indicator because these are the same shareholders, including the founder and CEO, who have been dumping shares faster than the Fed is printing money ever since the stock went public 2017. The Company's operating losses get bigger every quarter. In Q4 the Company's operations burned $343 million. With just $76 million in cash at the end of Q4, CVNA would have hit the wall if that $600mm was not raised. There's no way the stock market would finance that deal in this market environment. I honestly believe that the insiders, who have made $100's of millions each off this stock, had to fund the $600 million or eventually face massive lawsuits. CVNA loses money, on average, on every unit vehicle it sells. At the current quarterly burn rate, which grows every quarter, that $600 million will be gone by year-end, if not sooner. Ironically, the burn rate will slow down if CVNA's unit sales decline, which is likel. There's also the issue of the subprime loans sitting on CVNA's balance sheet, waiting to be sold into auto loan asset-backed trusts. That ain't happening any time soon. But many of the borrowers connected to those loans are going to go delinquent or default outright. I've said in several past issues that this part of CVNA's balance sheet is a ticking time bomb.|2020-04-07 11:59:29

mot08k|fwim5b|fwim5b|11|Folks. We’ve ripped almost 30 points in 4 trading days.  New jobless claims Thursday. 6 million expected. EXPECTED! 16 million new claims in a month.  Uncertainty in OPEC deal and a potential sell the news event before long weekend.  Getting close to retracement/resistance levels.  Not saying we’re going back to lows (I think we are) but we’re at least heading towards people profit taking en masse.  If you’ve had calls, bravo. But look to take some profits or at least hedge with some weekly puts.  Your friend, a gay bear.  Edit: by the way my retracement level is 278. We hit resistance there, sell, if we close well above that level, I’ll even switch to bull gang.  Edit 2: I’m not a financial advisor. I press buttons on my phone like a monkey.

If I thought there was any way to stop the culling I would, but I am powerless. Unlimited QE needs to stop. But who's going to stop injecting smack if they have an unlimited supply.

mpgzc4|fwim5b|fwim5b|4|Congress & The Fed pumped $6 TRILLION into the economy.  That's 30% of our GDP.  It's very reasonable to believe stocks could go up 30% from lows, even with all of the other news being bad.  That puts SPY at $283.  It's kind of like inflation, but without affecting the actual inflation numbers, which only look at the cost of things like milk and bread.  Inflation of 30% hits the stock market instead of prices at the grocery store, due to the way the fed and congress printed the money.  As the Senate and Congress continue to work on stimulus bills 4 and 5, more money will be printed, which means stocks will continue to go up.|2020-04-07 12:31:02

mooke3|fwim5b|fwim5b|2|Disclaimer - I'm a "gay bull" or whatever that got in too early and a little too low on my strikes but honestly does anyone really believe if we go to 2900 that is an accurate representation of the status of the economy? While all the "bad news" had been priced in bringing us to 2200, I think the "good news" (economy reopening, oil deal being done, etc) is priced in on this bounce back at this point too. You have a lot of FOMO from investors that had cash on the sidelines jumping in because "I should have bought the dip, the market is coming back, I need to get in now, we are reopening for business" - It works till it doesn't. I'm sitting tight on my positions (I'm probably going to be down like 80%) until we see some sort of sell off/correction which I believe will be in the next 10 days or so. At that point I'm going to exit and re position.|2020-04-07 08:09:20

mpmxry|fwim5b|fwim5b|0|Hey fellow autist.  I've been subbed to this wsb for over two years now, which made me realize that there is a gap here. My team is considering building an option companion app which would help people understand what they are doing with options before buying them.  I have a 6 question survey which should only take a minute to fill out. If you could answer it, I'd greatly appreciate it.

mq2jtz|fwim5b|fwim5b|-6|I have obtained critical, new information about the ongoing crisis. You’ll want to read this...  MAJOR UPDATE  Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  So as everyone knows, unless you live under a bridge, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.  But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Stock markets across the globe are in turmoil. People don’t know what to do with themselves.  Well, I bring good news.  In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.  The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.  This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA  In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....  Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....  Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason   I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you’ll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it’s about to get crazy   The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.   “Ok, I’ll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren’t available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.”  The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.  They proceed to follow Bart’s plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious “boss”.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don’t need to worry about that andn I don’t need to explain it....  But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.  America’s passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.  I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you’ve earned it.|2020-04-07 15:35:07

moviqk|fwim5b|fwim5b|-2|Lol, I was called out for calling out the bs in a post 2 weeks ago that predicted 1m cases in the US by now. Hope those guys lost everything on their puts.  Edit: Holy shit it's still going on?   To clarify, the predictions were made based on CONFIRMED cases and trajectories. Like the US was just going to go exponential for ever, after ALL other countries saw short exp growth, then linear, then flattening...  I tried to tell people back then that it was going to rally and it's not as bad as people think, but this sub still seems to hang on to the deceptive unemployment charts the news put out, and the "dark" number of infected people, while blissfully ignoring that, if we actually have a lot more infected than we think, that would be major bullish news, as it would pull the virus down to flu level.|2020-04-07 09:21:39

Anyone else following Q heavily and trying to deduce market effects?     Serious replies only. If you think Q is trolling then f off and don't comment.

mplq5j|fwim5b|fwim5b|-14|MAJOR UPDATE  Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.  But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. People don’t know what to do with themselves.  Well, I bring good news.  In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.  The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.  This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA  In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....  Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....  Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason   I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you’ll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it’s about to get crazy   The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.   “Ok, I’ll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren’t available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.”  The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.  They proceed to follow Bart’s plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious “boss”.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don’t need to worry about that andn I don’t need to explain it....  But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.  America’s passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.  I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you’ve earned it.|2020-04-07 13:11:14
