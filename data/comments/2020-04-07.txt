mpblk9|fwim5b|fwim5b|17|Losses calls (formely called earnings calls) template that companies can use this year:  Good afternoon {COMPANY} shareholders, we have very exciting news to share with you regarding our cash flow from this last quarter.  As many of you know, 90% of our work force has been working from home, jiggling the mouse every 15 minutes to appear active in Microsoft Teams, while beating their dicks raw to porn and day drinking in their underwear for the past 45 days.  The remaining 10% of our work force has been designated as essential employees, and have been in the office compiling reports about which of these dick beaters will be the first that we let go upon the grand re-opening of the US economy.  Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\_PERCENTAGE}.  Thanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.  While we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.|2020-04-07 11:45:40

mpdueu|fwim5b|fwim5b|17|It's been a pretty ugly day so far for my puts, but I'm trying to capitalize on the movement.   I rolled my 4/24 $240p's, my 6/19 $220p's, and my 7/17 $205p's to 43 contracts of 5/15 $270p's. Got a fill at $12.35.  This pump back has been a bit ridiculous. The market can only ignore unemployment data for so long. The next monthly unemployment announcements from BLS come out on May 8, which I expect will be astronomical. Also, by this time, I expect that the end of social distancing will be pushed back to June.   The world's economy is entirely shut down, small business will start failing soon, we're going to be seeing Great Depression levels of unemployment, and things aren't going to get "back to normal" anywhere near what is being projected by the government right now.   TLDR: Taking my lumps, but I've rolled my losses into 43 contracts of 5/15 $270p's. If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but it's hard to envision this obscene price action continuing.|2020-04-07 12:04:30

mpj9gg|fwim5b|fwim5b|13|If you own USO, today you are learning about contango.  Today USO started rolling over their futures contracts - which they do every month - and since WTI June is trading higher than WTI May - USO gets fewer contracts than they previously had.   So at these prices, for every 10 May contracts they sell, they are replaced with about 8.5 June contracts.   Think about it like this:   10 contracts x $40 = $400   8.5 contracts x $40 = $340  And every month oil is in contango this discrepancy will continue to add up and USO will fall further behind WTI increases.

mpd8pl|fwim5b|fwim5b|5|On March 30th CVNA announced that it raised $600 million by selling 13.3 million shares to certain existing shareholders. That's not a bullish indicator because these are the same shareholders, including the founder and CEO, who have been dumping shares faster than the Fed is printing money ever since the stock went public 2017. The Company's operating losses get bigger every quarter. In Q4 the Company's operations burned $343 million. With just $76 million in cash at the end of Q4, CVNA would have hit the wall if that $600mm was not raised. There's no way the stock market would finance that deal in this market environment. I honestly believe that the insiders, who have made $100's of millions each off this stock, had to fund the $600 million or eventually face massive lawsuits. CVNA loses money, on average, on every unit vehicle it sells. At the current quarterly burn rate, which grows every quarter, that $600 million will be gone by year-end, if not sooner. Ironically, the burn rate will slow down if CVNA's unit sales decline, which is likel. There's also the issue of the subprime loans sitting on CVNA's balance sheet, waiting to be sold into auto loan asset-backed trusts. That ain't happening any time soon. But many of the borrowers connected to those loans are going to go delinquent or default outright.

mot08k|fwim5b|fwim5b|11|Folks. We‚Äôve ripped almost 30 points in 4 trading days.  New jobless claims Thursday. 6 million expected. EXPECTED! 16 million new claims in a month.  Uncertainty in OPEC deal and a potential sell the news event before long weekend.  Getting close to retracement/resistance levels.  Not saying we‚Äôre going back to lows (I think we are) but we‚Äôre at least heading towards people profit taking en masse.  If you‚Äôve had calls, bravo. But look to take some profits or at least hedge with some weekly puts.  Your friend, a gay bear.  Edit: by the way my retracement level is 278. We hit resistance there, sell, if we close well above that level, I‚Äôll even switch to bull gang.  Edit 2: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. I press buttons on my phone like a monkey. But I have a cool Fibonacci retracement function that shows me lines and makes me feel smart|2020-04-07 08:57:31

mokk8b|fwim5b|fwim5b|8|I always wondered. Of all the time in the universe why exist now, during this time frame. While sitting on the toilet reading all this bear vs bull rhetoric the answer finally dawned on me...  We will never be freer than when all this began. The virus was the first steps towards altering society forever. What we are seeing is the reaping of America and the rest of the truly free nations.  If I thought there was any way to stop the culling I would, but I am powerless. Unlimited QE needs to stop. But who's going to stop injecting smack if they have an unlimited supply.  I just take solace that I was fortunate enough to live in such a free and glorious society. And even more greatful not have subjected any progeny the hell that awaits society.

All the indicators still point to bear market rally. Rally on low volume + increasing VIX is not a good sign of healthy market.

mpgzc4|fwim5b|fwim5b|4|Congress & The Fed pumped $6 TRILLION into the economy.  That's 30% of our GDP.  It's very reasonable to believe stocks could go up 30% from lows, even with all of the other news being bad.  That puts SPY at $283.  It's kind of like inflation, but without affecting the actual inflation numbers, which only look at the cost of things like milk and bread.  Inflation of 30% hits the stock market instead of prices at the grocery store, due to the way the fed and congress printed the money.  As the Senate and Congress continue to work on stimulus bills 4 and 5, more money will be printed, which means stocks will continue to go up.|2020-04-07 12:31:02

You have a lot of FOMO from investors that had cash on the sidelines jumping in because "I should have bought the dip, the market is coming back, I need to get in now, we are reopening for business" - It works till it doesn't.

mq2jtz|fwim5b|fwim5b|-6|I have obtained critical, new information about the ongoing crisis. You‚Äôll want to read this...  MAJOR UPDATE  Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  So as everyone knows, unless you live under a bridge, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.  But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Stock markets across the globe are in turmoil. People don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves.  Well, I bring good news.  In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.  The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.  This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA  In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....  Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....  Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason   I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you‚Äôll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it‚Äôs about to get crazy   The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.   ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren‚Äôt available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.‚Äù  The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.  They proceed to follow Bart‚Äôs plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious ‚Äúboss‚Äù.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don‚Äôt need to worry about that andn I don‚Äôt need to explain it....  But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.  America‚Äôs passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.  I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you‚Äôve earned it.|2020-04-07 15:35:07

momlk9|fwim5b|fwim5b|-14|When Easter happens and QAnon conspiracy proves to be right I believe we will rally PAST ATH's next week. The days are being counted down now. Matter of time. It was all symbolic... "have the churches filled by Easter" - the fact that Easter is the day chosen for this to happen at all (Light/Truth wins aka Jesus rises). Anyone else following Q heavily and trying to deduce market effects?     Serious replies only. If you think Q is trolling then f off and don't comment. This is very real beyond a shadow of a doubt at this point and just like I saw the virus coming in early Jan and made bank off of puts I will be here saying "I told you so" again except next week when the Cabal falls and my calls fuckin print my eyes off.|2020-04-07 07:45:20

They may rocket to a crazy inflated amount if they release positive results.  That being said, they were already a hair overpriced and remdesivir is not a sure thing by any means. But it's a decent bet and you can brag if you were right. I'd do some 5/15 $85c|2020-04-07 12:36:12

mplq5j|fwim5b|fwim5b|-14|MAJOR UPDATE  Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.  But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. People don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves.  Well, I bring good news.  In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.  The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.  This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA  In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....  Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....  Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason   I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you‚Äôll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it‚Äôs about to get crazy   The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.   ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren‚Äôt available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.‚Äù  The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.  They proceed to follow Bart‚Äôs plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious ‚Äúboss‚Äù.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don‚Äôt need to worry about that andn I don‚Äôt need to explain it....  But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.  America‚Äôs passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.  I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you‚Äôve earned it.|2020-04-07 13:11:14
