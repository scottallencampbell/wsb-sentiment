zvc85t|t9edao|t9edao|7|Make sure you take profit on oil positions over the next few weeks.  If oil goes vertical past $150, we'd be looking at severe demand destruction across Europe and the US, and likely recession by the middle of the year in Europe with a negative quarter or two of growth in the US as well...  Which means oil probably would tank back below $80-90 by end of the year as the mid-year recession causes massive demand destruction.  Oil spikes are their own worst enemy...; every major spike in oil historically caused demand destruction and then tanked the price of oil.|2022-03-08 12:39:53

zvlmo8|t9edao|t9edao|27|Market makers playbook.  1. Dump -1.5% at open = bears receive confirmation bias that the world is going to crash and hold onto their puts. Bulls panic sell at bottom because they think -1.5% will turn into -3%.  2. Pump + 3.5% reversal = bears can't believe their eyes and how retarded they were to not take profit - suddenly war is cancelled - Ukraine won't join NATO - they all panic sell at a big loss or zero. Bulls that held on think that the recovery is back on and hold onto their positions.  3. Dump - Market makers dump it back down 2.5% - bulls that held on panic sell thinking that the world is actually going to world war 3 and they hit themselves for not taking profits - Bears load up on puts just as the index goes red thinking it will continue to crash (how couldn't they after it just dumped 2.5% in 40 minutes).  4. Pump - Market makers have now destroyed both bulls and bears in the span of a few hours. Bears opened new put positions seeing such a big reversal so market makers pump it back up. Bears suddenly re-think that world war 3 is cancelled and watch the index go back up 1.5% in 30 minutes - they panic sell their positions and watch as their portfolio goes to complete shit and wonder how and why..  5. The final Market Maker play - Dump into the close. With every day trader dead they don't want to give the bulls any profits so they do a final dump into the close to make the index close near 0% -- everyone gets equally fucked and they count all the money they made.   This ladies and gentlemen is the story of market makers and the algorithms that run them and a lesson in retard retail trader thinking and why 95% of us lose money day trading over the long term.|2022-03-08 13:36:44

Russia takes Kiev or Mariupol by the weekend and the NATO thing was just to buy time and hope they don't just rush in bombing everything.

zuhqgo|t9edao|t9edao|18|the crazy thing is people don't understand saudi has no spare capacity. my friend in O&G engineering tells me the Saudis have been ordering specialized pumps used only if fields are in terminal decline.      Oil demand are up 10% than pre-covid. Supply is about 20% lower with no way to ramp up. Frackers can't find casings/pipes, fucking sand is on a 3 month backlog due to rail backlogs, they are hiring people outside of prisons to be roughnecks and companies are stealing each other's frack crews. Even if every single O&G company is committed to massive capex expansion, which none of them are, it would take 12 months to get a rig going at max capacity.   Oil is a super inelastic commodity, meaning small changes to demand/supply will drive prices up by a factor of 10-20x the change in demand/supply. Well we have a 10% increase in demand, and a 20% decline in supply and no way to ramp up. Oil will go well into the 300s.|2022-03-08 09:28:43

Oil is still mooning and now we're banning russian oil so this will get worse 3. Fed is still hiking rates, yes .25 instead of .5 initially but this is actually not good as it just increases the risk of stagflation 4. Europe's energy prices are a lot higher than ours and they may actually spiral into a recession 5.

I've been keeping an eye on this and figured we could threaten that support today.

zvoram|t9edao|t9edao|4|While I'm bearish on the markets, the dip buyers have shown that they like to rise it into close, almost to make a point. I think that in about 40 minutes we'll see that rally into close. It's looking to me like this next round of dip-buying is going to accelerate. It's stupid in this economy. But the Fed printed so much money and gave it to America's upper middle class and rich, and they have so much cash that's just sitting in the bank that when they see the S&P get to about 4,200, they think stonks only go up so they buy around here.  This is going to continue until all those "printed" dollars from the past 2 years are all spent.  Sorry fellow ~~bulls~~ bears, but I think that if the market has held up over 4,220 up to this point today, this is only going to encourage the bulls to spend that Fed stimulus (the stimmy the mainstream doesn't talk about) over the next hour.  My puts are hurting, but tomorrow may be a better dip.  Watch what happens in the last 30 minutes. Some fuckers like to pull this crap at the end of the day during uncertainties, which I think is dumb, but they do it anyway. They're permabulls.|2022-03-08 13:56:15

We are in a global recession and inflation is bad. Not gonna lie, things aren't look great. But at the end of the day, we will still be able to put food on the table and still able to put gas in your car. The U.S. produces a shit load of grain, meat, and have the ability to drill for oil. We will be fine.  On the other hand, there are going to be a massive number of Russians who cannot import any foreign goods, who's currency has basically no value, and will just be hoping that they will be able to buy a loaf of bread at the store and have clean water to drink. Thinking that the U.S. populace is going to be worse off than the Russian populace is completely asinine.

Key 4D Chess takeaway from the article:   > Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak **threatened to cut off gas supply to Europe** if governments sanction energy imports, **warning that it could lead to oil prices surging above $300 a barrel.**   When no one wants to negotiate with you:   1. Start a war that if you win   2. Will allow you to corner 70% of neon, a third of the world’s supply of palladium (both critical infrastructure materials as they are required for chip manufacturing), and ~40% of the world’s wheat.   3. Take control of the pipes that supply energy to Europe and threaten to shut them off.   4. ????   5. Profit   Edit: this has r/agedlikemilk|2022-03-08 05:14:30

zuole1|t9edao|t9edao|1|I rolled last weeks XLE calls to the ones expiring March18. I am up over 100% on the calls again. are any of these options, good strategy? Open to any and all other moves:  1. let the calls expire ITM, sell the underlying after assignment or keep underlying.   2. roll the calls again to next week.   3. take profit from the calls, DCA into something like $SCO. the thinking is oil/energy is going to get sorted out sooner than later bringing oil/energy prices back to reasonable levels.   Thank you in advance.|2022-03-08 10:14:18
