If you missed out on gains, here's an idea:  Take note of huge MOO (market on open orders) that dislocated prices across the board, tanked certain stocks (e.g. stay at home winners) and raised others.  Some of those prices reversed and some are trading in the same direction. It'll give you ideas and opportunities. You might see a similar thing with huge MOC imbalances.

This is like a video game, people think a perfect cure will be released in a month 2. Barely anyone will have access to the vaccine for months 3. It is not a guarantee of immunity (might have to take another shot a year later)  4.  ANY issues with the vaccine (side effects, deaths) will be amplified because of media, and the probability of defects is high considering the short trial period 5. People assume economy will re-open as soon as vaccine is released 6. People also assume that,  if majority of population is vaccinated, all business and consumer activity will be restored to baseline. I think this lockdown has permanently damaged our sociological ecosystem and that we wont recover for a LONG time  Airlines being up massively is a sign of investor disillusion; for airlines to recoup their losses and restore to normal business without MASSIVE subsidies, it would take 5-10 years. So youre going to tell me all of a sudden today, people went long on airlines because they believe the vaccine will have an impact on the industry, even in 5-10 years?   Vaccine is no longer an economic cure, and considering the risks with it, i think this is a giant vaccine bubble lol.|2020-11-09 10:15:57

Pfizer will monitor volunteers for two months after getting their second dose before seeking emergency use authorization from the FDA...  \*\*(CNN)\*\*Drugmaker Pfizer said Monday an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine shows it is more than 90% effective -- a much better than expected efficacy **if the trend continues**.  The so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses of the vaccine or a placebo. It found that fewer than 10% of infections were in participants who had been given the vaccine. More than 90% of the cases were in people who had been given a placebo.  Pfizer said that the vaccine provided protection seven days after the second dose and 28 days after the initial dose of the vaccine. The final goal of the trial is to reach 164 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection.  **In a news release, the pharmaceutical giant said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months after getting their second dose of vaccine,** [**as requested by the FDA**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/health/fda-covid-vaccine-safety-data-bn/index.html)**." -** [MorrisseysRubiksCube](https://www.reddit.com/user/MorrisseysRubiksCube/)|2020-11-09 07:02:04

Basically now introducing a stimulus with a vaccine causes more bang for their buck. Amplifies the effect a vaccine has on the economy (and the market.)  2.) A vaccine reduces the $ amount needed for a stimulus to be effective for the economy, so more fiscally responsible minded members of Congress will be able to more comfortably get on board with one.|2020-11-09 09:28:35

bquss2|jqv478|jqv478|7|GME friends.  Gaming stocks are down across the board today.  GME is heavily shorted so it swings harder both ways.  I'm holding 13 different types of call options dating between Nov20 and April with a majority in Jan/April. At this point I'm only adding April calls to be safe (this is about half of my portfolio).  Strongly suggest that you not buy calls expiring before earnings  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Covid is not going away, vaccine won't be widespread for months or even a year+.  We are entering winter and the holidays.  Console cycle is starting up this week. Demand is insane, GME is going to be reselling used consoles for new price, despite paying 30-50% for them  Earnings coming up with forward guidance likely, and console sales/presales discussed  Large order volume and google searches for GameStop are way up.

The reality is, states are legalizing. Desire to waste money on prohibition is dwindling. The market for weed is coming, but it takes time. Long dated calls on CRON/CGC/APHA/MO.

Biden is telling us that the vaccine will not be ready in time and sharing a nebulous plan.   I think the virus can only be controlled in two ways.  1-Shutdown the country and destroy many more lives and the economy in the process  2-Get a vaccine to everyone that is willing to take it so we can begin to develop herd immunity  Regardless of who you voted for, I think most Americans would prefer to reopen as we have and continue to try and get on with life as we get the vaccine to everyone.   Neither president makes a difference here unless they are willing to provide more stimulus.  That is the one thing that they are not talking about in the plan.  Stop with the fucken masks already.  We are wearing them.    GET MONEY to the people that need it because they are starting to default on their mortgages and losing their businesses.|2020-11-09 11:06:07

bppvgf|jqv478|jqv478|5|[Proceed with at least some caution](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-effective/index.html). Pfizer will monitor volunteers for two months after getting their second dose before seeking emergency use authorization from the FDA...   **(CNN)**Drugmaker Pfizer said Monday an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine shows it is more than 90% effective -- a much better than expected efficacy **if the trend continues**.  The so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses of the vaccine or a placebo. It found that fewer than 10% of infections were in participants who had been given the vaccine. More than 90% of the cases were in people who had been given a placebo.  Pfizer said that the vaccine provided protection seven days after the second dose and 28 days after the initial dose of the vaccine. The final goal of the trial is to reach 164 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection.  **In a news release, the pharmaceutical giant said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months after getting their second dose of vaccine,** [**as requested by the FDA**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/health/fda-covid-vaccine-safety-data-bn/index.html)**.**|2020-11-09 06:54:31

bqzfxw|jqv478|jqv478|5|ZOOM selloff is stupid. One, many enterprise customers are on recurring subscription + usage based fee model. Once such contracts are signed, you are locked into those terms for a period of time. You can't just quit and cancel the contract the way you would cancel a Netflix subscription. So Zoom is not losing revenue from the enterprise customers and that's what matters.  Second, many businesses are changing. They figured out that employees can work remotely and employees dont have to travel. They can conduct meetings online. It saves businesses money (and for the next year at least, businesses are going to control the cost and normally, they are looking to control OPEX even in a good year). So online meetings are not going away. If anything, the long term trend will be more online meetings and much slower return to actual travels. Some businesses cant avoid travel (i.e. sales, etc) but most other businesses will now shift to online meetings.|2020-11-09 13:37:16

bpol3n|jqv478|jqv478|3|Disclaimer, I have puts though I acknowledge they are probably fucked.  The vaccine pump here seems like an overreaction. It is still months before it could get approved, and even then they said they will only have 10-20 million doses. Further, apparently the type of vaccine is unique and it has to be kept super cold in specialized containers making its distribution much more difficult, and requires people to get a second dose 3 weeks from the first. While the vaccine news is undoubted good, it‚Äôs not quite as game changing as the market is making it seem.|2020-11-09 06:37:37
