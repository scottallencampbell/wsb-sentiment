pjn8m2|gdv4qs|gdv4qs|87|TL;DR - Today I will get baked, sit on cash and ignore the market because I have no idea WTF is going on.  Back in January, I was non-ironically holding a shitload of:  MSFT 185 05/15 calls  AMD 60 05/15 calls  AAPL 320 05/15 calls  I wanted to hold up until Q1 earnings and my target was to sell when I was a few points ITM. I bought them back when J Pow first started the repo action. Back then "not QE" was slated to continue through April.  I literally had an entry price and exit price written down and limit orders set. My options were about 6 months out when I bought them. IV was at historic lows. It was an amazing time to go long on options and was a "can't go tits up" play.  I sold them when the market first started to drop for about 30% loss.  It's fucking amazing to me that after the biggest drop EVER these could have still been ITM and even profitable....  Edit: I was going to sit out today. I bought SHOP puts instead.|2020-05-05 05:33:03

This zombie market is on life-support of [govt ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-GOVT/)dope, err, dole. If the supply stops, it pops like a bubble.     It would [serve ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BIST-SERVE/)Trump's staff well to talk about printing more and keep the COVID "threat" alive. It does not matter what they do in the background. If Trump wants to get re-elected, this market better stay way above his 216 "Trump line". To do that, he will have to bend over backwards. Dems will get whatever pork they want and then both will bicker on TV on who did more for God and country come election time.     With such low [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/volume/) , the 5 min "crash" today at this Pence news will start the phones ringing at the white house. We should expect some noise from Tweetie Trump but the damage has perhaps been done. Market is now nervous about what these clowns will do next. I would be careful with longs here till the time CARES-2 is announced.     Caveat Emptor and good luck!|2020-05-05 14:47:46

pjvub1|gdv4qs|gdv4qs|6|Contrary to the 'just print more money 4Head' talk, there likely is a finite number, beyond which monetary expansion does cause a slow permanent increase in inflation % and fall in the value of the $.  That number would need to include the total amount of current and immediate future $ denominated debt of the rest of the world + value destruction from international trade moving away from the US$ to individual currencies (or more likely a basket of USD + Euro + RMB + JPY + Pound) + value of foreign owned american treasuries  As I think about this, even in today's uncertainty; the potential pain for the rest of the world moving away from the US$ as a reserve currency seems too high.  King dollar will likely always remain king dollar.  For this reason, we might never pay the Trillions in debt, but we will likely move to reduce the value of our debt by:  1) Having an avg rate of growth > growth of debt  2) inflation  3) Over a period of time, partly due to the depreciation in currency, having a tolerence for higher debt to gdp.  50 years from now, 10 to 1 ratio for debt to gdp might be perfectly acceptable.  We will never pay the debt, we can only hope to outgrow it and increase our risk tolerence.|2020-05-05 07:39:03

Based on what? mofos r using a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù 10% annualized growth? These guys love using the example of showing 10% compounded year over year to show how powerful time is. Well guess what, the market doesn‚Äôt go up every year and when u lose 50% in a year it takes a 100% to make it back. Seriously majority of corporate mules don‚Äôt realize this..   Fuk these guys locking up ppls funds for decades and prob selling fds to ppl in this sub. And guess what most ppl r soooo glad about their results and tell other ppl the 401k really works cuz look their money grew! But if they spent a couple months to self educate they could make at least double that by 60.. ‚ÄúOhhh but tax deferral, employer match and safety net..‚Äù fuk that if u got a brain u can make something more of ur own money rather than pay investment fees for a brain dead monkey rebalancing ur portfolio.

pkbn73|gdv4qs|gdv4qs|0|So I jumped into atvi today 5/8 68c at 2.03. Rode it up and when it was around 2.42 starting getting greedy but also remembered how I always get burned.   Sold a 70c for 1.50. So my break even is now 68.53.   Let‚Äôs say it drops like a rock tomorrow. IV should spike and I should be able to sell the spread and walk with a profit.   If it hits on earnings, it‚Äôs going to rocket up, but because it‚Äôs close to expiration, I should get the upside to 70, right?  So I basically locked my profit for today, out of day trades. But should get most of the gain.   Right? Thanks|2020-05-05 10:15:16

pljopp|gdv4qs|gdv4qs|-7|Futures traders: do you ever go long/short the underlying to effectively close out your contracts? Is that a thing?  i.e. - I'm long 1x /ES contract but I forgot that the there is a trading halt for /ES between 2pm PST - 3PM and I want to take profits before then. Would it make sense to short 50x SPY to effectively close out?|2020-05-05 16:25:21
