The administration halted the loan until the SEC confirms no wrongdoing on behalf of Kodak, and the Kodak board hired a law firm to review the situation ahead of/in parallel with the SEC's investigation, and now today the law firm, hired by Kodak to research and paint a good picture, claims what they did fell through flimsy corporate policy gaps but wasn't illegal, but the loan is still halted and the investigation hasn't stated anything yet, and that's why it's up 50% today.

5gql0y|itspun|itspun|2|Ok here is my quick TA on SNOW. It has data warehousing/analytics solution is geared primarily towards cloud and is scalable & easy setup. Where as TeraData the industry leader is struggling with offering a comparable cloud solution.  However TeraData is worth only 3 billion and revenues have stagnated at 4 bill/yr. Snowflake has 1/5th revenue and is worth 30 bill? It will also struggle to grow once it reaches TDC size (if it can even get there see below) as Datawarehouse spending among enterprises hasn‚Äôt increased much unlike CDN.  It faces heavy competition from Amazons own solution redshift. So I am bearish long term for this stock maybe a decent stock to ride the wave and dump before it crashes.|2020-09-16 07:29:57

It gets similar returns to big tech names but it doesn't have the downsides of tech such as the flash 10% crashes once a month. Options volumes are low so unless we can get this whole sub to pump them up I would recommend holding some shares so when your FDs are down 50% you at least have something bringing consistent growth in.
