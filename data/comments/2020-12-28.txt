Trying to get pytorch/cuda to compile for an old 780ti so I can stick ingest script for [the stats panel](http://wsb.gold/public/dashboard/5aaaf624-7563-4c89-9f69-a91cc069acc2) on a server in the basement. Not looking good so far. Wish me luck.|2020-12-28 08:04:55

It will eventually acquire a board seat with a monitor and it will choose a face to display   TLDR: Get PLTR shares before PLTR itself gets them!!!!|2020-12-28 13:49:40

Pleasure is always before us; but misfortune is at our side, while running after that, this arrests us. The most effectual means of being secure against pain is to retire within ourselves, and to suffice for our own happiness.  T.J.  Paris Octob. 12. 1786|2020-12-28 13:39:37

hbpm25|klohcs|klohcs|12|Alright boys, this autistic accountant is signing off. sold all my positions this morning as tax season is starting in a few weeks and I need a break before it begins. I am too retarded and can't not obsessively watch my positions, so a few month break is the best idea. Cash gang until April 15th, hoping for a juicy dip at some point to buy back in. 2020 brought me 40% gains and a lot of fun, not good enough for a gains porn post but I am happy with it. Had a few close calls to valhalla and also a few close calls with utter shambles.  Ill be judging all yall Robinhood brokerage statements; gotta self prepare if you don't want the shame. I will know exactly who bought Nikola at $90 and Kodak at $60 and I will be sharing this info here.|2020-12-28 15:09:00
hbmn42|klohcs|klohcs|26|**How to slay pussy on easy mode:   1.Have td ameritrade paper trading account open on your phone and make sure you edit it so it shows a balance of like $5 million (or anything you want but don't make it too obvious). I'll admit sometimes if they really hot i make my balance like $100million.   2. Walk up to them and ask them to take a picture with your phone but leave paper trading account open. She will proceed to see your account balance while trying to take a photo.   3. Then make it was mistake sayings "oopsie, how embarrassing....im a professional stock man forgot to close it after selling $1 million worth apple shares."   4. Watch their eyes to make sure they realize what is going on. That how you know they saw it. Then spit some bullshit game saying something like like you are a bush fund manager or something else dumb (these sloots are so dumb they have no idea its called a hedge fund lmao).  5. Don't chat long and say you gotta run lots of stock stuff to do. Get their number and 90% of the time you'll be pumping your baby batter into their sugar walls.  6, Use a burner phone and fake name. You don't want to be on that child support time.   Feels good mane. especially when in reality i got like only $800 in my robinhood account. When sloots see a balance of $5, $10, or even $100 million you gonna fuk even if you the hunch back. And don't at me that terrible. This dumb broad are gold digging. They can put up a front be we can't? Go out their and smash poosey homies|2020-12-28 14:43:22

hb7iqh|klohcs|klohcs|8|Guys if you haven’t bought GME now is the time. Up to this point, the stock usually plummets because short interests are doing whatever they can to drive the price down. The best they can do now is to prevent the price from going up.  Do you see where this is headed? Even if you don’t buy into the short squeeze narrative, or even the Cohen narrative, the stock is consistently rising more and dipping less over the last 3 months.  Unless you are just incredibly risk averse (more like profit averse), you’d be foolish not to take advantage of the dip.  I got back in at 20 last week and the shorts can’t even drive it below. 20 is the new floor fellas.  This stock is easily going to 30 in January when next gen console numbers come out. That’s 50% profit, that would make any advisor or boomer envious.  And that’s ignoring all the short squeeze evidence that just keeps piling up day after day.  Buy this stock.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|2020-12-28 12:36:13

Plenty of runway to exit this position if it goes south with it being over 6 months out, but this could have a huuuge run up since their solar revenue growth is exploding and we all know clean energy is will continue to skyrocket.|2020-12-28 11:10:49

The excitement, the enthusiasm, the curiosity. So many new pleasures and ideas to fool around with. We all get so hard with the mania. The honeymoon phase. WSB regains a new life. But this has gotten all too predictable, and we all know how this ends: Timothy loses his grandma's inheritance on GME weeklies. Sad. But hey, it hasn't happened yet, SO LET'S GET THIS FUCKING MONEY YOU COCKSUCKERS, LETS MAKE OUR DADDYS FUCKING PROUD OF US. MY KILLERS, YOU BE FEROCIOUS, YOU BE RELENTLESS.

hbavav|klohcs|klohcs|5|I am angry because I sold all my stocks mid march, felt like a genius, bought a 3x inverse fund at the bottom, lost 3k, sold it, then went all in oil... right after it rallied. Then it dumped and I lost like 30% of my portfolio, held on and now broke even.   But if I had just kept my damn stocks. I had amazon, bb, lulu, microsoft... uranium stocks... even some retarded indian car company that managed to go up!!! I'm even more mad because I messaged that guy who was predicted the GME short squeeze when it was 3 bucks, and thought "fuck I've made every wrong call, I'm down a bunch, I just gotta ignore this". Woulda only put like 2-3k into that play but still it stings.   GUH I woulda doubled up if I just did that boring "time in the market" strategy|2020-12-28 13:03:52

And that's only about ANT, we still don't know how BABA's e-commerce will have to change to please the regulators.

Also, I have lost more in AMZN this year than any other company I’ve played combined. Not saying it won’t eventually go up, but for now, it is really surprising to see it not tank back to sub $3000   Though, me saying this will cause it to have a monster week, so buy calls I guess|2020-12-28 06:14:42
ha7ezh|klohcs|klohcs|4|all this talk about how to pay less taxes and Roth IRA   Bro   U will always pay taxes on gains weather today or 5 years DOWN the road on those deferred tax gains payments  The only thing that can help u is !!! MOVING TO A TAX FREE STATE LIKE PUERTO RICO 🇵🇷   Or at least having your residence from there    There is also a step above this moving to Monaco but that’s a whole different ball game.  There is also the more advance of making your own S Corp and or creating a charity.   That is what ya fucks should be studying next making Corps and charity’s to pay less taxes or redistribute it wink wink 😉   Not this Roth withdraw till u 59 year old shit|2020-12-28 06:28:20

Ma is "taken care of" making the chinese hate boner go flacid and letting both JD and Baba continue to aggressively grow  3. Baba is fucked by china but only because of the beef with MA. This stays more contained to Baba and JD begins to aggressively grow while it's competition is being fucked|2020-12-28 13:03:13

hau7ly|klohcs|klohcs|0| 🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀   Guys, let's talk about FUBO TV. At the time of writing this FUBO TV has a market cap of 645M$. (For context, Netflix is 237.9B$)  If you don't know what it is, it's a no-cable TV streaming service. FUBO is currently in discussions with multiple organisations about providing exclusive sports content.   We already know that the US sports industries are larger than the GDP of some countries.   In terms of growth, FUBO isn't currently available outside NA. So assuming that they plan to expand to Europe and the rest of the world, this would be huge.   FUBO shares jumped from 8$ to 60$ in just 3 months. And in the last 3 days, they have dropped from 60$ to 30$ due to downgrades from analysts. You guys know what to do, you know how many times we have beaten back the cuc-bear analysts and broken the boomer glass ceiling.|2020-12-28 10:43:47

You want an able management team to operate the project. Above all, Marathon looks like a good mine down the road.|2020-12-28 13:20:36
