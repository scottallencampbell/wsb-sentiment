Greater wealth destruction than the bottom 450 companies' total market cap inside the S&P 500.  2. The 240 handles in ES from high to low was one of the top five largest absolute bands in history. 3. Not a single one of the NASDAQ's 102 members closed in the green on the day, the first time that has happened since the pandemic-fueled market crash more than two years ago.|2022-09-14 09:21:06

Almost two-thirds of the contracts directly impact the S&P 500. As we discussed in yesterday’s Commentary, options traders are close to neutral gamma in aggregate. While that argues that hedging needs are minimal, they can exponentially change as stocks rise or fall. Therefore, market moves may be exaggerated due to options expiration.

ofijkl|xdxv7a|xdxv7a|3|Guys I have a genuine question. For the past 3-4 weeks this stock I have invested in keeps opening at around 320 dkk and then immediately dropping to 250 dkk in the opening minute bar and then staying there or a touch under for the rest of the day. I am done with the stock now and want to cash out however if I set a Take Profit at 320, assuming it opens at around there will it cash me out or what because it basically immediately drops doesn’t give me a chance to cash it out at 320 in real time? I’m confused as to why this is happening I’ve never seen it happen before. Any advice would be appreciated|2022-09-14 13:38:49

The battle has not even started between Fed and inflation (leave oil flat to June and we're easily approaching double digit territory this month).

The company was not really profitable when gold was at 1800 and now with rate hikes on the way he is trying to get people to buy into a mine whos underlying commoditiy is going to tank. Its sad that he had to pump a non producing mine at the worst possible time for his rube investors to get trapped in a company that may be delisted before the gold price gets to a level where that mine is profitable.

oe01y1|xdxv7a|xdxv7a|6|Yesterday's CPI print was very, very bad. The Fed is going to have to raise interest rates a lot higher than people expect. The real estate market is probably going to get pummeled once 8+% mortgage rates hit.  The most concerning piece of data from yesterday comes from the Cleveland Fed, who calculates what's commonly known as the 'sticky CPI' (blue line):  https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/median-cpi.aspx  What it is showing is a big increase in inflation that is sticky. It is clearly, clearly a trend now in the wrong direction. It means inflation in the US economy is spreading and ingraining in peoples' expectations. It means the Fed's job is a lot more difficult, and they will have to be a lot more aggressive (say hello to positive real interest rates). A recession is extremely likely and bond yields skyrocketing, which means very viable alternatives to stocks.|2022-09-14 07:35:39

That is not at all surprising after yesterday’s overreactive disaster. $20 drop on SPY & over a trillion wiped out of the market in 7 hours and bears think that’ll happen AGAIN today ? Sorry bears but you’re not as rich as you say because either 1. You’d buy Itm or atm puts and be happy to play calls today 2. You’d close profits yesterday and wouldn’t get flagged as a PDT bc you should have 25k right ? 3. You got in last minute making you a fake bear bc you didn’t pull the trigger at market open on the fake pump at the beginning of open yesterday.   Guys the day will be very green or slightly green.

You can also remove the skin easily if the meat is frozen and then peeled while thawing.  Soak in a pan of salt water one hour; drain. Transfer to a large pot and add enough water to float the meat.  Add the vinegar to the pot.  Parboil, drain and rinse.  Let cool and slice each oyster into 1/4 inch thick ovals.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of sliced oyster to taste.  Combine flour, cornmeal and some garlic powder to taste.  Roll each slice into flour mixture.  Dip into milk.  Roll again into flour mixture.  Dip into wine. (repeat the procedure for a thicker crust).  Fry in hot oil or fat seasoned with the bottled hot sauce to taste (be careful, it will sizzle when you add the hot sauce); fry until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve with cocktail sauce if desired.|2022-09-14 13:30:27
