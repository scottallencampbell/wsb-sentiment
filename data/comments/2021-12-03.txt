n28pzo|r7wo5m|r7wo5m|15|Been going back and looking at previous scenarios like this (start of potential rate hike cycles) and the key is to just watch the 10 year treasury yield.  If the 10 year rolls over and then just dies (because investors are plowing money into bonds), it's a bad sign.  10 year has fallen to around 1.4-1.45%; you'd want to see that get back to the 1.6+% range if you're bullish right now.  Otherwise, there's serious potential for a move down to the 1-1.1% area, which would probably correspond to a pullback down to around SPY 430-435 and IWM 180-185 which is probably where "max pain" is right now.

n3u3w6|r7wo5m|r7wo5m|8|I just made a comment about GME being down and a couple of people responded it's because GME has negative beta.  I'm not sure if they were being sarcastic or if "negative beta" is the new thing that the apetards are slinging along with "hedgie" "short ladder" and "sucking cocks for free"  But if a stock has negative beta it moves inverse to the market- meaning that if GME has negative beta (which it does about -2) then it should be going up while the market is down.  So if it's -10% while SPY is -1.6% that doesn't look like an inverse.  What it looks like is money moving out of memes and people either going cash gang or rotating into value stocks.  Given the S&P is only down 1.6% then I'm gonna guess it's a rotation out of overvalued memes.|2021-12-03 13:43:28

n2auzp|r7wo5m|r7wo5m|8|Morning comments by [Paul Donovan](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/insights/chief-investment-office/market-insights/paul-donovan.html):  >\- Economically, it would be wrong to assume that the omicron variant means the history of 2020 repeats. The economic impact is unlikely to be the same because fear levels and policy responses are unlikely to be the same. This is especially true of the inflation implications.   >   >\- Inflation this year occurred mainly because lockdowns stopped supply in 2020, but welfare payments allowed consumers to save, meaning that demand in developed economies was deferred. That created a supply-demand imbalance in 2021, producing either shortages or price increases.   >   >\- If governments repeat their lockdown policies of 2020, omicron will be inflationary. Supply will be limited, but generous welfare payments will increase future demand. Because firms have learned to adapt to government restrictions, supply may be less affected than in 2020, making inflation forces less significant.   >   >\- If governments do not repeat their generous welfare support of 2020, omicron will have a deflationary bias. Disruption to employment without increased welfare support would hurt demand. If last year‚Äôs savings have already been spent, there is no cushion for demand as restrictions weaken employment. Fear of the virus, or more likely fear of unpredictable government restrictions, may weaken demand for certain services (e.g. travel), which would lower prices in those sectors.|2021-12-03 07:17:34

Personally a think that's a tad low but even if it's not and 5 it where it should be. Full year 2021 EPS is estimated to be around $5.98 so even if it wants to maintain a 5 PE ratio that would price it at almost $30 per share. to further support it the 2022 EPS estimate I'm seeing is $5.67. that would still be $28 if it continues to trade at a 5 PE ratio.  &#x200B;  What am I missing?  &#x200B;  Edit - other than the fact the entire market is shitting the bed.|2021-12-03 12:46:32

n3oua3|r7wo5m|r7wo5m|6|10 year yield is down to 1.36% (from 1.44% before employment numbers this morning, 1.6% last week).  This is the big worry right now: markets are pricing in lower growth ahead and that's why we're seeing massive P/E and P/S squash on high growth names.  If we're in the midst of a full correction then the 10 year yield will price that in around 1% to 1.1% on the 10 year, which would probably correspond to somewhere around SPY around 430 and IWM around 180.  If this isn't a full correction, then the 10 year will start to move back to 1.5% very quickly... and bonds will dump in a full risk on move higher.  Obviously, I can be wrong about the specifics, but the key is to pay attention to the 10 year yield.  That's telling you what investors think of growth expectations moving forward.  10 year yield collapsing is a very bad sign.|2021-12-03 13:07:51

I can't guarantee that your puts will print money if I buy 1 share, but the data suggests a clear correlation between my buying a stonk and that stonk tanking.

Spacex is failing and Elon mentioned that, and it‚Äôs his baby. He loves spacex. This merger would also help TSLA‚Äôs reputation move from just EV, helping with its valuation.

n3uat7|r7wo5m|r7wo5m|3|Simple thought experiment: what would some of these high growth names be priced if Covid never happened.  Those prices are the bottom.  Look at MongoDB.  Currently $440 and down $130 over the last two weeks.  It was at $150 before Covid hit.  What's a reasonable price for a stock like that if Covid never hit?  Probably $250.  Yes Covid did add some long-term value and pulled some years of growth into 2020-2021.  But some of these prices imply Covid levels of growth forever (see NET or DOCU last month).  My point is if you are looking to buy dips, don't just look for the names that have fallen the most; those may take a decade to get back to their ATHs if they ever get there.|2021-12-03 13:44:46

Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated. Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming. GameStop is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming. this GameStop earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and i believe Amazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to GameStop. so what do they have to do with each other? competitors and GameStops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.

Whatever expires worthless will be hedged by your other deep otm/long exp spy calls  Never bet against big $ trading, when they buy you buy.

Wrong. My risk-analysis is *absurdly* poor. **We can use that.**   Logic says I shouldn‚Äôt be making money. *We can use that too*.   Prior to thanksgiving, I was printing money for a month straight. That‚Äôs the first major sign we‚Äôre looking for with the Tumbleweed indicator. That‚Äôs not normal.   Second, I was looking for positions, and I thought ‚Äúman shit is looking kind of pricy‚Äù.   If I, u/Nervoustumbleweed, a degenerate gambler, think prices are kinda high, we can infer that *not retarded people think prices are **very** high*.   If I think prices are kind of high, *and* I have recently made a lot of money, a pullback is likely.

n3stro|r7wo5m|r7wo5m|-6|# Inflation is transitory and changing monetary policy won't fix it  The reason shit is inflating is due to ***lack of supply***. This is caused by the port congestion.  I'm sure most of us know about it, but here's a high level summarization of the port issues:  Trucks (caused in part by a trucker shortage) can't unload the port container yards fast enough for ships to dock and unload their shit. So they anchor off shore in a queue and wait until they can get in to unload their shit and head back. The issue is, by the time the get into the port and drop off the payload, there's already several other boats added into the queue.  This is causing a strain on supply nationwide and it is the main catalyst for why prices have been increasing. I don't see how changing monetary policy is going to resolve that issue (short of making everyone too poor to actually buy shit) in any way...  TGT, WMT, and the other retail giants [have been eating some of the cost of inflation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/walmart-and-target-clash-with-investors-over-low-price-strategy-.html) in order to protect prices in the name of customer loyalty. This implies a couple of things to me:  1. They also believe this inflation to be transitory 2. If they maintain low prices, the smaller fish that were **unable** to protect prices during the transitory inflation, will be unable to maintain high prices when supply chain issues are improved if they want to not get steamrolled by the giants  Which leads me to my next point:  # TGT & WMT are going to be eating all the small fish's lunch  The smaller fish (VSCO, AEO, KSS, GPS, etc) that can't afford to charter ships to keep shelves stocked or eat the cost of inflation to keep prices low are going to be absolutely ravaged by the big fish. Margin's will be lower for TGT & WMT, but they should be able to steal more even more market share in this climate, which will payoff very bigly as supply chain issues improve and margins are able climb back up again.  TGT & WMT are also uniquely positioned to weather the storm since both have already established & popular in-house brands that are already high margin in the first place. Eating lower margins on these for awhile should payoff even more so in the future when margins are able to climb back up.|2021-12-03 13:34:53
