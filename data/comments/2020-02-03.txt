gfyt3c|ey5kjc|ey5kjc|4|Some common characteristics of blow-off tops include (from https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp ):  *    Limited Pullbacks: Blow-off tops are massive‚Äînear vertical‚Äîrallies with no substantial pullbacks. This differentiates them from securities that are simply in a strong uptrend. If pullbacks do occur, they are typically only one to three days and then price rallies again. *    Massive Price Increases: These types of tops don't come after mediocre rises. The price may rise a few hundred or even a few thousand percent, with the biggest dollar (not necessarily percentage) gains in the stock price coming in the last week or few days of the move. *    Bearish Volume: Blow-off tops are followed by sharp moves lower on massive volume, which indicates that long traders are exiting the stock in droves. *    Broader Market: Blow-off tops are often exacerbated by wider market conditions, which means that a broad market sell-off could lead to a move lower.

In meetings, the Amazon.com Inc. chief expressed envy for how Musk had pitted five Western states against one another in a bidding war for thousands of manufacturing jobs; he wondered why Amazon was okay with accepting comparatively trifling incentives. It was a theme Bezos returned to often, according to four people privy to his thinking. Then in 2017, an Amazon executive sent around a congratulatory email lauding his team for landing $40 million in government incentives to build a $1.5 billion air hub near Cincinnati. The paltry sum irked Bezos, the people say, and made him even more determined to try something new.|2020-02-03 12:01:39

"This order to purchase securities, if accepted, will be paid for by the proceeds of the sale of securities or un-posted deposits in your account which settle on or before the payment for the purchase is due. If you enter an order to sell these securities before they are fully paid for, your account may be subject to a ninety-day restriction under federal securities regulations"   can someone explain in dumb baby words what this means? are they withholding my monies? is it just a warning?|2020-02-03 14:29:51

gg9dix|ey5kjc|ey5kjc|-1|What does an idiot look like?  >Literally, you just said it. America made the millionaires with this market. But those rich are now stopping others from climbing to that point. If they jump ship, small time investors can use the opening to start actually making money, making new millionaires. It's not going to ruin anything. People who try to optimize their dollar like that offer no benefit to society anyway, so fucking let them leave.  >The companies that "won't have enough to expand" because they have to pay taxes and employees are FAILED BUSINESSES. If they can't can't hold their own weight with a fair share of money going to taxes, they don't deserve the handouts to keep them afloat. But thats not even the issue. You have very obviously been taught by economists, because you think no growth = failure. Businesses can sustain size and business and still be considered successful. Unregulated expansionist capitalism is the reason small business owners and consumers are in such a rut. All of the benefits of our current economic state go to the top, and do not trickle down.  >I also literally just said our programs were useless money pits. Reform can be defined as gutting and rebuilding new programs. That's a part of the plan. It's like you only read the parts of my statement that offended you.  >Lobbyist don't have to give money directly, because politicians can still legally invest in private and public companies. Do you want to take away the politicians freedom to spend his money how he pleases? Or stop people from personally donating to his campaign? Because I don't. I think he should be free to do so, but without those companies sitting on his shoulder whispering the will of the Board. We don't need them representing the people, because thats what the politicians are for. We don't get to vote for lobbyists so they are absolutely not legal representation. They represent company interests, while the companies donate directly to the politicians "re-election campaigns."  >You're a child so I know you probably don't understand empathy as much as you should, but historical human behavior is not indicative of our society now. We fight wars for profit and pride, even to this day. But a lot of us don't believe in them. It's your idols that push the conflict to once again maximize how much they can stuff their pockets.   >I have no ill will towards you, but I do pity you.  You are arguing with a stranger on the internet because you believe fiscal security is more important than building a better society for everyone. You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and think about what's truly important in this life. You are going to die one day, not too long from now in the grand scheme of things. And on your death bed, I guarantee you that all the money in the world will not make you feel any less scared of it.|2020-02-03 13:11:03

gfburd|ey5kjc|ey5kjc|-5|why is no one on here talking about the potential coronavirus CURE they found in thailand? https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/thailand-sees-apparent-success-treating-virus-with-drug-cocktail/articleshow/73879572.cms would seem to explain the green fututres that everyones confused about  EDIT: to everyone, I understand its just 1 person.. I said "potential" cure for a reason... and whoever said it just treats symptoms, the lady treated actually tested NEGATIVE for the virus. My point is that something like this is a big step toward a legit cure and I didn't understand why everyone was ignoring it.. if ya'll remember SARS and all that other shit, it usually goes 1) total panic, 2) signs of progress toward a cure (like this), 3) legit cure...

gfkvuv|ey5kjc|ey5kjc|-2|Me very first buys on RH were solidish. Baba was at 160 or so, msft at 116. Anyway that was august before the dip and so im a noob and panic sell and decide to play pennies.  Lost 1k or so, hear about options over on RHBets, a sub thats kinda dead but alive in spirit now i suppose. So i lose another 1500 chasing spy puts and making all sorts of idiotic noob decisions and then, dejected, buil a proper portfolio. Pretty reasonable blue chips and your basic tsla and china tech barbell play, but also put 1500 into nissan for some god forsaken reason and so anyway, traded for mcd  All of this is a long way of saying, im back to my preoptions portfolio value and i think its gonna be all millhouse from here  Couldnt of done it without yous|2020-02-03 08:51:23
