The pain we have all felt happened with the NASDAQ not even going down by 10 percent. I personally lost 383,000 dollars of 813,000 dollars profit in the last two months with the NASDAQ declining only about 1000 points.  The NASDAQ could easily drop another 1000-2000 points with a market correction.  This is why I'm largely cash gang right now while the market has switched from easy mode to savage mode.

As long as Copper is over 3.80 though, the commodities bull market still looks fine though; probably just need to be patient on buying.  Gold/silver look like they're clearing out speculators nicely so if they manage to bottom over the next 2 months, that could be a decent mid-term opportunity given expectations for at least temporary high inflation in the summer (could hit 3% inflation in the US over summer months as economy fully opens and consumer spending surges).|2021-03-29 06:44:14

spyjqa|mfm3fg|mfm3fg|13|  **Volkswagen to kill Tesla with 'Voltswagen of America'**   *Sounds like Volkswagen is fixated to put Tesla in its electric coffin. So much so they even changed their name to VOLTswagen!*  Volkswagen will reportedly rebrand its US operation to 'Voltswagen of America'  All signs point to Volkswagen changing the name of its stateside operation to "Voltswagen of America," according to [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html). Earlier today, the automaker prematurely published an incomplete press release to its website it planned to share on April 29th. VW quickly took down the announcement, but not before *CNBC* managed to get a good look at it.  A Volkswagen spokesperson declined to comment on the release, but a source "familiar with the company's plans" told the network the document was authentic. The release characterized the rebranding as a "public declaration of the company's future-forward investment in e-mobility." The change will reportedly see Volkswagen EVs feature a badge that bears the new Voltswagen branding and a lighter blue VW logo. Any gas-powered cars the company sells moving forward will feature only the classic VW emblem in the automaker's signature dark blue color.  Traditional automakers have been all about EV-centric rebrandings in recent months. In January, GM [redid its classic logo](https://www.engadget.com/gm-logo-branding-electric-vehicles-210607845.html) to evoke "the clean skies of a zero-emissions future." The new design is also a visual play on the company's [Ultium battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-gm-ultium-ev-batteries.html). For Volkswagen, the change would come at a pivotal point in its history. The company plans to offer [300 EV models by 2030](https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-volkswagen-wants-300-ev-models-by-2030.html) and get to a point where at least 60 percent of the cars it sells in Europe are either hybrids or battery electrics.  *Ask Papi Elon to stop fucking around with his banana rocket, it's time to buckle up or Tesla will tank south to $69?*|2021-03-29 14:27:44

spo3p8|mfm3fg|mfm3fg|17|Bear thesis: A full economic recovery and return to normal employment figures has already been priced in and then some. Valuations seem frothy by historical price-to-earnings ratio averages, and stocks have been highly sensitive to any suggestions of tapering from the Fed. A return to normal SLR requirements is coming April 1st. Increasing bond yields, combined with quarterly rebalancing of pension funds, should create downward pressure in the coming days. Widespread speculative rallies in various investments that have no inherent value backing them up, and very strong retail participation in the market as reflected in the rapid growth of subscribers to wsb, suggest this period of time is very late in the market cycle and will be looked at as a bubble in hindsight.

socc8m|mfm3fg|mfm3fg|14|Things were a lot worse earlier in the overnight session, when Nomura and Credit Suisse cautioned of big losses tied to Archegos Capital, a hedge fund unwinding a series of block trades. Those concerns appear to have faded. The Nikkei, which was seeing most of the selling earlier, is actually positive for the day, up 0.7%.  I talk a lot about unexpected events that can upend the big picture. Covid was one such event. It appears unlikely at this point that this is another.  That leaves us with another slow week. The Suez situation appears to be headed to a resolution. It‚Äôs a holiday-shortened week due to Good Friday, though non-farm payrolls will be released on Friday anyway and the bond market is open for half of the day. But non-farms have been kind of meh lately and many investors say the weekly jobless claims are a better gauge of the employment picture.  One thing to look to is this Biden infrastructure plan and accompanying stimulus package (yes, another one). That will be announced on Wednesday. It will apparently be paid for by tax increases on businesses and the wealthy, which may not be greeted well by the market.  Other than that the constructive outlook for buying risk assets remains intact.|2021-03-29 06:20:13

splefy|mfm3fg|mfm3fg|15|I'm constantly changing my investment strategies in this fucked up market.  For what it's worth my current strategy is:  1). Don't initiate a long position in anything right now.  Even at current prices the stocks have run up so much there is a lot more downside than there is upside.  Investing long at current prices is like bending down to pick up pennies in front of a moving freight train.  2). Leaps feel safe in a few stocks:  \-I like BA 255 call for one year out.  The stock was 350 pre-COVID, is a solid reopening play, and doesn't care about inflation or interest rates.  \-Potential airline or cruiseline plays for two years out, but even these don't feel all that solid.  3)  Options is pure gambling right now.  Nothing wrong with this, but you might as well throw a dart in the dark.  4). Day trading seems to be a reasonable way to gamble in this market.  Specifically, I have made big plays into stocks that I wouldn't hate holding at the price I jump in at, but I'm hoping will go up so I can jump back out.  In this Kangaroo market I'm not really going long on anything.  5). Stay largely cash gang and wait to pounce if there is a huge crash. The issue is my fucking FOMO and my degenerate nature.  6). Sell covered calls if you have the shares.  Just set your strike at a price you don't mind selling at.  Any thoughts are welcome.  Please share any winning strategies you may have.  &#x200B;  Edit:  I know which thread I'm on guys.  I'm all for option plays if you guys want to make them.  What I'm saying is there is nothing to go on in terms of making informed plays.  You can think you know what you're doing, but it's all luck at this point.|2021-03-29 12:48:37

The more you lost, the more you need to stop being depressed about it and look to the future, because the more you lost the more of the money coming back into the market next quarter is *your* money that you need to win back, and if you have no money left because you lost *all* of it in a frantic depression trying to escape your losses, all you can do is watch other traders vacuum up your money while you wish you had buying power for the most obvious and lucky plays you've ever seen on the market in your little career.

spgi88|mfm3fg|mfm3fg|0|How to Spot WSB Mod DRAMA 101, A course on not being surprised when the sub is taken private due to mod drama.  In the past, what has preluded WSB mod drama? * Big events that make the sub feel more like an event coordinator: the Mark Cuban AMA, for example.  * New, unknown mods suddenly being relegated new important positions.  * The sub being monetized or capitalized in some shape or form (merch shop, power up, using the subs influence like @WSB_MOD, though the current Twitter seems better and I trust zjz). * Mod silence on various aspects.  Why does it matter? * Because it sucks when the sub goes private all of the sudden because the mods are throwing a bitch fit. * Because it sucks for the sub to be monetized. * Because disention (liking or disliking certain stocks) can be stamped out through various methods. * Because there seems to be decreased mod quality. * The sub becomes more hype focused, usually to drum up a user base and generate clout for whoever is benefiting from it.  What can you do? * Probably nothing but prepare for the sub going private for a couple hours (has done so at least twice since the start of the GME fiasco). * Don't participate in or exacerbate the drama when it eventually blows up or comes to light. Don't engage in harassment, etc., that may jeopardize the integrity of the sub (including spamming r/SubredditDrama). They're a bunch of twats who like to observe and cause drama over there, anyways, and it makes the Reddit admins not like us. * Don't üìÉüëê your positions or overreact as long as the situation surrounding your original thesis doesn't change. This one is the most important.|2021-03-29 12:12:16

The S&P also following a similar path isn‚Äôt a prediction it‚Äôs a fact. It can only trade above the NASDAQ & RUS for a finite amount of time before there is a regression to the mean (it will happen the question is just when)   Like the other two it needs to take a breath go down & creat a new base and keep moving. S&P 200 day moving average is 3,600 (that‚Äôs the sweet spot and ironically it‚Äôs also around the 10% margin).|2021-03-29 05:13:34

sq0trm|mfm3fg|mfm3fg|0|Vireo (tick is VREOF) seems massively oversold right now. It is a scientist-led marijuana company focusing on high end quality and customer care.  In short, they have experienced a massive price drop in recent weeks for no clear reason other than general industry selloff. Their fundamentals are strong. They just received a huge loan to expand their cultivation facilities, and they are prioritizing putting that cash towards other growth opportunities too including "first-mover markets". In other words, these guys are making big plays, currently at a big discount, and it just so happens to be cheap as well.  And my personal cherry is that their executives seem to be a really solid group covering different aspects of the company in synergistic ways. Forward thinking but with experience and vision. This isn't a short squeeze that will shoot up 200% in a day, but it is a solid company with potential for bigger and faster growth than almost any other non-squeeze stock on the market.  Note: It is not available on RH but is on TD and other platforms.  Double note: Current position is 39 shares at $4.25. Working on getting it to 4.20 :)|2021-03-29 14:45:20

Like phoenix sky harbor airport should track the price of oil since they mainly just hold undeveloped oil field real estate as far as I can tell, but since swing trading oil these days is risky and only informed traders would find this stock the shareholders aren't taking the risk of swing trading and there isn't any eyeball traffic of people checking out the stock to assess its price or consider buying it so instead of tracking the price of oil, you just flip a coin to predict daily price movements based on whether a big buy will randomly happen that day or a big sell will randomly happen that day or neither. The long-term shareholders must wait like half a fucking year before actually seeing price changes as price changes and reacting to them, because the price chart doesn't look anything fucking like the oil price chart unless you shift one about 6 months closer to the other. It's so fucking annoying to hold as an active trader and passive traders aren't gonna find it.  All this adds up to nobody wanting it, which gives it guaranteed gains because there's not much of a bubble to worry about popping and the swindling supply of oil isn't even priced in, let alone inflated meme demand on top of it. But it's almost like being a wage cuck, in order to get paid I have to actually endure suffering and stress knowing that every day I check this ticker all it's going to do is either scare me, give me hope, or neither, just to fuck with my head while having so close to zero chance of any useful actionable information.   I'm jealous of people who got lucky on the buying side with this one, for them it's probably not so annoying to hold the stock and way closer to being free money than wage cucking. But if they're strategic enough to hold stocks like this then they too have had times they weren't lucky on the buying side and it was annoying as fuck for them to hold something long term so I guess it's nothing to be envious of, just the random differences in dice rolls that always average out to the same levels eventually, all else being equal.|2021-03-29 09:24:39

spqr1j|mfm3fg|mfm3fg|-18|I'm relatively new to individual brokerage trading, & have a dilemma followed by a question. I'm on E-trade & have used all but the $12.18 left in my cash acct, mostly invested in straight buys on GME (& some others that I bought in FUD that tanked, ahem, weed stocks), & even though I could, I don't wanna have to fund it all over again. So, now the question: what plays would a SERIOUSLY TENACIOUS investor make with ONLY $12.18 to have it grow EXPONENTIALLY, if this was ALL you had to work with? Like a riches to rags, back to riches play. I'm curious to see what could be done if you didn't wanna FOMO more $ from the bank to the trade platform, as if these were the only funds available, (also as if you lost down to this level & had to work hard & SMART to RECOVER from the loss.) Think about it for real...WHAT would YOU DO? A call? A put? A small buy on a highly volatile that allows you to day trade on it over & over again? No idea is off the table, just BRING an idea!|2021-03-29 13:28:27

MMs are well positioned to make easy money in a flat market. Citadel just tried to release some BS news pretending inflation and commonly retail traded stock price are practically one in the same. Now some gambler loses his stack (the money doesnt just dissappear either lol) and people are thinking a big bank could get knocked out. It's still a fucked up situation for employees of these companies and people in general who are affected by this - don't get me wrong - but this fund was a known outlier in %returns that was bound to crash and burn.
