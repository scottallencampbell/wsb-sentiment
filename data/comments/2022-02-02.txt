vbehou|silx0h|silx0h|1|It's been fun reading the theories in why link posts were disabled, but the reality is much more simple.   WSB is big enough now that its become the target of karma farmers.   It's really easy to post a basic meme that ticks all the right boxes and hits the front page. Plenty are trying, and that drowns out decent discussion.  Honestly, it's kind of nice to see a bit more effort put into image posts. Especially gain and loss posts.  For example, you can still post a meme in a text post, but you'll need to talk a bit about it as well. This provides the basis for meaningful discussion, and IMO it's a lot more fun than a contextless templated meme.  Personally, I think the front page looks way better now. A lot more like the "old WSB" so many were fond of. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this as well.  Link posts will probably come back in some fashion, but it will be much more limited to ensure text content can still reach the top.   Also, I think many of you will be happy to know, for some time now, r/wallstreetbets has been set to not appear on r/all, and is not being recommended to new users.   **TL;DR: WSB is not a place to farm karma and it's not a place to recruit people to pump your stock. Link posts and r/all visibility enable that, so for now they're gone.**|2022-02-02 13:30:37

Translation: Facebook will tank earnings and the stock will implode. Then ten years from now when the entire world exists in the metaverse and zuckerberg is worth $10 trillion everyone will be like “imagine if you’d bought it in 2022”|2022-02-02 10:42:47

valckr|silx0h|silx0h|6|I’ve manage mid-6 figs of ad spend on FB and… it’s the only big tech company that I’d willingly buy puts on.  Many targeting features are being removed, Apple’s iOS changes have truly fucked them, Shopify dropshipping culture has died down dramatically due to how ineffective FB ads are now which hurts their small-business bottom line, larger businesses have taken over temporarily but seem to always be mentioning “increased customer acquisition costs” so it’s not looking good for how sustainable their spends on FB will be for the long term, they’re constantly experimenting with new campaign algorithms like Ads Strategies but they’re grossly ineffective and they’re struggling to find their unicorn like they did pre-Apple changes.  Options are pricing in a pretty bearish move already so I’m just afraid it’s priced in. I’m also too much of a pissy to buy puts on mega-tech. But take this info for what you will. Maybe it’ll make someone money.|2022-02-02 10:32:38

vb7i9m|silx0h|silx0h|11|People will say that inflation and rate hikes are what will pop the tech/growth bubble. This will be given as the reason. Sure, increasing cost of capital puts pressure on corps that don't have big enough current cashflows to refinance their growth at higher rates. Sure. This has been mostly priced in. The unprofitable tech trash is down 70% from highs. But this is not why the bubble pops. The bubble pops for the same reason it formed, namely because it is capital misallocation. Inflation merely reveals that capital misallocation has been taking place for too long (years): too much money has been going into asset purchases, but more importantly, not enough has ended in the real economy where it can generate growth/production of goods. The oil industry states underinvestment as one of the reasons for price increases. How many productive industries have been neglected in favor of big tech? The bubble pops when inflation gets so bad that industries that were taken for granted become actual money printers.|2022-02-02 12:47:23

Didn’t see it happening, held all the way down to .80 a contract, SPY had a lil pop and dumped the last two for 1.00 a share. ~288$->~528$ ain’t a bad flip.

vbeqsc|silx0h|silx0h|3|>“So long as business activity goes on,” Albert Wiggin, chairman of the Chase National Bank, told a Senate committee in 1931, “we are bound to have conditions of crisis once in so often.” The committee chairman, Robert M. La Follette, Jr., then asked Wiggin if he thought “the capacity for human suffering is unlimited.” “I think so,” the banker replied. (It later came out, we might mention in passing, that during the fall of 1929, Wiggin used more than $6 million of Chase funds to finance an operation in which he sold short some 42,506 shares of stock in his own bank. In the process, while so many were being wiped out by the Crash, Wiggin netted the not inconsiderable profit of $4,008,538 from the decline in the value of Chase stock. The limits of his own capacity for suffering were not severely tested.)|2022-02-02 13:32:14

Market went up because money went into it and people took a pause from selling yo rebalance and reorganize. It’s going down now because the market is forward looking and none of the risks that made it go down in January have magically disappeared. And yes, we all knew megacap tech was going to outperform like they have done for literally every quarter ever.

vbiwou|silx0h|silx0h|1|In my opinion there's still a strong chance we go lower because if this market doesn't pullback to tame inflation then inflation will tame the market. Crude, natty gas, soybeans etc. are all still sitting at multi-month highs and they won't be able to pass it down to the consumer much longer. That was the reason for the initial pullback was crude being relentless past the market's comfort level of ~80. Followthrough on that pullback with a geopolitically tense background + China concerns is still enough to push this market much lower but I'm staying frosty either way.

Edit 3: WTF 600 upvotes wow thank you all so much this is the best birthday ever  Edit 4: Thanks for all the birthday wishes fellow r/wooooshers. I tippeth mine hat to thee on this pleasant morrow.  Edit 5: Ok, so this went viral overnight for some reason O_o 2000 motherflipping upboats I really have no words thank you all so much it means a lot!  Edit 6: ok I'm noticing some toxic discussion happening in this reply chain and I feel the need to address it. Sexism and racism are not cool guys, so please cool it and continue the good vibes please and thank you!  Edit 7: ok so I don't know why but I've received a lot of downvotes on this post recently, maybe i got raided by 4chan.com/b?? (commonly referred to as the "asshole of the internet" for those who aren't aware). I don't really ask for much but I was hoping we could show those losers a thing or two, so please give this post an upvote if you haven't already, it would mean the world to me and show these bullies you cannot mess with a good person.  Edit 8: turns out my girlfriend cheated on me, so that happened :/  Edit 9: so people have been wanting me to clarify the previous edit. I don't have the energy to go into a lot of detail so the general gist of it is this: Yes we were in an open relationship, no that doesn't mean you can't cheat on someone when you're in an open relationship. If you are having sex regularly with someone and never mention it until they get you pregnant, that is definitely a betrayal of trust even if you've both agreed that she can have as many partners as she feels she needs to be comfortable.  Edit 10: FYI, taking responsibility for the child does not make me any less of a man than you, actually it makes me more, so kindly fuck off please and thank you!|2022-02-02 13:23:30

All you have to do is look at the daily RSI on SPY, DIA, QQQ, IWM and then look at the VIX.   Protip: When ALL of the index ETFs are "oversold" AND the VIX has peaked without making higher highs, it's a bad time to be a bear and a great time to BTFD. To the bears and anyone else that missed out: remember that next time.   The time to be a bear is when the market is "overbought" and you get lucky...not when the market has already dropped 10% and is finding its bottom LOL|2022-02-02 08:25:48

vagb9w|silx0h|silx0h|-5|Y'all are buying insanely valued growth stocks, many of which barely make any profits. This is in a market with signs that many companies across the board are showing decelerating earnings. The Fed hasn't even started to unwind its $9 trillion dollar balance sheet yet, and interest rate hikes are coming.  There is still a ton more volatility coming, and max pain has not been inflicted yet.  It is just a brief reprieve at the moment during this storm.  Stop saying shit has been 'oversold'.  What exactly does 'oversold' mean?  Even after big drops, many growth names are still massively overvalued.  Just because something was once 10x too expensive and now dropped to only 3x too expensive doesn't mean it is worth buying the dip. It is still overvalued.|2022-02-02 10:01:33
