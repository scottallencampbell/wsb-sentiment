Pull up the inflation and Fed Funds rate charts as far back as their history will go. Not one single time, not one, has high inflation been brought down by a Fed Funds rate that wasn't forced to be higher than the inflation itself. So that means we need a Fed Funds rate of at least 9ish% and that's assuming inflation won't go much higher. And we are already seeing examples of price wage spirals, which in my opinion, mean the inflation is just getting started, not peaking. This market is major fuk, Bulls r fuk, and lastly thank you Fed for being such feckless cucks and ruining our economy.   TLDR: buy puts|2022-07-11 08:14:57

frfx87|vwepho|vwepho|2|[Why the Euro Has Tumbled Near Parity to the US Dollar](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-08/why-the-euro-has-tumbled-near-parity-to-the-us-dollar-quicktake)  "3. Is the 1:1 level important?  Yes. It‚Äôs a psychological threshold for the market. The first time the euro fell to parity with the dollar was in December 1999, not even a year after its inception. Just like now, analysts then pointed to a widening in the spread between German and US bond yields and stronger US growth. It was a dent in the pride of Europeans, who saw the common currency as an important political project and a rival to the dominant dollar. Today, the euro is considered one of world‚Äôs key currencies for transactions and reserves, though hitting parity is still symbolic. For the financial markets, currency traders expect turbulence around the 1:1 level given that billions of euros in options bets are linked to that big line in the sand.

fpt8mp|vwepho|vwepho|5|All Musk wanted was the user data so he could find out who was being mean to him online. He never wanted to own Twitter and he never gave a shit about bots. Then the fool goes and signs a contract thst explicitly denies him access to the very data he wanted then goes right back on Twitter to whine about it. Why did his lawyers let him do such a foolish thing? They‚Äôll get to feast on those fees for years and they don‚Äôt give a shit one way or the other if the spoiled manchild gets his way or not as long as they get paid. He wouldn‚Äôt listen to them if they told him no anyway. So now twitter has an open and shut case in one of the most experienced business courts in the world that lets them either wash their hands completely of a failing social media site while simultaneously walking away with barrels of cash, or let‚Äôs them keep control of the site while also walking away with barrels of cash if they decide to pursue liquidated damages. Like, why the fuck would you sign a contract that waives due diligence when you‚Äôre so concerned about the ‚Äúbots‚Äù or whatever the hell he‚Äôs talking when that due diligence would be exactly what would let you find that out? It‚Äôs because Twitter knows he‚Äôs a weasel and there was no fucking way they were signing a deal with him that wasn‚Äôt completely airtight.
