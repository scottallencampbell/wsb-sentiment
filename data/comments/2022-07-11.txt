Without the market makers under his cult of personality the average trader would rule and actually fix the systemic issues of housing and wealth gaps. Thus undermining the whole financial system as we know it. So they wait, they wait for hope to swell and then they strike.   Yes my friends the Cult of Buffett is here today, but they will not win.
