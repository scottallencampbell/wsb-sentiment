ulnb88|mrbmfj|mrbmfj|19|**Daily Stock Market Forecast**  Things are looking bright and sunny today.  * Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board * Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000. * [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.  I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**.   That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.  *[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day.

ulanjg|mrbmfj|mrbmfj|30|Futures are pointing higher this morning, with small caps seeing the biggest gains. Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Nasdaq is 0.6% higher. Dow and S&P up 0.5%. That’s as of 0630.  It’s all about earnings today. This a day after Goldman, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo beat estimates. As I write this, Bank of America, PepsiCo, and UnitedHealth all came in and all beat on EPS and revenues. BlackRock also just reported and was the one outlier, beating on revenues but falling slightly short on EPS.  Still waiting on Charles Schwab, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp to round out the banks, but it looks like those ambitious earnings estimates were not misplaced.  Delta Air will report during market hours. That should be interesting where the reopening trend is concerned.  On the data front, we have retail sales and industrial production out this morning. And of course initial jobless claims seeing how it’s Thursday.  Bottom line: Things are looking pretty good for risk assets. Concerns about JNJ’s vaccine have faded. The reopening trend remains in force, at least in the U.S.|2021-04-15 05:53:37

uluc1e|mrbmfj|mrbmfj|8|Come here lads, and I'll tell ye a good campfire story.  It's the tale of the ASO 4/16 $35c holder that YOLO'ed it all.  Every day he watched as theta ate his portfolio.  As small beads of sweat dripped down his face, he stared at his screen.  Red.  Red.  Red.  His hysterical wife screamed at him, her bf whipped him over and over with his belt.  Each day his madness grew but he refused to sell.   Eventually he believed so much that he was right, he stole the bf's car, and drove as far as he could.  He parked it under a bridge and kept updating "Yahoo Finance" on his phone.  The car ran out of gas, and the bitter cold of the night took over.  He should have froze to death but no one found his body.  Just a cracked phone with 0 battery.  They say whenever you refuse to sell a weekly call option with no hope, if you feel a chill on your back it might be the hand of the ol' ASO call holder coming to feast on your soul.|2021-04-15 09:12:22

umfq54|mrbmfj|mrbmfj|26|I'm officially out for 90 days after being really stupid yesterday and taking 30k to 15k by FUD around tesla and constantly paperhanding stuff and switching calls/puts.  I am actually going to a therapist about my trading because it got so bad this last month.  Scheduled for 2 weeks from now.   I was up bigly (over 100k - I managed to be someone who had bought GME below 30).  Made money on PLUG, AAL, CCIV, apha, sndl (all the things.)  Then I bought into some other meme stocks (sndl, zom, ocgn, pltr) and this last month had me feeling like I needed to "make it back".  I had originally just made patient plays starting last March and that the reason I was up at all. Got lucky on some stuff but didn't fuck with day trades.  This last month I epically fucked myself feeling like I had to get back what I lost.  It became an addiction.  Constantly on Ameritrade, wsb, reading news around my stocks.  Not working, feeling sick, not eating, not working out, not spending time productive or relaxing at all.  As soon as insaw any red in my portfolio I'd freak out feeling like "oh no I have to fix that." Even though there was no emergency.    The worst part is I effectively had 2 stupid days where if I had done nothing I still would have been green on the week. But between just those two days I day traded myself to 40k losses.  I consistently chose fear and emotion over the plan I had set out and couldn't control myself.  I constantly feel like I have to fix it and the only way to fix it is to trade.   It was really fucking with all aspects of my life.  I'd be happy some days, and completely void of emotion others.    Since I began trading I'm now down 10k overall.    Hopefully I can work through my shit- this has been all I do every day for months now.  Stare at the chart.  Get emotional. Have no desire to do anything else.  Make bad emotional decisions after making good logical ones only to erase all gains made over weeks in a matter of minutes.   I consider myself lucky I didn't use the margin available and really fuck myself.  -10k suck, but I know others are worse off.  Maybe I'll never return to trading but I'll keep lurking and commenting.  I love this community, even the gay bears, for all the simultaneous support and shifting on people like me fir their terrible decisions.|2021-04-15 11:49:09

un83wb|mrbmfj|mrbmfj|12|The only way to get rich before you’re too old to enjoy it is massive leverage. Starting a business? That’s leverage. Real estate? That’s leverage.   Options trading may be the black sheep of taking on leverage according to mainstream schools of thought because of its higher risk, but every extra unit of risk comes with an extra unit of reward.   If you are young or make too little to have retirement prospects, trading options is no worse an “investment” than taking on leverage in any other form.

Basically, means in Japan their drug will sell for about $250K per year.  No idea the exact nature of their distribution agreement, but assuming the drug is picked up by HAE patients should help ensure they become profitable.

ulayw0|mrbmfj|mrbmfj|4|Friend from grad school got in on a company early who wanted to license his patent. He demanded to be compensated in equity rather than mostly in cash. Lo and behold a big name acquires the company licensing his patent. His shares get turned into the bigger company shares, which are over $200 each. Pretty sure my friend got thousands of shares and made out like a bandit.    That's how you make it. Just gotta hit one homerun working for an earlier stage company and get pre-IPO shares.  Then move on to the next company to acquire shares and then the next. All it takes is one HR and you're set for life.   My old boss did the same too. Word was that he got thousands of pre-ipo shares for like 50 cents or something.  Our stock eventually went up to $30+.  Pretty sure he's worth millions.|2021-04-15 05:58:13

(Also monopolist Bill Gates is buying farmland so probably be a monopoly squeeze coming)  I have just been looking for a way to have something liquid like cash for my cash position but avoid the 9% (minimum ...probably more) annual buying power loss. I figure farmland probably wont go down if the world ends.  And these REIT's make buying land completely liquid.  anyone have any other ideas to store the portion of your wealth you want to keep risk free and mostly fluctuation free but still liquid but not in gold or silver and not exposed to the extreme loss of buying power the US dollar is experiencing as we speak?|2021-04-15 12:46:35
