I don't think it's over for the highest risk cloud stocks, but this is just a general rotation back towards less risky stocks while markets are near all time highs and while there is significant concern that cloud stocks won't be able to post 30-50% growth rates if the trade war dampens corporate spending.

zpjolt|d1qigj|d1qigj|2|I'm going to be closely watching the Consumer Price Index data this Thursday morning at 8:30am. Last month's data (July data released in August) indicated we were at about 1.8% inflation over the past 12 months, up from 1.6%, and that was before the Fed cut rates.     If the 12-month inflation dips from that level, it gives the Fed reason to be dovish. If it increases and gets closer to their 2.0% target inflation, it gives them reason to be hawkish. If you're planning on buying calls or puts going into the FOMC meeting, you might want to buy them the morning of the 12th rather than waiting to buy them on the 18th when IV could be higher.

zpwp7y|d1qigj|d1qigj|1|JPM midday market commentary for institutional clients   Overview   ‚Ä¢ Equity levels: SPX up 5 points to 2983, Dow up 84 points to 26881, Nasdaq up 12 points to 8115, and R2K up 14 points to 1519.   &#x200B;  ‚Ä¢ Market update ‚Äì it‚Äôs a relatively slow morning in terms of major incremental news but the SPX is extending its move from last week w/gains driven by 1) US-China trade hopes (driven by two specific headlines/articles, including https://cnb.cx/2lDZY5B and https://politi.co/2lJA0NN) and 2) central bank anticipation (w/the ECB coming up on Thurs 9/12). As has been the case for a few days, there is a clear pro-cyclical bias beneath the surface w/groups such as energy, banks, steel, and transports outperforming. The bigger picture backdrop looks the same w/\~3K a fundamental ceiling (driven by the twin constraints of \~$178 and \~17x) but sentiment has flipped from the dreary days of Aug and there is def. a bid in the market (whether that bid if a genuine one underpinned by fundamental optimism or the more cyclical sort driven by ‚Äúpositioning‚Äù-led arguments remains to be seen but in the near-term it doesn‚Äôt matter).   &#x200B;  ‚Ä¢ US equity sector trends ‚Äì the pro-cyclical bias continues w/groups such as banks, cap goods, energy, steel, transports, and autos all doing very well (brick-and-mortar retail is doing well too). The big Barclays fins. Conf. kicked off this morning and so far a handful of banks provided intra-Q updates (BK, CMA, and WFC). The bar for the group into this event was VERY low w/most investors assuming firms would have to talk down NIM/NII guidance ‚Äì that did happen (CMA and WFC) but the updates haven‚Äôt been any worse than feared (and BK actually said it was tracking to its prior NII guidance). Many people are watching WFC ‚Äì if that stock can shrug off the NII cut it will send a green light that the group is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to own. Safer-haven groups are struggling (including staples, utilities, etc.) although AT&T is bucking that trend on back of the Elliott news. Super-cap tech is lagging too (keep in mind that super-cap tech stocks in a lot of waves act like safe-havens so its underperformance on a day led by cyclicals isn‚Äôt shocking ‚Äì MSFT, V, MA, PYPL, ADBE, etc., are among the biggest point headwinds in the SPX). AMGN is weak off the weekend data release.   &#x200B;  ‚Ä¢ Treasuries/FX ‚Äì Treasuries are for sale in sympathy w/the broader risk-on bias (and the curve is steepening out). The DXY is trading off \~20bp. ‚Ä¢ US inflation expectations sink according to the latest NY Fed survey (out at 11amET) - the August survey shows the median inflation expectation declined by 0.2 percentage point at the one-year horizon to 2.4 percent (a new series low), and by 0.1 percentage point at the three-year horizon to 2.5 percent.   ‚Ä¢ Calendar for Mon 9/9 ‚Äì there isn‚Äôt anything major on the calendar for after the close other than CTRP earnings.   ‚Ä¢ Calendar for Tues 9/10 ‚Äì the focus will be on China CPI/PPI for Aug (Mon night/Tues morning), US JOLTs for Jul (10amET), US politics (the North Carolina 9th congressional district special election), the {\[{91FfR1\_nUlgKBLVSAmnQEnUW6GwxtvaPKg\_lpQVb886OBA-Lh4AbEWQoPh16Ri0KxnyaZmblWlgP2Oc\_0Icp6hU7Xxh3tzCs}\]} AAPL product launch event (1pmET), analyst meetings (DOV, DVA, TWNK, and VSTO), earnings (FRAN and HDS before the open and GME, PLAY, RH, and ZS after the close), and conferences (Barclays financial services, Deutsche Bank tech, and Morgan Stanley healthcare). Financials  &#x200B;   ‚Ä¢ The financials are enjoying a very strong rally as part of the pro-cyclical bias in the market (the TSY yield rise is helping too). A few firms have given updates around the Barclays conf. already and most were outright positive (like ALLY or BK) or better-than-feared (like WFC). WFC came out and cut its NII guidance again but the stock is stock is trading very well ‚Äì this is acting as a huge green light for the bank complex to continue rallying. BK is one of the top stocks in the whole market after mgmt. said it was still tracking to its prior NII guidance. FNMA and FMCC are surging after Mnuchin said Treasury may soon adjust the profit sweep and permit the companies to build capital. Consumer   &#x200B;  ‚Ä¢ Retail (JP1RTL +1.6%) outperforming w/the near-term tradeable rally in the group continuing driven by unwind of V negative positioning coming out of Q2 earnings, positive BTS/QTD commentary at GS Retail Conf. last week, tariff optimism (commentary has generally been much better than feared & optimism re trade tensions easing w/Fri night‚Äôs Politico article), etc. Outperformers inc. more heavily shorted/out-of-favor sectors Dept. Stores, Accessories, Mall-based apparel, Home Furnishings, etc. Restaurants (JP1RST +0.2%) up slightly w/the broader market driven by LK (+5%), CMG (+2% on sellside upgrade) & Casual Dining (CAKE +3%, EAT +2%, DRI +1.5%) while global quick-service/franchised names underperform on rally in rates (MCD, YUM, WEN, DNKN dn 1-2%). Cons. Staples (JP1STP dn 0.3%) underperforming on risk-on move in the market/unwind i.e. more out-of-favor names like KHC/TAP/NWL +3% while the higher quality KO, PEP, CL, KMB, CLX, CHD are dn \~1.5-2.5%. ENR is +4% on a sell-side double-upgrade. Industrials ‚Ä¢ Industrials ‚Äì cap goods are picking up right where they left off as the JP1IND index sits with another 1% gain as we head into the middle of today‚Äôs trading session. There wasn‚Äôt much out this weekend as far as industry/company specific news goes, and the price action remains largely a function of broader macro topics (US/China trade negotiations trending positively, central bank easing) and investor positioning (there has been a clear pro-cyclical bias in the market over the last few sessions). The strength in general industrials is broad-based with most EE/MI and machinery names outperforming the market. ROP is a notable laggard as part of broad defensive weakness (ROP has been a safe-haven within industrials over the last several months). Aerospace and defense is a drag on the broader industrial complex with defense primes leading the way on the downside with across-the-board losses while BA exacerbates the weakness with a 1% loss on the back of reports of new issues with the 777x (this takes a backseat to the MAX in terms of importance although it doesn‚Äôt help and has the stock giving back some recent gains). Autos are bid up across the board as part of today‚Äôs pro-cyclical bias and despite another month of underwhelming auto sales data from China. Healthcare ‚Ä¢ Healthcare is the worst sector performer at midday (XLV -1% vs S&P +18bps) weighed by thematic macro trends where defensives and momentum longs are both indiscriminately for sale today as a source of funds trade into Energy (JP1ENR +3%). Unsurprisingly, the names under the most pressure today are the crowded longs (safe havens), particularly in the major pharma and medtech space. MRK in particular is getting a ton of attention today (-4%) as megacap appears to be a key source of funds trade, with seemingly no fundamental reason for weakness. Volumes in the space are slightly elevated (+6%) which appears to be a function of the various dislocations and macro driven sector rotation. In the micro side, biggest focus today is in the smidcap biotech space where MRTX is {\[{91FfR1\_nUlgKBLVSAmnQEnUW6GwxtvaPKg\_lpQVb886OBA-Lh4AbEWQoPh16Ri0KxnyaZmblWlgP2Oc\_0Icp6hU7Xxh3tzCs}\]} trading higher on disappointing AMGN KRAS update over the weekend while ACAD is up 64% on positive DRP data.   &#x200B;  TMT ‚Ä¢ TMT overall is modestly lagging the broader market but Software is the drag. It is the only subsector in the red (JP1BSFT -2%) as growth names continue to experience de-risking. SMID cap growth software results last week largely disappointed (ZM, PD, SMAR) and fears of the space‚Äôs valuation appear to be again on investor‚Äôs minds. Further, the upside to AT&T driven by Elliott‚Äôs activist letter is sparking an overall unwind in TMT as T and Telecom as a whole is largely an under-owned/shorted space. Semis conversely are outperforming (SOX +1.3%) as sentiment around the trade war continues to improve. AVGO is higher today +2% following Harlan Surn‚Äôs favorable preview prior to their results this week. AAPL is also modestly higher ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs new iPhone launch event where expectations are for only very modest hardware updates to the phone (camera, processor).|2019-09-09 12:31:44

zpr1te|d1qigj|d1qigj|-1|When a stock plunges and is immediately bought back, that means someone put an order in wrong and it got filled immediately right?

Even though the market price was far higher than that.|2019-09-09 11:28:49
