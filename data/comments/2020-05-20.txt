Instead of looking at SPY charts, ES charts dictate where SPY is headed. 2nd Resistance for ES is 2998 which means SPY is headed for 299 today.

r9lfin|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|13|(Don't DM me if a black swan event happens before this roundtable and you lose money)  DD: Florida Tourism Roundtable with Orlando tourist Mike Pence at 3PM ET. White House only schedules events during market hours when they think they can pump. DeSantis and Trump are buddies and DeSantis has been backing Trump more than any governor (debateably Greg Abbott). As thanks for supporting Trump, Pence is in Florida being photographed at local diners to show that the state is safe and tourism is endorsed by the White House.   Florida allowed theme parks to submit proposals for reopening last Friday. Expect this roundtable to be a pump up of reopening announcements endorsed by Trump with Pence as the model tourist. I expect Disney to be at the roundtable in some capacity. In fact, as I write this multiple sources are saying NBA will happen at DIS.

The announcement has gigantic implications for FB revenue moving forward. This made sense from a fundamental AND sentimental view.  I'm guessing there's a ton more in the tank here if you're willing to hold further out calls.|2020-05-20 07:28:01

r8rl9z|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|3|**Reason why $SPY will always go up**  The main condition to join the S&P 500 is:  >the last reported quarter must be profitable for the stock  >aggregate profit is needed to be generated over the trailing four quarters  This is why $TSLA is not in SPY.  Losers get thrown out, only winners join in. Unprofitable companies cannot join S&P-500, it can't go down by design! ✅  Macys was just thrown out recently replaced by Carrier Air conditioning.  Open the all time $SPY chart and just look at it. Losers will be thrown out!  **$SPY 350c**|2020-05-20 09:29:49

All 4 of their projects are listed in various websites tracking COVID-19 R&D, so they are getting recognized for their efforts and their efforts might pay off.   Is this stock a buy?  yes!!

We're forming a strong top boyz. The SPY 300 psych level will add some fuel to the fire. 300 could still break by EOW, but I'm getting out now and getting in the other way. Lots of air below us right now and my loins are telling me that this next slide will get us back down to the 240-250s. Sell off your overpriced tech and memes winnings and yolo puts if you have big balls. If were not sub 260 by June 3rd, I'll delete my 8 year old account and take a vacation from you idiots. SPX 2600P 6/30 (yes I trade SPX because I'm not dumb). I recommend inversing me, then inversing yourself, so that means buy puts.|2020-05-20 10:21:51
r8se9y|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|8|twas a mistake to bet against america. time to exit stage left down 90% in the last couple months. Gonna leave WSB for a while. No core cash lost, just profits from february but I'm annoyed - thought my analyses would be somewhat accurate but they were 100% wrong which is hilarious. Enjoy the run boys.   If i can say one thing - when you feel the euphoria and are numb to the gains, get out. Leave the position, take the money, and run. So much better than the gut feeling of having lost it all. At least im not indebted like half the tards on this sub but take care of yourselves. Opened some halfhearted meme SPY august 305 positions bc I'm 0/20 on my bear positions but eh, whatever. Don't really care.   btw - I've been here long enough (6 years now) that for every 100 grand gain overnight FD post you see, 100 people have lost their accounts, been margin called, and deleted their wsb history. People here used to post major losses but no one really does that now (march aside) - propagating the false narrative that everyone makes money. Don't believe it.   WSB used to be much more upfront with losses but somewhere the narrative changed over to pretty much gain porn only which is boring as fuck. Guess now it's stocktwats to shitpost on karens and their pennystock loss porn.   Make some money gents.|2020-05-20 09:37:07

r8tb7f|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|2|Advice please. I’m sitting on a 6/19 DOCU 130c/135c spread. If DOCU gets past 135. I pretty much need to start thinking about selling it right? What I mean is, I know if I sit on it until 6/19 and it stays above 135, I’ll get almost 500 bucks. I bought the spread for 1.50. However,  if it drops below 130 I’ll be sort of screwed. I guess it is a bit early to decide since earnings are 6/4. Sadly, I only have one spread. So no way to sell a few and keep.   Thanks for any advice.  Edit: right now I could sell for 2.50|2020-05-20 09:45:11

r8tq17|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|2|Ok guys, I'm having a realization rn that I think might not aktshooally be that retarded. The market has been steadily cruising upwards because the stocks that carry the market bigly (FAANGs MAGAs watever) have been benefiting from the lock downs and reaching all time highs. As long as small to medium sized businesses don't all get decimated by the time lock downs start getting lifted in more areas, this could potentially cause the market to start dropping again. That Facebook Shops announcement could have also expedited the process as they actually have a better chance of surviving now and taking some traffic away from Amazon n shit. It seems logical to me that a companies competition starting to return while it's at all time highs would cause at least a slight pullback ya? This market is completely irrational though, so I'll confidently give my prediction a 50/50 chance.|2020-05-20 09:48:49

r9gfk6|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|2|did someone here saying Amazon was going to buy Macys? The reason I ask is bc I know a buyer there who told me that when Amazon was supposedly going to Queens, all of a sudden, Macys bought rented office space literally right next door to the supposed site in long island city. All the buyers were pissed bc they work in the herald square building and their commute would have sucked. Most coming from NJ and that added like another half hour onto their commute. When Amazon cancelled the long island city thing they were happy. They told me way back when, that "amazon is going to buy us and they are going to use the Macys Herald Square building as their east coast HQ." Thoughts?|2020-05-20 12:52:50

r9mjav|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|2|Anyone else buying $DG calls for earnings next week?  They have beat with surprise the last few earnings, hired like 50,000 people in March to handle the massive spike in customers, current market cap is BELOW previous 12 month trailing revenues, currently trading at 177-178 and has price targets if 200-220 with BUYS across the board. Also tons of broke ass people not working who are budgeting.  Tl;dr My position:  #$DG 07/17 $190c  Edit - I should mention, July volume may be low but June's volume indicates interest and if they DO beat earnings, the volume will come. Also getting in a week before earnings gives you the chance to play the IV run-up to earnings if you're not the kind who holds through earnings.|2020-05-20 13:41:43

r8hgez|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|5|I'm bear but SPY 300 is a possibility in the short term. Definitely a bear market rally though. I predict that SPY 300 will be an important psychological level at which people who were just riding it up, will take profits and will not come back until another big dip.  Most bullish theories are fully dependent on continued Fed support. You have a Fed that is quietly trying to taper down daily asset purchases, and encouraging the Treasury to take over the bulk of stimulus, while loudly saying their ammo is unlimited. Pay attention to what they do, not what they say.  With every additional trillion spent on stimulus, whether it comes from Congress or the Fed, it becomes less and less likely that the country can ever repay it.|2020-05-20 07:48:42
r8hvpr|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|4|Need to get this off my chest...it's been a week of massive fuckups for me  Entered last week +$12,000 since I started this on \~March 1st.   Bought $29,000 worth of MRNA 7/17 $70c for 11.23.  MRNA shit the bed for 2 days straight, and decided to cut my losses at -$8,000 still up +$4,000 and sold my MRNA 7/17 $70c for 9.28.   The day after, the MRNA 7/17 $70c was > 22.0...If I held for one more day, would have left the week $42,000 up.   The real kicker of it all is I meant to introduce a stop loss order to limit my loss to -$12,000...was busy at work and on my phone...ended up setting a limit order.|2020-05-20 07:53:24

r95cgd|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|3|> There is a long history of American presidential candidates using China as a campaign cudgel — from Bill Clinton blasting President George H.W. Bush in 1992 for dealing with a Chinese premier known as the “Butcher of Beijing” to Donald Trump’s 2016 attack that the Obama administration had allowed China to “rape” the United States while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. This election year, China-bashing will reach a new level, as Mr. Trump seeks to capitalize on high voter disapproval of China, Beijing’s failure to contain the coronavirus and persistent bilateral tensions between our countries.  > Desperate to obscure the reality of more than 90,000 American deaths and 36 million unemployed amid Mr. Trump’s utterly incompetent handling of the pandemic, Republicans have no better strategy than to play the China card. The Republicans are executing a 57-page campaign memo that recommends branding opponents “soft on China” and reveals their rationale for repeated refrains of the “Chinese virus” and “Wuhan lab.”  > For Mr. Trump, attacking former Vice President Joe Biden on China serves three purposes: to dampen turnout among populist Democrats; to deflect blame for his deadly mishandling of the coronavirus for which he takes no “responsibility at all”; and most cynically, to try to turn his own blatant weakness on China into a political weapon. Mr. Trump’s penchant for projecting his personal failings onto others is one of his most familiar and dishonest ploys — whether the subject is corruption, nepotism, sexual assault or Russian interference in the 2016 election, as with so-called Obamagate.

r9plhc|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|1|Okay, so one of my last times spamming this thread with HUYA questions.  I'm thinking about selling some of my 5/22 21C HUYA calls for something  like 6/5 22C, also all in, to avoid some IV crush.  My question, as a nooby trader, if HUYA blows up tomorrow, how much profits am I missing out on by switching from 5/22 to 6/5?  6/5 22C is $1.00, 5/22 21C is $0.60  Is it only a small difference in profit for much less risk, in the case they open low tomorrow? My plan is to be selling them tomorrow sometime between 10AM to 1PM either way. I'm trying to absolutely maximize the profits of this yolo play for my next play.  So, summed up, would going 6/5 instead of 5/22 cut my profits in half if it does turn out HUYA pops off?|2020-05-20 14:06:18

Wait until general market consensus is “buy.” 2. put up some decent cash to buy SPY after hours when no one is really selling, thus pumping the price on low volume. 3. During the day, sell twice the amount of SPY to all the people buying during the day. Price may drop some depending on how many buyers, but then I can just pump it up again the next night and do it again. My current sell target is 295, so hopefully there are more buyers than yesterday.|2020-05-20 06:23:40
