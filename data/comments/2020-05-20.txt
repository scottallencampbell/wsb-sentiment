r9lfin|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|13|(Don't DM me if a black swan event happens before this roundtable and you lose money)  DD: Florida Tourism Roundtable with Orlando tourist Mike Pence at 3PM ET. White House only schedules events during market hours when they think they can pump. DeSantis and Trump are buddies and DeSantis has been backing Trump more than any governor (debateably Greg Abbott). As thanks for supporting Trump, Pence is in Florida being photographed at local diners to show that the state is safe and tourism is endorsed by the White House.   Florida allowed theme parks to submit proposals for reopening last Friday. Expect this roundtable to be a pump up of reopening announcements endorsed by Trump with Pence as the model tourist. I expect Disney to be at the roundtable in some capacity. In fact, as I write this multiple sources are saying NBA will happen at DIS.

Losers get thrown out, only winners join in. Unprofitable companies cannot join S&P-500, it can't go down by design! ‚úÖ  Macys was just thrown out recently replaced by Carrier Air conditioning.

r8se9y|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|8|twas a mistake to bet against america. time to exit stage left down 90% in the last couple months. Gonna leave WSB for a while. No core cash lost, just profits from february but I'm annoyed - thought my analyses would be somewhat accurate but they were 100% wrong which is hilarious. Enjoy the run boys.   If i can say one thing - when you feel the euphoria and are numb to the gains, get out. Leave the position, take the money, and run. So much better than the gut feeling of having lost it all. At least im not indebted like half the tards on this sub but take care of yourselves. Opened some halfhearted meme SPY august 305 positions bc I'm 0/20 on my bear positions but eh, whatever. Don't really care.   btw - I've been here long enough (6 years now) that for every 100 grand gain overnight FD post you see, 100 people have lost their accounts, been margin called, and deleted their wsb history. People here used to post major losses but no one really does that now (march aside) - propagating the false narrative that everyone makes money. Don't believe it.   WSB used to be much more upfront with losses but somewhere the narrative changed over to pretty much gain porn only which is boring as fuck. Guess now it's stocktwats to shitpost on karens and their pennystock loss porn.   Make some money gents.|2020-05-20 09:37:07

What I mean is, I know if I sit on it until 6/19 and it stays above 135, I‚Äôll get almost 500 bucks. I bought the spread for 1.50. However,  if it drops below 130 I‚Äôll be sort of screwed. I guess it is a bit early to decide since earnings are 6/4. Sadly, I only have one spread. So no way to sell a few and keep.   Thanks for any advice.  Edit: right now I could sell for 2.50|2020-05-20 09:45:11

r8tq17|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|2|Ok guys, I'm having a realization rn that I think might not aktshooally be that retarded. The market has been steadily cruising upwards because the stocks that carry the market bigly (FAANGs MAGAs watever) have been benefiting from the lock downs and reaching all time highs. As long as small to medium sized businesses don't all get decimated by the time lock downs start getting lifted in more areas, this could potentially cause the market to start dropping again. That Facebook Shops announcement could have also expedited the process as they actually have a better chance of surviving now and taking some traffic away from Amazon n shit. It seems logical to me that a companies competition starting to return while it's at all time highs would cause at least a slight pullback ya? This market is completely irrational though, so I'll confidently give my prediction a 50/50 chance.|2020-05-20 09:48:49

All the buyers were pissed bc they work in the herald square building and their commute would have sucked. Most coming from NJ and that added like another half hour onto their commute. When Amazon cancelled the long island city thing they were happy. They told me way back when, that "amazon is going to buy us and they are going to use the Macys Herald Square building as their east coast HQ." Thoughts?|2020-05-20 12:52:50

Also tons of broke ass people not working who are budgeting.  Tl;dr My position:  #$DG 07/17 $190c  Edit - I should mention, July volume may be low but June's volume indicates interest and if they DO beat earnings, the volume will come.

r8hgez|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|5|I'm bear but SPY 300 is a possibility in the short term. Definitely a bear market rally though. I predict that SPY 300 will be an important psychological level at which people who were just riding it up, will take profits and will not come back until another big dip.  Most bullish theories are fully dependent on continued Fed support. You have a Fed that is quietly trying to taper down daily asset purchases, and encouraging the Treasury to take over the bulk of stimulus, while loudly saying their ammo is unlimited. Pay attention to what they do, not what they say.  With every additional trillion spent on stimulus, whether it comes from Congress or the Fed, it becomes less and less likely that the country can ever repay it.|2020-05-20 07:48:42

The day after, the MRNA 7/17 $70c was > 22.0...If I held for one more day, would have left the week $42,000 up.

r95cgd|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|3|> There is a long history of American presidential candidates using China as a campaign cudgel ‚Äî from Bill Clinton blasting President George H.W. Bush in 1992 for dealing with a Chinese premier known as the ‚ÄúButcher of Beijing‚Äù to Donald Trump‚Äôs 2016 attack that the Obama administration had allowed China to ‚Äúrape‚Äù the United States while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. This election year, China-bashing will reach a new level, as Mr. Trump seeks to capitalize on high voter disapproval of China, Beijing‚Äôs failure to contain the coronavirus and persistent bilateral tensions between our countries.  > Desperate to obscure the reality of more than 90,000 American deaths and 36 million unemployed amid Mr. Trump‚Äôs utterly incompetent handling of the pandemic, Republicans have no better strategy than to play the China card. The Republicans are executing a 57-page campaign memo that recommends branding opponents ‚Äúsoft on China‚Äù and reveals their rationale for repeated refrains of the ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù and ‚ÄúWuhan lab.‚Äù  > For Mr. Trump, attacking former Vice President Joe Biden on China serves three purposes: to dampen turnout among populist Democrats; to deflect blame for his deadly mishandling of the coronavirus for which he takes no ‚Äúresponsibility at all‚Äù; and most cynically, to try to turn his own blatant weakness on China into a political weapon. Mr. Trump‚Äôs penchant for projecting his personal failings onto others is one of his most familiar and dishonest ploys ‚Äî whether the subject is corruption, nepotism, sexual assault or Russian interference in the 2016 election, as with so-called Obamagate.

r9plhc|gn8r9k|gn8r9k|1|Okay, so one of my last times spamming this thread with HUYA questions.  I'm thinking about selling some of my 5/22 21C HUYA calls for something  like 6/5 22C, also all in, to avoid some IV crush.  My question, as a nooby trader, if HUYA blows up tomorrow, how much profits am I missing out on by switching from 5/22 to 6/5?  6/5 22C is $1.00, 5/22 21C is $0.60  Is it only a small difference in profit for much less risk, in the case they open low tomorrow? My plan is to be selling them tomorrow sometime between 10AM to 1PM either way. I'm trying to absolutely maximize the profits of this yolo play for my next play.  So, summed up, would going 6/5 instead of 5/22 cut my profits in half if it does turn out HUYA pops off?|2020-05-20 14:06:18

Wait until general market consensus is ‚Äúbuy.‚Äù 2. put up some decent cash to buy SPY after hours when no one is really selling, thus pumping the price on low volume. 3. During the day, sell twice the amount of SPY to all the people buying during the day. Price may drop some depending on how many buyers, but then I can just pump it up again the next night and do it again. My current sell target is 295, so hopefully there are more buyers than yesterday.|2020-05-20 06:23:40

So, in order to protect you autists from this bullshit, I've decided to crash Robinhood's servers to prevent bears from selling their puts until further notice.

Am I losing money by holding the contract until Friday/Saturday when it technically expires instead of buying it back for $5 today or tomorrow (if I can buy it back for that amount) and then immediately selling a 5/29 $35?  &#x200B;  Seems like I'm putting the money to better use from a time-value money perspective by buying it back when it's nearly worthless so that I can keep the juice coming.|2020-05-20 12:25:14
