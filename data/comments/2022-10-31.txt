How can the US get out of this situation when they had to print 40% of its money supply in 2020 alone to keep the economic wheel turning and house of cards collapsing in on itself. Now they cannot buy their way out of debt again otherwise currency becomes worthless. If they hadn’t printed all that money in 2020 spy would have crashed under 200 easily. Now economic conditions are worse and debt accumulated that we are unable to pay off. The fed is trying to buy time because I believe they don’t even know what to do. If you asked most people in 2021 to imagine prices collapsing to these levels this year they’d think your stupid or crazy, we have so much more room to fall. Expect at least another 50% drop from here into 2023 or a hyper inflated currency there’s nothing in between from here out since the only method of “saving” the economy was to borrow and print money.|2022-10-31 09:54:59uipo5q|yi6wh1|yi6wh1|10|Some of y’all pee on your own balls and it shows|2022-10-31 12:05:46uirfx2|yi6wh1|yi6wh1|11|                          ![img](emotet5_2th524271)

To create an illusion of a profitable business, Minkow began committing criminal acts, such as check kiting, theft, insurance scams, and fraud to fund operations and pay suppliers. To launch an IPO, Minkow hired independent certified public accountant (CPA) firm Ernst & Whinney (now Ernst & Young) to audit ZZZZ's financials to provide an opinion as to whether the financial statements were free of material misstatement. Minkow tricked fhe CPAs into using false appraisal documents to perform the audit. When the CPA firm requested to visit a building refurbishing customer site, Minkow and his associates rented a building and created a bogus customer job site.

Such a massive improvement over the first one which had very little plot/characterization. 

Lauren LaVera has top tier Final Girl vibes, and she’s an absolute smokeshow. 

Soundtrack was fire, surprisingly strong acting all around for a slasher. 

Kills had emotional impact while still maintaining the silly entertainment that the extreme over-the-top violence leans into.

Will be taking an std test in a week or two as it takes some time for stds to show up on tests. I'm not as concerned about this since she is an extremely high end escort who millionaire simps throw 10s of thousands of dollars at so the clientele is not the same as a meth head street walker. She also said she got a std test a few weeks ago and was all clean. Only reason I fucked her raw and for free was cuz I was dealing coke to her since she was visiting my city and we got drunk / high together one night and she liked how good of a listener I was.

Oct 26, 202219:30  
  
  
BTCUSDT  
−1.27%  
A popular cryptocurrency trader has revealed they believe that the price of Bitcoin ($BTC) has bottomed out and that a new bull run is set to start in the near future, while noting that long consolidation periods are “normal.”  
  
According to the pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader Kaleo, Bitcoin staying under the $20,000 mark was a “gift” that lasting for over three months was “more than enough,” In another twee to the analyst’s over 500,000 followers on the microblogging platform, Kaleo noted he believes the “bottom is in,” and that an uptrend is “imminent.”  
  
  
The analyst, as Daly Hodl reports, uses inverted price charts to compare Bitcoin’s bottoming process to that of its last bear market, which saw it drop from a near $20,000 all-time hi got a $3,200 low over the course of a year.  
  
The trader added that for those who believe that BTC halving cycles lead to bull runs it is normal to have extended periods “with a lack of volatility in the bear market base range.”|2022-10-31 09:27:03ui439p|yi6wh1|yi6wh1|-5|[deleted]|2022-10-31 09:39:51uijwgr|yi6wh1|yi6wh1|-5|ANOTHER SINGLE 50 POINT CANDLE DROP LOL GOT EMMMM - now the algos buy the sell orders up and BACK UP WE GO !!

This is one of the biggest droppers in the market today, it's had a pretty bad time these last 6 months but has lost over 5% again today.

So in the spirit of the holiday, and because it summarizes how I feel about the market these days to quote the "God of Thunder"(rears it's ugly head on the "Destroyer", which reared it's ugly head in 1976): 

  
"The Spell you're under, will slowly rob you of your virgin soul"

Under the spell of the Bulls, I keep getting hosed and they keep getting bear trapped.  In the name of all that is Halloween already,  I wish JPOW would just rip off the band-aid and raise it 3 % more one time and be done.  That's why I am a lilliputian, with all these little people ideas, but soon I will be:

a) in the same boat with these dumb ideas a year from now (9 million votes)

b) a huge success and taking over the world a year from now (- 14 votes)

c) shut up fool, you are wasting my time with this nonsense (yes)

For your own good, don't vote in this pole, I didn't even spell IT correctly. (or did I?)

You have until midnight to answer (or did I?), the first to answer this puzzle wins absolutely nothing, cuz if you read this far, you got, you got, you got nothin' to lose...
