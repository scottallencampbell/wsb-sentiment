yu9vgd|cynl82|cynl82|13|I think everyone is confusing the trade uncertainty as being under Trumps control and being a ploy to get rates cut. The Chinese are more in control at this point. Trumps presidency is completely reliant on the success of the stock market from here on out. he has dug himself way too deep of a hole to back out and let china win at this point. Thats why you saw him immediately retaliate when they added tariffs against the US. The Chinese know that trump needs the stock market to continue to do well for him to win, so I think they will damage the trade relationship by continuing to weaken yuan (which for some insane reason is not affecting the markets) and delaying talks. why would the Chinese ever want trump reelected? If a democrat wins, they'll immediately cut a favorable deal for China and this will be over for good. They're gonna drag this on and try to tank our market and trump can either backdown or enjoy the ride.|2019-09-02 15:36:57
