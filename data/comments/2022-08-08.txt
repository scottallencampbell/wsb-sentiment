"Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"  Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."  You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.  The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy.

jf8nvm|wj4yqb|wj4yqb|99|I’ve been here awhile. Let me break this down for you motherfuckers:  - BBBY was being priced as if it was going bankrupt, both shares and on the options chain.  - If not facing bankruptcy, it is easily a $15-$25 stock based on assets alone.  - Ryan Cohen bought in with millions in far OTM calls, has shook up the board and ousted the shit CEO.  - The shorts went too deep, like GME, thinking it would be bankrupt in weeks.  - Insiders started buying. There’s a chance RC doubles down.  - Buy Buy Baby could be sold off. There is a shareholder update planned for this month.  - There is a huge January gamma ramp.  - This is not a pump and dump. It’s a value play. BBBY is absolutely worth what it is trading at (unlike WISH and other famous WSB P&Ds).  - At $10 is a huge put wall. That breaks and this bitch could seriously fly.  - Many of us have been in this play since the -50% drilling, but couldn’t post on WSB due to market cap requirements. Now you’re seeing a flood of spam and fomo. It’s annoying, but this is a good play.  Edit: Thanks but stop giving me awards. Also lol to whoever reported me to the suicide watch.|2022-08-08 05:05:19

jfb3f3|wj4yqb|wj4yqb|5|It could be an important week for equities as US CPI data out on Wednesday may have a significant impact on near-term direction.   The market may be showing signs of a top with the S&P500 appearing to stall right around the highs from June.  After a strong NFP report on Friday, a hot inflation print this week could act as a catalyst for the next leg lower, as traders reposition for further Fed aggression.   However, with inflation being the Fed’s primary concern, any signs of CPI easing may help investors look past the jobs data, and potentially support the market higher.         All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see how things shape up this week.|2022-08-08 05:36:22

jfppmw|wj4yqb|wj4yqb|3|What a fantastic example of modern market manipulation, done legally the old fashioned way.  Cohen's got the calls - that is his fee.  Generates activity, promotes the stock. Increased volume draws in speculators, and then with advance in price, the public en masse. Buying and selling over the next couple of months, the price will rise, where the tape shows some stability and volume.  And then, when things feel toppy, they'll start selling the line on the way down. The public, thinking it's a "dip" buying opportunity, will provide the liquidity.  It's a trade as old as time, quite genius really.  &#x200B;  edit: he's got some balls to try doing it in general bear market conditions, though. Gonna get stuck.|2022-08-08 08:01:46

Felt like, if I can 10x in this sort of time this stuff can make me a millionaire. Then over a few weeks went to 30k then in one bad day to about 5k. That was Wednesday. Then on Friday decided to yolo my last 5k into bbby calls.

jfvlpl|wj4yqb|wj4yqb|2|So let's get the facts over what happened this weekend that could be causing almost a 1% pump on the S&P 500.  \- Senate passes "inflation reduction" act. This is in no way going to do a damn thing to inflation, borderline hilarious they dare to call it that. If anything taxing corporations more should be negative for stocks.  \- China's real estate literally goes into crisis mode. Defaults are going to start happening left and right as many mortgages are flat out not being paid for.  \- And lastly, comments by Fed gov. bowman saying 75 basis point hikes should be on the table until inflation declines in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way. Hint: This won't happen for many months, possibly years. They've underestimated this inflation many times, all the while I've been saying it'll be high and long lasting. It went from transitory, to "it'll clear up when supply chains do", to may be here longer than we think...Guess what, now we're at 9.1% and counting. Fed has been absolutely useless at controlling this and we will need a Fed Funds of 10% truthfully to bring this down.  Absolute joke market will see a day of reckoning very soon. Most likely Wednesday. Otherwise come back in September, with your puts.|2022-08-08 08:46:41

jffajw|wj4yqb|wj4yqb|1|For those wondering in America: TDG (EU/German exchange on which one can buy € version of USA stocks) just follows the exchange on which the real stock is available.  So stating "wow BBBY up 46% in Germany right now" is basically saying like "BBBY must be up 46% premarket in USA".  I know because I own a few companies on TDG and it's annoying that all price action on TDG is kind of fake until the American market opens|2022-08-08 06:24:53

jgsdv2|wj4yqb|wj4yqb|0|Lucid's revenue will be less than half of what they promised before last week, less than $1 billion. But it has a $29 billion enterprise value with negative $2.5 billion annual cash burn and only 18 months of cash on balance sheet until its flat broke. Its CEO admitted it is at least 4 years away from turning a profit. Meanwhile US headed into recession and Lucid costs 3x the average US car, while Tesla has sucked up all the luxury EV buyers. The Tesla Plaid costs $20k less and is faster, has much better lane keeping/cruise control (even though its not autopilot, its years ahead of any company) and same range.    Lucid also has gaps in panels and quality crap you would not expect on a 75k Audi, let alone a 165k EV.   Lucid is not making many cars, its goal is to produce Tesla's daily production in the next year.  Lucid only is good at issuing warnings about the risk of losing your entire investment.  Read the disclaimers in its S-1 and quarterly call again.  Lucid: Great investment or great ponzi scheme? you choose.|2022-08-08 12:22:40
