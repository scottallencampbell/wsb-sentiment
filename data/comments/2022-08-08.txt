Pardon the ugly ass graph…on mobile: https://imgur.com/a/flK18vD  Oil has outpaced energy and rates by a fairly significant margin since mid June. You would think energy stocks and oil would be trading tighter together as they had really since COVID but for some reason there was this break in their relative correlation recently.   Anyone have a theory? Leads me to believe we will see some regression to the mean from one or the other here at some point.   Also, energy today having a very weird downward bias with rates shooting up. Looks like a nice little short term call opportunity on xle/XOM for me|2021-10-05 11:58:35

fhaysi|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|7|Something important that the frenzy of dramatic people obsessing over short term price movements might make you forget if you're here too much:  "Stonks only go up" is faltering because we're waiting for budget decisions involving the money printers. Every day the market will wander around based on people's opinions on what decision will be made with the money printers, and if you have your own set opinion on what that decision will be, you can just keep betting on movement in that direction and the market will stop wandering around and go that direction for real when the decision is made and you'll make bank.  The daily SPY chart can help you optimize your buy in prices but you only need to really care what it's doing if you are making short-term bets swing trading on these fluctuations in opinion and hoping to successfully predict individual movements in where the market will wander around before it finds out what it's waiting to find out. This short term swing trading is higher risk and higher possible reward but it's not the only form of wallstreetbet you can do as an options trader.|2021-10-05 09:06:15

fiiopy|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|14|**Reason why $SPY will always go up**  Main requirement to join the S&P 500:  >last reported quarter must be profitable ✅  >aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅  Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.  Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!  Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!  SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows profits.    #$SPY 600c DEC 15 2023  100 call leaps purchased on July 21 for $330 each are still up even after September dips to $387 which is $5.7k profit https://i.imgur.com/Fl5DT5z.png  ***Buy the dip.

Today we examine the outlook for Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock, because the business is healthy but the stock price has just entered recession zone.  That’s not to say that Palantir will start losing sales, but Wall Street defines a 20% drop as such. What’s worse is that this happened in about a week."  #Stop, stop!

fhavuo|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|6|As a tier 1 supplier to 4 automotive OEMs (and also a supplier to several tier 1s) I have decided that their logistics leadership is filled with idiots.  I have been hearing the same message that they are going to kick up demand "next quarter" all year now and asking us to assess our capacity to meet a 130-150% increase in previous contracted demand and they still aren't ordering to contract.    The buyers are getting really pissy when I tell them I can't meet their imagined capacity requirements too.  Why do you even have capacity surveys if you aren't going to listen when I tell you there isn't capacity.  And why would I want to reserve your parts extra press time when you aren't actually ordering the parts.     Cooper Standard literally tried to demand that we make our employees work more overtime to meet their new capacity requirements. Our employees will literally quit if we have more mandatory overtime 😂. The whole supply chain is a joke.|2021-10-05 09:05:38

The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 2.1 million tonnes in 1991, representing a value of nearly US$9 billion. About 30% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, particularly in China and Indonesia. The other 54.1% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico are the largest producers.

fhurd4|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|6|My theory is that it's not Facebooks fault really, humans are just assholes and being given a means to communicate faster will make them bigger assholes faster. Think about it. Before the phone you had to be nice, because the only people you talked to you probably saw all the time. The phone comes out, people turn into dicks. The first prank call happens. Women use it to bitch and moan. It could have been the device that brought us world peace and prosperity, but instead we got Miss Cleo.  Facebook just hastens the natural progression to toxicity.

fh1c7g|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|4|So I just had this thought. Do you guys think that stoners actually make really good traders? I mean, they're super chill and don't worry about things. So when their portfolio drops by 30 percent over 24 hours, they'll just be like, "Oh well... I'm gonna get stoned." if they even notice. Then, a few months later, it's up by 10 percent, and they're like, "Hey, I can sell that and use the capital gains to buy more weed." And then they'll put money back into some picks and rinse and repeat.   The point is that they will be more likely to be patient and not panic. They'll also take small gains instead of getting greedy. I bet stoners don't get huge returns, but I bet that they are more likely to get consistent modest returns.|2021-10-05 07:48:18

He then went on to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies, all the while supporting himself by stripping. The other father never finished the eighth grade.  > Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled financially. The other would almost become one of the richest men in Nevada. One died leaving tens of thousands of dollars to his family, charities, and his health insurance company. The other left bills to be paid.  > Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in education but did not recommend the same course  of study. If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice.

finlh8|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|1|Squid Game had some great moments and I think it fostered tension very well, but the overall plot was garbage writing. The subplot with the cop was handled like an afterthought, the character archetypes were obvious and saturated, not to mention all of them were static in their roles. The 'tough criminal' dude was a struggle to watch in every scene, to name but one.   The allegory on morality and human nature at the end was written like a 15 year old's literature project - nothing original, the 'twist' induced an huge eye roll, personally.    Overplayed narratives of extreme wealth disproportion, dystopia juxtaposed with soft pink and mint colours. Itt felt lacklustre.   The score was nice, though, and there was some really nice acting - and a lot of the original nuances in the Korean dialogue seemingly got gutted. Ultimately, nothing to remember, just a pilot season with a good premise pandering for a second season which I will bet 3k is strictly mediocre, before a final death rattle of a 3rd season where they jump every shark in the water.   - me after my 9th G&T|2021-10-05 14:47:07

Funny, but Maine has the lowest homicide rate and the highest number of bears per Capita of any state in the US. You're more likely to encounter a bear here than any other state and less likely to get killed by a human here than in any other state. Still, we had 22 homicides statewide in 2020 and 0 bear attacks.  If you don't understand this you have not grown up yet. The woods aren't scary.

And just being like: "I hope maybe I can pump a bunch of pollution into the world and then die. In my wildest dreams maybe I could even be shitting myself and going blind before I die and whatever I leave behind for my loved ones could be enough to let them make it to the point where they're shitting themselves and going blind before they die too. And if they don't lose whatever I leave them with, the cycle continues to another set of loved ones, so maybe it'll be a while before we get to the point in the chain where someone's loved ones loved ones are shitting themselves and going blind knowing since they have nothing to leave behind their loved ones will starve to death or be contestants in Squid Game or something."   I would think this place would be full of visionaries and problem solvers with plans ranging from political influence to world domination.

figc0a|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|-1|> Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on one’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working on that problem. By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work continuing to focus on it. He did not mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. He’d say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.

They're like IQ parasites that hunt in packs, always lurking and watching smart people go by, until there's something in the air or the numbers are right or for whatever reason it's the perfect time to attack and they all come out of the woodworks latching onto the juggernaut to try to make themselves feel smart.

fgti3q|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|0|Do you think Tesla would buy corn at $30k if corn was going to go below that level? The halving cycles get longer every time with diminishing returns. This cycle should end February 2022. If the 30k will be the low of the next bear market and there is usually a 85% crash from the highs to the lows. That means corn will hit 200k at the high. Miners can run 3x leverage corn. So if corn does a 10x by February 2022 then the miners could 30x by then. Life savings in February 2022 contracts of a miner with the highest hash rate that’s not in China. I’m retarded.  - Tyrone Dickens|2021-10-05 06:28:36

Then just set a tight 5-10% trailing with limit trail $0.01-$0.02 or something.    Risk is a gap down cuts you off so still have to watch.    Benefit is obviously more gain if it goes up while also getting that feeling of need to sell out.|2021-10-05 10:30:05

fi3byc|q1t7nc|q1t7nc|0|BX looks to be bouncing off 108ish again as it did back in August. Pretty substantial pullback recently but if the run it has been on continues, that can be a great risk:reward situation. Max risk right now like 8-10 roughly on the downside and upside potential of $135+ or +$20 from current level. And that’s only until the previous high…no telling how far it may go if the run continues upward|2021-10-05 12:25:11
