xepux0|z1qpto|z1qpto|5|So tiktok is interesting. I don't seem them out and META on top yet. Simply because tiktok is pouring lots and lots of money into lobbying in the US, they're hiring ex-biden/obama staffers to help with the lobbying per an article I just read. So while the FTC is saying to ban tiktok because the data is being sent to China, in fact I read their US team doesn't see the data it goes to China. They're going to spray money at lobbying so they don't get banned and it appears to be working. This is going to be a thorn in Meta's side for a long time.|2022-11-22 15:48:02

He then became heavily involved in the marketing, which he is *very bad at*, essentially guiding them through putting together videos and graphics to show his ‚Äúidea‚Äù. That in the future we can do *so many things* in VR. Socialize, play games, have meetings. blah blah blah.   He did this despite the technology not really being there yet, and prices of even the cheapest VR kits being ~$500 and requiring a decent PC to even get full functionality out of.   Roughly a $1300 investment for a middle/low quality experience of current VR tech.   Now, if the reptilian moron had just slowly emphasized and introduced features while developing newer/cheaper tech, I think people would‚Äôve bought into it more.   >You can load into a movie theater with your friends from college who are scattered around the country now! Sure, real life is better, but it does feel like you‚Äôre together in the same space!‚Äù   >Look at all these fun games!‚Äù   >Look at this very useful software and this incredible interface for design work!‚Äù   >Look at how you can set up multiple virtual machines in a VR environment, and the awesome UI for developing that we‚Äôve made!

xebgb8|z1qpto|z1qpto|3|When you're under a certain income level,Buying a house is bad advice for most people and you'd do better to put that down payment into the market than buying a house. **I'm going to die on this hill because I can see the math** in work here. I think buying a house is bad advice given by banks and middle class and lower classes and part of why they can't leave the rat race. Similarly in this realm buying new cars and buying new furniture.  Don't be a wage slave, invest until you're a multi millionaire and and escape the rat race. Don't burn/lockdown your money. My 2 cents if anyone wants to listen. Keep getting told to shut the fuck up by everyone I talk about this too. I'm surrounded by wage slaves.|2022-11-22 14:11:52

xcgrdf|z1qpto|z1qpto|0|Going to buy ABNB puts at market open. I‚Äôm not a huge options trader, but I think there‚Äôs plenty of bearish sentiment with Airbnb. Along with questions of profitability and a business model that‚Äôs screwing over landlords. The market for ABNB rentals is over saturated and the economy is looking increasingly weaker day after day. I was a bull for a long time, but huge cracks are forming. Layoffs and struggling small businesses. High inflation and and hawkish fed. The only caveat to shorting or buying puts is there‚Äôs still a lot of money floating around in equities. With high interest rates this pushes people out of traditional assets and forces them to buy stocks. Stock buybacks are high and earnings are still quite good overall. Historically the market isn‚Äôt doing terrible, but the fear is at a fever pitch. When hysteria and fear enter the market it‚Äôs best just to set aside some cash. I‚Äôll be waiting for the feds first interest rate cut to invest in equities. Most Americans think we‚Äôre in a recession. It‚Äôs been this way for a while, but equities have been strong. I think time is running out tho. I still own shares in a number of companies but have taken profit on a handful and sold 50-75 precent of other positions. Let me know if you have and moves.
