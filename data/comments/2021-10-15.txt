China supplies the US with >60% of all monkeys used in testing.  The shortage of primates now delays the development of many types of US biotech for upwards of over 1+ years, and the shortage is getting worse.  China could clamp down on shipping monkeys to the US and US pharma would be fucked.  They'll keep all of the monkeys themselves for their own biotech. US won't be able to develop a ton of life saving therapies if China fucks w/ the supply chain for monkeys.|2021-10-15 07:25:03

grgmlh|q8l7gz|q8l7gz|5|As much as I love buying Calls, I'm a reasonable risk averse investor so I mostly trade spreads. I don't open both legs at the same time usually, I buy a call and my ultimate goal is to sell a higher strike for what I paid for the first one. If I can't do that, I look for a 10bagger potential. If there's $2.50 spread between the strikes max profit is $250 so I look to sell the next leg for a $25 difference of what I paid, If the strikes are $1 apart I look to sell it for a $10 difference.   This is way too many words for the daily discussion and nobody but VisualMod will actually read it, but thx for coming to my Ted Talk on how to lose your money 90% slower.|2021-10-15 12:28:29

gq4d5i|q8l7gz|q8l7gz|9|Yesterday's move felt like the kind of move that happens at the end of pullbacks, and it was accompanied by strong earnings reports as earning season started the past 2 days.  This is probably the point where you abandon puts and start buying dips (or keep buying dips if you already were), at least until we get closer to the November 2-3 Fed meeting.  Main reason yesterday's move was so bullish is that the market leaders approached or broke through new ATHs or closed their pullback gaps: GOOG, MSFT, CRM among big caps and of course UPST, AMBA, PANW and others among smaller caps.  TSLA showing tons of momentum the past couple days and basically just looks like it's set to challenge all time highs.  I'd expect some form of market rotation later in the year as we start getting to tapering (small co's look like they need to breakout at some point) and the tech stocks experience some kind of a mini-blowoff top, but for now market just looks set to get to all time highs especially with lots of stocks reacting well to earning beats so far.  Tons of money chasing momentum stocks makes it hard to believe we're still in pullback mode.|2021-10-15 06:12:22

grg5qe|q8l7gz|q8l7gz|3|Dumb question, but when looking at candle charts, why is it for stocks/etfs that closely follow the indexes (or vice versa), price spikes/dips seem to often occur at the exact same time?   Obviously, if a big ass candle forms on an AAPL chart, it will form on the SPY or QQQ chart, but why is one also forming on NVDA, MSFT, FB, etc charts? I understand the interrelation, but don't quite get what is technically happening - why does a increase in buy/sell orders for AAPL cause an increase in orders for NVDA at the same time? Was this the case before algos?|2021-10-15 12:25:18

gqlxx4|q8l7gz|q8l7gz|7|One of the most interesting things about all these labor strikes going on is that it has been near universal that a primary complaint by the unions has revolved around mandatory/excess overtime.  Wages have been involved but the wage demands and increases really aren't that significant in the overall picture considering most seem to be taking relatively smaller raises compared to inflation and what you would expect labor could demand.  Kellogg's workers don't like the excess Overtime, Frito workers wanted overtime pulled back, and John Deere  just went on strike with overtime limitations being one of their clear goals.  Also why the hell do you let workers go on strike when you are so desperate for production that you are forcing people to work 60+ hours a week endlessly 🤣|2021-10-15 08:54:27

gqjpvw|q8l7gz|q8l7gz|2|# LTH (Life Time Holdings Inc.)   recently IPO'd at a valuation of around $2.78 Billion, with a share value of $18. It's currently trading at $17.62 per share, currently not optionable.  The company is on track for a $345 Million in EBITDA next year based on post covid membership rates, giving an enterprise multiple of 14. Planet Fitness has an enterprise multiple of 27, making it the cheaper of the two fitness stocks. If it were to match up to meet Planet Fitness' multiple, it would have a share price of $34, or 92% upside.  The company focuses on higher end fitness facilities and "resort" style amenities for customers. Middle class and wealthier people have generally identified that fitness is of particular importance based on the recent trends with Peloton and other at-home equipment. However, those aren't particularly "sticky" in terms of consistent customer usage and growth. People *want* to get out of the house, and they need more than one single exercise to keep interested. Planet Fitness has already priced in future years' assumed growth, but LTH has not.

The iron condor earns the maximum profit when the underlying asset closes between the middle strike prices at expiration. In other words, the goal is to profit from low volatility in the underlying asset.  The iron condor has a similar payoff as a regular condor spread, but uses both calls and puts instead of only calls or only puts. Both the condor and the iron condor are extensions of the butterfly spread and iron butterfly, respectively.|2021-10-15 11:43:55

gqq5qx|q8l7gz|q8l7gz|4|Unfortunately i tried to warn you guys on Corsair. I am in the global electronics and chip manufacturing business. the one time I thought I could help everyone !  :  Shares of Corsair Gaming, Inc. (CRSR) declined 7% in Thursday’s extended trading session after the company revealed that it expects to report Q3 net revenues of $391 million, much lower than the Street’s expectations of $485.2 million.        Corsair develops and manufactures high-performance gear and technology for gamers, content creators, and PC enthusiasts. (See Corsair stock charts on TipRanks)        The company said that the key reasons behind the poor revenue guidance are global logistics and supply chain issues, especially the lack of affordable GPUs in the retail channel. Corsair expects this to have impacted revenues by about 10%.|2021-10-15 09:26:13

I think what has happened here is that the massive OI in 10/15 puts decayed to nothing, hence the bump.     The fact remains, though, that this company falsified its revenue. The short report checks out, and the CEO's only response to it was to post memes. Which means that he's hoping for retail fools to come save him, and knows that if he said anything of substance he would just reveal how accurate the report was.

The tech he presented to my school today was quite amazing.  Completly new strategies to fight cancer.  They will make so much money 💰   The timline works out that the engineers have had enough time to learn how to use the biologists data. Informatics has greatly sped this up.  Its located in Boston along with hundred of other biotechs.  Bullish $BIIB  It's a good price right now too.

gs0ilq|q8l7gz|q8l7gz|0|So I recently tried to post some info about AMC on WSBs showing how the local AMC theater where I live had about 5 people total for the Bond opening premier. Apparently you all can’t handle any criticism or truth so it was just taken down for no reason. I find it so interesting that people who complain about the financial system being rigged and being the underdogs will then take down posts that show anything that goes against the narrative of which stocks they like. I have avoided all possible words that would get the post removed by auto mods. So if it’s removed again then it’s just more roof of how WSBs is basically full of the exact same people who you all seem to be against. Either accept truth or silence it, the theater was nearly empty. That’s a fact. And it doesn’t care about your options calls or investments.|2021-10-15 14:45:31
