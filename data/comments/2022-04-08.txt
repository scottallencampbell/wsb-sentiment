14yctx|nvs38y|nvs38y|57|Not much doing in stock futures: Dow and S&P are flat, with Nasdaq and Russell up about 0.2%. That‚Äôs as of 0625.  It‚Äôs the third day in a row of this. Third and last, as tomorrow we finally get the long-awaited inflation report that should provide some direction. Expectations are for the CPI to come in at 4.7%, an increase from the 4.2% seen in April. You don‚Äôt need me to tell you that a 5% rise in consumer prices is a significant figure. Whether it‚Äôs transitory is another question.  We just had producer prices in China come in higher than anticipated, driven by a rise in commodity prices, though that country‚Äôs CPI is apparently below forecasts. I say ‚Äòapparently‚Äô because Chinese data.  The S&P remains below its all time high of May 7. Just 0.3% lower, but probably too much to make up today given the lack of catalysts.  The meme party appears to be shifting a bit. AMC was flat yesterday and is down 5% in the pre-market. Clover Health doubled yesterday and is up another 12% in the pre-market. Contextlogic gained 50% yesterday and is up another 27% at the time of this recording. Wendy‚Äôs rallied 25% yesterday. Why Wendy‚Äôs and not McDonald‚Äôs or Burger King? Only the meme gods know.   That‚Äôs all I got today. Happy Hump Day.|2021-06-09 05:39:30

160og9|nvs38y|nvs38y|12|Before we get all TLRY to the moon, the goal today is really to close above 21, maybe even 21.5 or 22. Everything else is gravy. Let it build for a few more days, continue the trend, put pressure on the shorts that clearly keep adding to their position. This one will make a serious move, I believe, but it's going to take some more fundamentals to kick in. Just my 2 cents|2021-06-09 10:58:58

166aa5|nvs38y|nvs38y|10|A note about UWMC.   Choppy day for a lot of stocks, but UWMC will close green with a very solid percentage gain.   It‚Äôs consolidating and will build a new floor at $10. Not what you wanted if you bought a bit higher, but shorts doubled down. Again, this is just a single day.   $10 is still big though. Closing above $10 by June 18th, the gamma squeeze probability rises greatly with over 100k options ITM. We may even hit higher strike prices this week and next.   Everything is looking good for a solid move up as the vice tightens on the shorts. No panic.|2021-06-09 11:36:04

Well, I still believe in CLOV and think it has room to grow today, but I cashed in yesterday before close at about $4 above ATH.  WISH hasn't even reached passed ATH yet.  With the increased exposure and visibility brought to the stock through our pals here, I think the mid-term outlook could be good and bring up beyond or around that previous ATH.  P.S. Might be worth mentioning that selling my CLOV options yesterday evening missed me out on the AH opportunity to make \~3.5x instead of \~2x.|2021-06-09 08:26:51

15ejw6|nvs38y|nvs38y|7|"Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There‚Äôs a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands."  - warren buffett  Screw pumpkins and mice!|2021-06-09 08:22:45

15znxp|nvs38y|nvs38y|21|Days like today are a prime example of why institutional investors and the SEC want pattern day trader restrictions on retail investors, and it makes me furious knowing a bunch of people here couldn't exit a position while shorts fucked them.   They know many retail investors can't day trade, so they ease off the downward pressure and even use low volume premarket to drive up prices and get retail to FOMO in right before they use high frequency trading of shorts to absolutely drill. Retail traders with calls and no day trades are then left with worthless options, and if they do have trades left they'll likely paper hand because that money means more to most retail traders.  We have 10 million users here. Someone with more than two braincells and preferably some knowledge on the subject specifically should start a well thought out change.org petition and call on the SEC to remove PDT "protections."|2021-06-09 10:52:22

If we take a look on Bloomberg Terminal, the current SI of $WISH is currently sitting at an ASTOUNDING 48.67%.     HFs are now trying their best to double down and push the price of $WISH down.  We should not panic sell.     [as we can see from this image $WISH is sitting on 48.67&#37; SI ](https://preview.redd.it/kpexyoj6u8471.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b93d07317efb2357fba878cb5c9c23aec0e76438).  48.67%!!!!|2021-06-09 15:14:02

Find its heartbeat. Look at industry heat maps and research the companies on them. Find the big players, or companies with good consistent earnings. Start with the basics. Look back at charts on the max view. Look for patterns. FFS if you come on here and throw your hard earned money at stocks that people are spamming on here you are going to lose in the long run.

16cwck|nvs38y|nvs38y|8|It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.        So, how to deal with fear?        Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.        Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.        Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!|2021-06-09 12:19:50

Not long ago, I was having grand mal seizures withdrawing off benzos. I was in a rehab being woken up to have my vitals taken. Thankful for when my father told me he thought I had permanent brain damage from the drugs and wouldn't give me a birthday card with money in it in case I used it to OD. Thankful for every gun to my head, pistol whip, assault, set-up, robbery, and home invasion. Karma has taken care of all those people, showing me vengeance is a fool's game.        Without all that I wouldn't be where where I am today. Full of gratitude. Don't linger on mistakes, only what you can change going forward. Don't concern yourself with the people hurting you, except as fuel to grow. Don't let these motherfuckers stop you. A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of a sheep.     tl;dr; WEN WEN WEN WEN WEN WEN WEN|2021-06-09 10:17:31

15icbf|nvs38y|nvs38y|11|Posted this yesterday and I got downvoted‚Ä¶ guess I was kinda right. Tlry going to $24 today  Yo so this is my analysis of TLRY and why I think it‚Äôs bullish:    1 year+ chart: Just apply the Fibonacci curve. We are way below 38% and got lots to run. We should easily be able to hit $25 and have a run for $30+ (IMO either end of this week or beginning of the next week unless fed tapering screws us or GME ER takes the whole sector down)  1-3 month chart: looks extremely bullish. Key resistances at $20.50 -$21.00 and $30. Strong support at $14, $17 -$18. Overall, bulls are in charge. Growing 4% a day steadily past 2 weeks with maybe 1 Rex day.   1 week chart: we‚Äôve been able to hold the $18 support and forming a new one around $19.90-20.10 range. We are slowly breaking down the $21 wall that was created back in Jan-Feb. in past 3 days we have hit $20.50-$21.00 range over 4 times and bounced back. But you can tel that it‚Äôs looking bullish because while we are bouncing back at the same ceiling price, the support price is steadily increasing. This creates an ascending triangle and is a sign of a strong bull coming up|2021-06-09 08:52:06

16wza5|nvs38y|nvs38y|11|$WKHS is at 45% short interest of free float with 95% utilization. It's the number one shorted stock right now and has heavy call volume. Don't believe me, look it up. This could be bigger than AMC and options are still very cheap. It just dipped right now so great buying opportunity. Possibly the last opportunity to get in under $20. Once it starts moving, we'll see $30 in no time.|2021-06-09 14:35:30

17bdrq|nvs38y|nvs38y|9|AMC below $47 is a panic sell zone. This is where the true diamond handed apes get separated from the paper hands.  No day trades. No stop losses. We are proving we can hold stupid high, then eventually the "rational" bearish hedge fund investors will withdrawal their cash, and us "retard apes" win big.   AMC is the inverse of a standard investment and that's why it's so damn effective. Us apes can live happily without excessive money while the top 1% would literally kill themselves if they take too much of a loss.

16147m|nvs38y|nvs38y|5|PSA for big dick ballers üíéüíéüíéüíéüíé  TLRY1 options are trading at a 50% discount to regular TLRY options. Most people don't know the difference but if you have the ability to buy in, this is a huge arbitrage opportunity. I'll explain:  When Aphria merged with Tilray, all aphria options were converted into TLRY1 options.  100 TLRY1 options = 83 TLRY options (aka there should only be a 17% reduction in price for a TLRY1 option with the same terms)  Here's the rub. There isn't a 17% reduction in these options rn.... They're almost half the price!!  Robinhood doesn't let you buy TLRY1 but if you have the ability to buy it on your platform, fucking do it, otherwise you're spending 100% more for 20% larger returns on the same option.

16hefe|nvs38y|nvs38y|5|I just posted about weed stocks not too long ago and some folks were joking that I was selling, so I wanted to provide some details on my picks:  After the merger with Aphria, TLRY and CGC are the 2 companies best poised to dominate the US markets when congress decriminalizes, which I strongly believe they will do in the lead up to the midterm elections next year. ACB is also well positioned and CRON will AT LEAST become a takeover target. MSOS and YOLO rep massive amounts of cannabis holdings (inlcuding some of the stocks I listed, but largely Blackrock Holdings)  I like meme stocks. It's exciting to get up and buy and sell every day, taking long shots. But the stocks I listed above are not long shots, IMO. They will be the big 4 investments of the next decade, like tech companies in the last 3 decades.  **Not a financial advisor. Just a stoner who makes poor choices in life.**|2021-06-09 12:50:02

I would sell if you haven‚Äôt already. NVDA is on the move the 4-1 stock split happens next week‚Ä¶ and there will definitely be a run up. This WISH shit very disappointing..

As the price goes higher, the delta rises, causing the options to rise, further perpetuating the stock price.  This event should end by options expiry June 18th  Edit: fixed my misunderstanding of delta.|2021-06-09 11:09:17

15p9p0|nvs38y|nvs38y|2|I don't know why I don't do this more often. Those with more wrinkles show me why this isn't a good play:  Hypothtical:  Call Option on XYZ cost $2.10/share at $10/share so -$210   Market Price is $15  Time to expire is 1 week.   Sell Call option now at $4.60/share +$460  Sell and take $250 Profit and buy 16 shares with house money.   This avoid the option going out of the money next week and becoming worthless, you cover your cost, and when you sell the actual shares, even if it has gone down, you still profit. If it goes up, you make more profit. I see the only detraction here is now your multiple is 16 instead of 100 if it goes up for the exchange of protecting profit.   Is it just a matter of how Bullish you are?|2021-06-09 09:41:32

16ldtt|nvs38y|nvs38y|2|I have a question as a tarded ape who's been at this for about a year now, but is paying closer attention this week for the first time in a few months-   What determines when a stock's price has many fractions of cents on its current value vs stocks that are a full real amount of cents?  So one stock's price will be $17.25 and another stock's price is $17.32579. What determines the difference and why is one seemingly exact and the other seemingly rounded to the nearest real full penny?  I ask because when purchasing additional stocks it seems like it makes it easy to buy full exact stocks of one company while being forced to buy fractional amounts of stocks for another.|2021-06-09 13:17:27

Again, not to FUD but the Apes have been doing its DD and have **REPEATEDLY warned all Apes that CITADEL is one of the BIGGEST investor of CLOV.** Just **recently Citadel increased their investment in CLOV to cause market disruption** **to distract us Apes from AMC going above $70**.   Once AMC breaks $70 all bets are off we are going to rally to its next level of $145 - $150 and go up from there.  This is what These hedgies like Citadel are really scared and preventing from happening.   Its UNDENIABLE that there's INCREASING FUDS and distractions from News and Social media outlets, THIS IS A STRONG INDICATOR THAT WE APES ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK FOR THE MOASS.  Just be very careful and do your own DD as not to get burned by Citadel. This is not a financial advice.   Much Love!|2021-06-09 10:19:11

16u8wr|nvs38y|nvs38y|1|Seems like a good time to think about Virgin Galactic:  Blue Origin‚Äôs New Sheppard launch coming soon is pretty big news in the space industry. Similar to SpaceX‚Äôs successful launches, if that launch is successful, it will likely move Virgin Galactic (SPCE) up a notable amount.  Some people might think that they are competitors so shouldn‚Äôt it be the other way? But the companies have very different launch systems, and short and long term goals. Additionally, in this sector, even if they were comparable, successful launches just increase the public‚Äôs trust and support in the industry as a whole. Which is why the support for BO, VG, and SpaceX tend to move together despite BO and SpaceX being private companies.  Virgin galactic also recently had its own successful manned space launch. And with more announcements about their future launches and ramped up PR, I think it‚Äôs a pretty promising investment. Plus the company is about at about half of its all time high, so we know it has room to grow.|2021-06-09 14:17:01

Reality is starting to set in especially with inflation blasting off and a likely taper of fed purchasing around the corner (interest rates will be rising soon too). The big drop is coming any day now. I could see the CPI #s being outrageous again and causing a severe selloff. If not, then FOMC meeting minutes next week where tapering will be strongly discussed.

1657c9|nvs38y|nvs38y|-7|WISH DD (Post keeps getting removed)  I did extensive research on WISH last night, and predicted today's drop (I can show positions if necessary).        I know this isn't what everyone wants to hear, but please read my DD before jumping to conclusions.        From my DD: Yesterday (and from screenshots today too) the Bloomberg terminal made a mistake on Float (public shares available). Yesterday's volume was extremely high. During several minutes, there was around 7 million in 1 minute and low volatility.        7mil/66mil means nearly 11 percent of shares being actively traded in a minute and still that low volatity? Impossible if the float is actually 66mil.        On top of that, previous SI reported (before float mishap) was around 8 to 12 percent. 8 to 12 percent of true float (assuming Bloomberg is wrong would be 275 mil) is around the 48 percent of 66 mil reported. That means that Bloomberg calculated the same shorts for a lower float.        On top of that, there's absolutely no evidence of any float shrinkage. Float shrinkage can be caused by a few reasons, but a 275 mil to 66 mil without any SEC or media evidence is impossible. I know people aren't going to be happy to hear this, but WISH wasn't the short squeeze we thought it was.        DD on CLNE has already been posted, so I won't go too far in depth, but CLNE open interest for options at a strike price of 10 and 13 is 19k and 32k respectively. This leads to very sizable gamma squeeze potential before 6/18. I've taken my profits from WISH and am moving to CLNE for the potential gamma squeeze rocket ship coming in the next week.        Not financial advice.|2021-06-09 11:29:00

Molnupiravir is currently undergoing a Phase 3 clinical trial for treating COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with at least one risk factor. If molnupiravir is granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration, Merck will receive about $1.2 billion to supply the government with 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir. The company expects to have more than 10 million courses of therapy by the end of 2021.
