3w7uw0|tz0295|tz0295|36|On mornings like this, when the market fades, you look at yourself in the mirror and realize you're fading, too. Those white flecks in your beard, the smile lines on your forehead, the small but constant ache in your back. You're only in your mid-30s, so the fade has really just brought you back to flat. You are +/- .01% on your vibrancy, your life's potential. But you know the red days are coming, and it will be a long and slow bleed.  But what's funny is you grant your wife grace you'd never grant yourself. She has gray hairs and smile lines now, too. But you never think of her as fading, as any less beautiful. No, even on her red days or weeks, you view her like a value investor. Buy it and hold. What's your exit strategy? You don't have one. You'll hold her until you die. You proudly tell people about your shares of her. You honor the responsibility of sitting on her board. Even in her worst quarters, she's never missed a dividend payout, and you know she never will.  You should love yourself like you love her. Like she loves you. Believe in upside. Know you aren't collapsing.  You're bull flagging.|2022-04-08 07:57:26

Not a permabear, but the possibility of 50bps hikes, housing market no longer parabolic, energy independence from Russia, low unemployment rate (usually precedes recession), lack of feds brain cells and ability to be flexible because of how long they’ve been printing, and global catalysts popping up like pimples on a 15 year old crotch goblin really make me feel like we are in a long term market bleed.   Bullish case: while all are stated above, banks are poised so much better for housing market this time around than 08, would benefit from increased rate hikes further, tech and biotech could be a safe haven with healthcare, 🅿️utin getting railed by the Ukrainians leading to beneficial ceasefire for the west, another month before next rate hikes, and my 3rd leg looking a teeny bit longer this morning we could be looking at horizontal for a while then slowly reaching toward ATH.

3vxtdx|tz0295|tz0295|3|I'm super curious to see what the equilibrium point is going to be with bonds.  At some point investors, financial institutions and companies are going to start abandoning equities in favor of bonds.   This increased demand will lower yields and cause bonds and equities to balance out but I'm curious how high yields will go before this happens.   Looking at historical information I would conjecture that we have a way to go. The Fed is going to have to raise rates higher than anticipated in order to fight inflation over a longer period of time.   I suspect a very slow bleed in stocks for many months or even years. The correction we need to experience will not be quick.|2022-04-08 06:30:16

3wkdls|tz0295|tz0295|2|This whole thing (looking at treasuries/yields and JPow/Brainard/rest of the Fed talking tough) feels like a scam.  Everybody knows there's no way the US can afford for rates/yields to be near 3% for the long haul.  That will turn into $1 trillion a year (growing fast) in interest costs to the US government, and as the Boomers retire, things will get worse at an accelerating rate with Medicare/SS added.  The only lever to pull is monetization of debt/inflate the debt away.  But they want to try to do it with an inflation rate of 3-4% not 9-10%.  So they're all talking tough and trying to talk away inflation.  They're hoping that by the time the Fed has raised rates to 1.5-1.75% that inflation is down to 4-5% (see Goldman Sachs predicting 4% inflation by year end).  Then they can declare victory and stop raising rates much earlier than markets are pricing in; all of these wild predictions of 10-14 straight rate hikes are not going to happen because there'd be no buyers of Treasuries at sustainable levels.|2022-04-08 09:25:32

3vxx72|tz0295|tz0295|1|The yen is getting crushed again. USD/JPY just blew through 124.  Last time USD/JPY hit 125 was around 2015.  China was forced to devalue the yuan in order to maintain enough spread against a weak yen. The surprise move crashed stock markets world wide.  There are trillions of dollars in highly levered trades that use currency swaps.  If the yen keeps crashing, many forms could get blown up because it is routine to use the yen as a cheap safe haven.  Those hedge funds will have to sell off assets, including stocks, to cover their losses|2022-04-08 06:31:19

3wanf1|tz0295|tz0295|-3|In days long past, a youth enlisted in the British Navy. His time at sea was usually filled with monotonous tasks like scrubbing the poop deck. But one day, a pirate ship from Spain appeared on the horizon. His captain started shouting orders to different senior members of his crew and then he turned to the boy and told him, "boy, go to my quarters and grab my red jacket."   The boy returned with the Captain's jacket, and the captain told the boy to stay close to him as the pirates sailed closer. The captain and the crew were able to defeat the pirates and force them to retreat pretty easily.  The next day, two pirate ships appeared on the horizon. The crew figured it was the pirates from the previous day, but the captain had already started calling orders and the crew faithfully obliged. He once again told the boy to go get his red jacket from his quarters, and to stay close when he returned. This time the pirates boarded the ship and the crew was forced to fight. After the crew had lost three of their own, the captain rigged ye-olden-days moltov cocktail of 100 proof rum and started slinging bottles at the closest pirate ship, causing it to catch fire. This causes the pirates to retreat, as they don't want to lose their ship. But they start shooting at the captain who is now throwing flaming bottles at the other ship.   After the pirates leave, the captain is busy checking the crew, and maintaining order in the ship. The boy doesn't see that the captain has been shot in the arm until that night, when the captain is favoring his off hand. He asks the captain how it is that he was able to handle being shot and attend to all of the affairs of the ship so easily, and how was it nobody even noticed. The captain smiles and says he is old and has lots of life experiences, and he has learned from every mistake. He then tells how his crew was brave enough to follow his exact commands and how with relatively minimal casualties, they were able to ward off the pirates due to their confidence in their captain. He tells the boy that if the crew saw fear in the captain, that they would be fearful and would not have the will to fight. So he uses the red jacket to hide any injuries which might make the crew's resolve faulter. The boy is inspired by his captain and wonders what the captain has lived through and what else he might know...  It was a peaceful week out at sea, but then eventually a ship appeared on the horizon... Then another, and another, and another, and another. The crew now saw 5 pirate ships sailing towards them and starts to panic. The captain is silent. Before addressing his crew, he turns to the boy and says, "Quickly. Go to my quarters and bring me my brown pants."|2022-04-08 08:18:33

3w3su6|tz0295|tz0295|1|I wonder if market makers on big buy call volume days really try to fuck them the next day.  They are forced to buy/sell when they take options trades.  You would think they would try and move opposite or stay flat in a range to collect.  My guess is flat since it’s the easiest to control or manipulate than push the entire market in a direction….  Or do they have any control at all?  Do all the algos work together?  Red pill please|2022-04-08 07:24:42
