14j2hg|i7p679|i7p679|17|Posting this again because people are still confused. FYI potential explanation for SLV price action. They're auctioning off a huge amount of treasuries over the next 3 days and pumping yields ahead of time. We may see PMs drop over the next 3 days actually. I'm thinking this could be priced in so I'm holding my 10/16 $26c.  "The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $48 billion of 3-year notes on Tuesday afternoon. The auction is $10 billion larger than when the U.S. Treasury first started increased the size of their debt sales back in April to finance the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  As part of the concession process, traders will temporarily push yields higher to make them more attractive at purchase ahead of the auction.  The department will auction $48 billion in 3-year notes on Aug. 11 and $38 billion in 10-year notes on Aug. 12. They government will also sell $26 billion in 30-year bonds on Aug. 13. The department also announced a $6 billion increase to the auction sizes of the 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year note this quarter. Meanwhile, the 7-year note will increase by $9 billion."

13e3i1|i7p679|i7p679|8|The average company beat analyst estimates by 22% ‚Äî way above the historic norm of a 3% beat.  But top-line revenue beat by only 1%.  The huge disparity between topline and bottom-line can be explained simply. Companies have gone on a dramatic cost-cutting initiative, far in excess of analyst expectations, that have significantly boosted bottom-line returns. Cost cutting is taking many forms, but two of the most obvious have been reductions in travel and lower rent, both of which are becoming permanent.  The dark side of good earnings: Companies are talking about turning ‚Äúfurloughs‚Äù into permanent layoffs.  It‚Äôs been a very strange earnings season.  Analysts dramatically underestimated earnings for a good part of the market, particularly industrials, financials, and many technology stocks.  The good news is if and when the economy recovers and revenue growth returns, corporate profits will be even stronger.  The bad news is a lot of people are going to get laid off.  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/companies-are-talking-about-turning-furloughs-into-permanent-layoffs.html  Position in stocks  Apple Amazon Microsoft Facebook google Nvidia MasterCard Netflix Shopify|2020-08-11 07:04:32

140k3o|i7p679|i7p679|15|Doesn't even matter if we crack SPY 340 now. Historically markets have almost never had any given index stay green this many days.  Last time this happened this year we all know what June 11th did. Today is a similar market pattern to June 8th. Bond Yields soar, Industrials & Oil flying. Tech sells off. Metals sell off. SPY hits a big peak. Big fake hope that the economy is recovering.  But the financial truth is that with no stimulus we are facing a deflationary crisis that could be very very bad. Local governments could even fail. Airlines, Hotels, Theaters, Cruises, ect all suffering long term pain with no bailouts. Mortgages, Rent will go unpaid as $300 on unemployment isn't enough and most are close to exhausting their State funds anyway.  Stimulus is the only way we prevent the deepest recession since 2008 and the market seems to not care that we are in that much jeopardy. This is WITHOUT Covid having a second wave this winter.   It fucking hurts but im averaging down on my long plays.  üåà üêª. Better to fucking short at ATH right?|2020-08-11 10:49:27

It never quite plays out in your favour, and most of the time it doesn't work out at all. You get the occasional runner, but even that doesn't cover your losses on the other earnings plays. Best way to play earnings is to buy the run up, and sell 2 days before the announcement.  Sometimes you get unlucky and earnings might leak before hand, or lucky, depends on the results, which is why I don't hold till the last day. Yes you don't get the IV bounce, but trust me, I'm saving y'all a bunch of money regardless. Take it from a person that's blown up his 5k account to earnings. Gl autists|2020-08-11 09:01:22

14lwt1|i7p679|i7p679|7|   here is an ER this afternoon that is under the radar:  $VIAV  They make cool optical shit that helps prevent counterfit money, face recognition cameras, and self-driving cars. They also do a ton in Fiber Optics / networking.... all the cloud companies that are raging have had to upgrade infrastructure and thats where these guys have done well the last quarter. Checkout their IR deck: [https://s22.q4cdn.com/132839763/files/doc\_presentations/2020/Viavi-Solutions-Inc-2020-Needham-Growth-Conference-Jan-2020-FINAL.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/132839763/files/doc_presentations/2020/Viavi-Solutions-Inc-2020-Needham-Growth-Conference-Jan-2020-FINAL.pdf) had good earnings and revenue growth over last several years.  But here is the cake - Someone bought about $150k in call options yesterday (which is huge for this company) - check out their UOA. I suspect they are announcing something big or killing their quarter when they have their call in 2 hours.

13ccv0|i7p679|i7p679|6|Why is Putin's announcement so important? Two reasons:  1- They literally stole the vaccine from AZN and then they decided to sign a deal with AZN. AZN is the only company Europe funded with billions of euros. They also admitted that this vaccine would be on a non-profit basis. No insider sell-offs on pretty much every AZN news unlike MRNA and JNJ. So this vaccine is from AZN, not from Russia itself.  2- Russia dealt with Chernobyl, a much deadlier disaster than COVID, by sending naked miners to dig a hole under a nuclear plant, sending thousands on soldiers to clean the area etc. I think Russia took a bit of extreme steps to test the vaccine on its own people.  But all could be wrong though but I highly doubt it.|2020-08-11 06:41:28

14n5ds|i7p679|i7p679|4|Lowering my SLV cost basis.   I suspect it's a fear combo of vaccine news and stimulus discussions stalling out. Increased perceived risk in the near term, since a huge reduction in gov't spending would certainly be a catalyst for a silver/gold decline. I can also understand the rotation out of silver/gold and into cyclicals, since they are perceived to be less risky via being near the bottom already + positive(ish?) vaccine news. Ultimately, I still believe people are way overly optimistic about a vaccine near EOY / early 2021. There will most likely be a second wave and possible another round of (shorter) lockdowns well before we are anywhere near having a vaccine manufactured en masse.   Short sighted investors are getting shaken out - I view it as a decent opportunity to lower my cost basis. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. Not a huge deal if your portfolio isn't fucking 50% silver lmao. Feel for those with shorter term calls.   Either way, as far as speculation goes, I still think PMs are a pretty good ***bet*** in a 6-12+ months time horizon. The problem is too many people here view it as a sound investment or got caught up thinking it's a sure thing. I think you should only be in PMs if you are knowingly speculating on macro events or hedging against inflation, in which case it should be a small % of your portfolio.|2020-08-11 13:44:23

13bf3v|i7p679|i7p679|3|Wrote this out for a specific reply but because everyone is talking about the Russian vaccine, I thought it might be helpful to post again:  US and other countries also could have started deploying a vaccine right now if they wanted to. From a technical standpoint, we are just as far along as Russia; products designed, manufacturing process designed, product manufacturing well under way.  Only reason Russia 'crossed the finish line' first is because they condensed and relaxed the regulatory process (especially clinical testing) to the extreme. In doing so, they are arguably being negligent in the safeguarding of their citizens' health by pushing a vaccine out the door that may not work, and may have unexpected health issues. This would not only be problematic in terms of the direct health impact of an unsuitable vaccine, but would also severely damage public trust in vaccines and therapeutics deemed safe and effective by the Russian government. Such a failure would also likely send international shockwaves both in the markets and in terms of public trust in vaccines (covid vaccines and in general).  Also, drugs are not given approval in the US if another government approves them in their own country; it has to go through the US regulatory process (meaning clinical testing will have to be done here). That is generally the case around the world as well. So there will not be a mass distribution of this vaccine beyond Russia, at least for now.|2020-08-11 06:28:16

14h8gt|i7p679|i7p679|3|FYI potential explanation for SLV price action. They're auctioning off a huge amount of treasuries over the next 3 days and pumping yields ahead of time. We may see PMs drop over the next 3 days actually. I bought the SLV "dip" but I'm kinda scared now.  "The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $48 billion of 3-year notes on Tuesday afternoon. The auction is $10 billion larger than when the U.S. Treasury first started increased the size of their debt sales back in April to finance the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  As part of the concession process, traders will temporarily push yields higher to make them more attractive at purchase ahead of the auction.  The department will auction $48 billion in 3-year notes on Aug. 11 and $38 billion in 10-year notes on Aug. 12. They government will also sell $26 billion in 30-year bonds on Aug. 13. The department also announced a $6 billion increase to the auction sizes of the 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year note this quarter. Meanwhile, the 7-year note will increase by $9 billion."

13qmzk|i7p679|i7p679|4|~~Even before the opening bell, Monday looked ugly~~.Tuesday overnight United States markets reached near all time highs on Russian vaccine news.  But ~~by the time~~ hours after the bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange, six and a half frantic hours later, ~~$1.2 trillion~~ $3 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market.  Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor ‚Äî the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.  As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid hit economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.  ‚ÄúYou just felt like the world was unraveling,‚Äù Ryan Larson, the firm‚Äôs senior equity trader, said. ‚ÄúPeople started to sell and they sold hard. It didn‚Äôt matter what you had ‚Äî you sold.‚Äù Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.  At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.  Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined Monday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary ~~Henry M. Paulson Jr.~~ Steven Terner Mnuchin¬†and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of ~~a bailout~~ Stimulus.  _______   *You get the idea*|2020-08-11 09:17:00

145vwy|i7p679|i7p679|4|Puts on Russia? At best their vaccine doesn't work, at worst it kills people. They skipped Phase 3, so all they know is it works in theory and it didnt kill a few hundred people in the first few weeks.   One thing everybody should realize: you only get 1 chance at a vaccine. People wont take a 2nd vaccine, so its better to be right than first.|2020-08-11 11:30:04
14al3q|i7p679|i7p679|4|Let's see news about Russia releasing their vaccine is finally mainstream even though it's been buzzing around for a bit. The USA has been spending billions working on pretty much the exact same technology with the only difference being Russia sped up the process and skipped a few more steps. The USA is not going to buy a Russian vaccine for one out of spite and for two because the technologies are the same and  billions have been pumped into it already.   My guess is there will be a pissing contest, vaccines in the US will get even further fast tracked as the tech is pretty much the same and if the world accepts Russia's vaccine it's game on .

14vdr8|i7p679|i7p679|2|*Repost but its real now.*  Even before the opening bell, ~~Monday~~ Wednesday looked ugly. But by the time that bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange, six and a half frantic hours later, ~~$1.2 trillion~~ $3 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market.  Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor ‚Äî the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.  As lawmakers began to vote on a rescue for ~~financial institutions~~ Covid hit economic sectors, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected.  ‚ÄúYou just felt like the world was unraveling,‚Äù Ryan Larson, the firm‚Äôs senior equity trader, said. ‚ÄúPeople started to sell and they sold hard. It didn‚Äôt matter what you had ‚Äî you sold.‚Äù Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.  At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.  Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined Monday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary ~~Henry M. Paulson Jr.~~ Steven Terner Mnuchin¬†and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of ~~a bailout~~ Stimulus.  _______   *You get the idea*|2020-08-11 14:47:35

Let's assume for a second that pinterest is not overvalued. Why the f isn't Etsy valued higher? genuinely curious what you guys think  &#x200B;  edit: pins is 22b market cap|2020-08-11 13:27:09
