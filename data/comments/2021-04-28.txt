w6bduu|n0bepa|n0bepa|28|Mvis today- “With an expected range of 250 meters and a field of view of 100 degrees horizontal by 30 degrees vertical, we expect this lidar sensor to provide the highest resolution point cloud at 10.8 million points per second while operating at 30 hertz. Additionally, this lidar sensor is designed to be immune to interference from sunlight and other lidars. One of the ground breaking proprietary features of this lidar sensor is its capability to output the axial, lateral and vertical velocity of moving objects at 30 hertz,” added Sharma. “We believe no lidar product on the market, ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave to time-of-flight, has this capability. To achieve safety and successful autonomous driving, we believe this capability delivered at low latency will be a key feature.”|2021-04-28 09:25:06

w6mq99|n0bepa|n0bepa|9|Elon did this to himself. He drove up stock prices with crazy autopilot and claims, while the owners know it's just glorified lane assist and parking; with a 10k upcharge because you checked a fsd box.*(Unless your'e one in 1,000,000 that can actually enable the fsd beta).*  Honestly he just doesn't care about the cars anymore. His passion lies more in SpaceX, Neuralink, and Starlink. I bet if you put a CEO in with realistic timelines and actual honesty of how far along the technology is, TSLA would've been blowing past $1k in summer.|2021-04-28 10:46:42

Additionally, this lidar sensor is designed to be immune to interference from sunlight and other lidars. One of the ground breaking proprietary features of this lidar sensor is its capability to output the axial, lateral and vertical velocity of moving objects at 30 hertz,” added Sharma. “We believe no lidar product on the market, ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave to time-of-flight, has this capability. To achieve safety and successful autonomous driving, we believe this capability delivered at low latency will be a key feature  MVIS|2021-04-28 08:39:22

w5pm9z|n0bepa|n0bepa|24|Futures are flat as of 0630. Nothing doing a day after more sideways action for major indices. Earnings results drove moves for individual stocks but there were no catalysts to shift the broader market.  Today is going to be about the Fed. The FOMC interest rate decision and accompanying statement is due at 1400 followed by the Fed press conference at 1430. Interest rates will stay where they are but it’s all about the commentary from Powell & Co.  Investors will be looking for any discussions of tapering and inflation. Last month Powell was able to convince markets (barely) that he was standing pat even with higher consumer prices. Any hint at all that his conviction is wavering will spook markets. Bonds are selling off a bit this morning, perhaps in anticipation, with the 10-year up about 130 bps to 1.64%.  We also have earnings today: Boeing, Ford, Qualcomm, eBay, and MGM Resorts during market hours. Apple and Facebook after the close.  If that weren’t enough we also hear from President Biden tonight, but that news (of higher taxes on capital gains and income for the uber wealthy) is already out, so would not expect there to be much of a market reaction to the speech.   Earnings results have been positive and guidance mostly optimistic, including for consumer names (Starbucks raised its full-year outlook) and reopening plays (airlines are expecting better days ahead. JetBlue did so yesterday). Big picture things are probably set up for us to keep moving higher.|2021-04-28 05:58:16

w67mxh|n0bepa|n0bepa|5|BEES and HEMP vs COTTON Facts.     **Bees** are vital to the production of both conventional and organic **cotton** because of their role as a pollinator. Studies have shown that there are many benefits to **cotton** growth derived from insect pollination. They are linked to increases in **cotton** production, seed production and fibre quality.  **Bees** play a significant role in the ecosystem, **pollinating** about one-third of the global food supply. ... **Hemp does** not produce nectar, but **hemp's** impact on **bees** is valuable because the crop produces a large amount of pollen. When other crops are not available, **bees** can **pollinate hemp**.  HERE'S THE THANG,  It's time we heavily invest in HEMP, not only to save the bees but also for the survival of cotton.

To achieve safety and successful autonomous driving, we believe this capability delivered at low latency will be a key feature.” MVIS today  Guys this is big. Autonomous driving is the future of EV.

w6869l|n0bepa|n0bepa|6|Same story every time.  Stock beats big time, pops after-hours and then sells off at the open.  Over the next couple of days it regains and gets to a new high.  Look at AN, LAD and many others.   AMD beat handily and showed that they ate INTC's lunch.  The stock tipped 90 after-hours and now it is struggling to hold a 1% gain because the overall market is selling off or sluggish.    AMD and NVDA are cheap at these levels.  It is only a matter of time before they are the standard for Data Centers and continue to innovate.  AMD is working on the next 5 year plan and INTC is struggling to figure out how it got killed from all angles.  (Apple goes to it's own chips, AMD takes share in Data Centers, their technology is not competitive anymore and they have supply chain issues.)|2021-04-28 09:00:39

w6y6w5|n0bepa|n0bepa|13|For anyone that got in MVIS again back at 20-23 be VERY CAREFUL because after earnings there may be a huge sell off happening again. The price to buy back in should be $14-$16. Fidelity is very bearish on MVIS as well despite beating earnings 3 times in a row. It's expected. They NEED to unexpectedly surpass shareholder expectations tomorrow. If they don't - you'll see a drop. Don't get in yet. Be patient. If it goes up, it's a better buy in this scenario than buying high and being stuck in the low. Not all shooting stars that drop are worth catching. It's also good to buy on the way up so play it safe.|2021-04-28 12:04:58

w6ylbv|n0bepa|n0bepa|10|   "Jerome Powell, nervously wringing his hands together, reluctantly steps in front of the podium. He squints hard as he tries to gain his bearings. Were the fluorescent lights always this bright? He couldn't remember. The recording lights on camera rigs 3, 4, and 5 snap sharp salutes as they blink on, signaling to his guts to twist in abject horror of what was to come. His assistant flashes a meek thumbs-up to Jerome from the safety of the darkness behind the cabal of unblinking observers. As he stares at his note card with the desperation-filled eyes of a drowning swimmer silently pleading with a lifeguard who doesn't see him, his vision becomes occluded; a combination of his forehead perspiration and tears.    Unable to come to grips with the report to be, he instead pulls out his engraved Federal Reserve lighter. He gives a weak smile to his trusty tool, which he used to set fire to the value of the US dollar. But, that smile quickly contorts into a grimace of pain as he immolates himself in front of a captive audience. Unable to scream, he is slowly mummified by the super-heated wrappings of his polyster suit. As he is slowly shrink-wrapped to the floor, he drops his note card. As if it delights in the macabre display before it, the card flits playfully to and fro, before landing daintily at an angle before the the cameras, proudly displaying its written contents as a badge of honor: "Today, we're raising interest rates by 0.001%."   Inhuman shrieks sound from the crowd, as the conflagration spreads to the rest of the building. Every single adult in the country is rendered jobless and homeless, as the dollar's value plunges to negative one million. Every portfolio is flash-liquidated in a chorus of cacophonic panic. SPY closes the day at $7. GME blasts off to three million per share for some fucking reason.|2021-04-28 12:07:44

Keep this in mind; we just saw SPY/S&P hold up through March due to value rotation.  If there is a big selloff on growth stocks, it shouldn't tank SPY.

w7nc8j|n0bepa|n0bepa|4|Can somebody explain the Cohen / e-commerce pivot resurgence to me, and how GME will actually do well long-term?    Yes GME absolutely needs to get into ecommerce to even stand a chance of surviving. But even if they are wildly successful at selling video game disks online in the next couple years, nobody will be buying physical disks in the (not-so-distant) future. In fact new consoles all have a diskless version that is rapidly growing in popularity, as is console-less videogame streaming. Does anybody really believe physical videogame disks won’t go the way of the CD/DVD??   Who cares about successfully transitioning to e-commerce if there’s no longer any product for GME to sell in 10 years? This seems completely different than Chewy where there’s no digital form of petfood taking over... if there were I’d imagine chewy would also be screwed as the digital petfood producers would themselves easily take over distribution.   Has GME/Cohen articulated their business plan for once videogames are fully digital, or have they buried their heads in the sand and assumed used disk sales will remain a large market indefinitely?|2021-04-28 15:00:23

w65w0u|n0bepa|n0bepa|5|Imaging believing MVIS is a good investment when its valued at 1000x EV/Revenue, has had shrinking revenue for the last two years, and hasn't had positive net income for the last 14 years.  At 1000x EV/Revenue they're effectively priced way beyond what any company in their right mind would pay to acquire their technology. Also Elon Musk came out the other day saying LIDAR will not be used on any Teslas because regular high definition camera technology with machine learning is better for fully autonomous driving.   If you're investing in MVIS then you're just playing musical chairs with other Redditors. Basically buying just to sell to the greater fool at a higher price. Eventually when the music stops you're gonna get caught standing up holding a massive bag.|2021-04-28 08:42:33

w6umb9|n0bepa|n0bepa|1|I think $RIOT is a good long play for holding shares. Corn price aside. Per their website:  >*March 2021* \- 2,201 S19 Pro (110 TH/s) miners are received and deployed in Massena, NY. Riot’s mining fleet totals **13,746 miners** with an operational hashing capacity of 1.3 PH/s. 1,500 S19j miners (100 TH/s) are ordered from Bitmain, bringing the total outstanding order to 25,400 miners.   >   >*April – October 2021* \- The publicly announced orders of 25,400 S19 Pro (110 TH/s) and S19j (90/100 TH/s) miners are expected to be received and deployed through October 2021 and are expected to raise Riot’s total operational hash rate capacity to 4 EH/s. Riot expects to then have a fully deployed fleet totaling approximately **39,146 miners**.  They're set to nearly triple their fleet by October. Of course, mining difficulty will increase by then so the increased revenue won't be perfectly linear.|2021-04-28 11:40:22

w7krmo|n0bepa|n0bepa|-10|The price of uranium is going to move from 30 usd per pound to 50 usd by 2024 according to bmo. I am very bullish on uranium in these coming years with plans to move to cleaner energy. Solar power and wind power are very clean but do not provide the power necessary to rely entirely upon them by 2050. Nuclear power has been very bearish after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima but as that event fades into the past many governments have been looking towards a switch to nuclear power over coal in the coming years. The demand for uranium has been rising steadily as more reactors begin operation which are now putting a strain on the shrinking stockpile of uranium in above ground facilities, the existing mines must expand and grow to meet the new demand once these stockpiles are fully depleted. If the mines don’t keep up with demand the price of uranium will hit the moon. A new uranium mining company is set to ipo on the nyse under the ticker UROY because Wall Street understands that there is a large market that will emerge in the mining sector for uranium in the coming years. I don’t expect anything to move very much in the recent future; however I do think uranium is something to keep my eye on. I am looking at $CCJ which owns a mine in cigar lake, Saskatchewan. This mine was closed at the beginning of the pandemic in December 2020 and reopened this month. It accounts for 13% of the global output of uranium. This company seems to know what they are doing as they have seen tons of growth long term and remain a very competitive company in the uranium market despite global catastrophe. I want to see what everyone else thinks about the uranium market in case I might be on to something.|2021-04-28 14:42:36
