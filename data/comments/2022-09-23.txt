I know it wasn‚Äôt around during the Great Recession.   The only crashes that I can think of that even come remotely close to this in the timeframe this sub  has existed are the 2018 taper tantrum and the covid crash. Taper tantrum went on for 4 months, with relatively modest declines, and the rebound was nice and steady thereafter. Covid crash was incredibly violent but also very fast, to the point where you could see the beginning and end of it within a month.    This is an epic crash on par with the covid crash,  drawn out for roughly 11 months now.

How do you have a soft landing from a massive asset bubble? House prices went up 50% in 2 years.  Stocks did the same.  Bonds have been the mother of all bubbles the past decade.  How do you undo that without a hard landing?  Governments printed trillions and inflation is stuck in the 8-9% range.  Food prices and rents skyrocketing.  Even new cars still going up fast.  We needed a hard landing to undo the mess of the last 2 years; it will be painful to see stocks return to reasonable valuations, but when they do there will be lots of good buying opportunities.

Timing the market/trading was never worth my sleep and time in hindsight. I dedicated three years and sit flat in my portfolio. On the contrary I learned a lot about markets. I do not regret the gains and losses made.  It took time to sink in but I understand now that beating the market is difficult and most will not be able to do it. It‚Äôs like a game of  cat and mouse trading markets.  Case in point: My time trading wasn‚Äôt really worth the stress/anxiety. Focusing on every bit of doomer news and reacting to it. I‚Äôll invest in VTI and call it quits. I‚Äôll still check in on the board to see the loss/gain porn.  Was fun whilst it lasted. Three years roller coaster. It‚Äôs back to the day job and reality.

If I want to hold a share for a very long time and I believe it will grow long-term, here is what I think would be a good idea:  Stock has a price of 10$ at the moment. I think it will be worth at least 20$ in the future. For a better buy in I would sell puts at base price 12, 13 and 14$ within a timeframe of more then a year and buy 300 shares at 10$ with the premium and a little bit more.  Since it's a sold put, I am obligated to buy at those prices even if the price of the share stayed at 10$, making it an average price of 11,50$.  If the price of the stock went up to the sold put prices my shares would be worth more so I only would need to sell a bit of those to buy back in, resulting in more shares with a higher average price. If the price went downhill I would be in a loss only if I don't have the money to buy those puts.  Is this a regarded strategy or did I find a way to print money at low risk?|2022-09-23 07:05:25pl66pk|xlt9h6|xlt9h6|-3|real shit:  if i wax my ass crack, you think i could sell booty pics online üò≤|2022-09-23 07:07:35pl994f|xlt9h6|xlt9h6|-2|Market is shit...but I am seeing good prices on crypto for those willing to really diamond hand on the long term.|2022-09-23 07:38:32pm0lwp|xlt9h6|xlt9h6|-3|This is amazing, I‚Äôm buying some NVDA and GOOG at market close if this keeps dipping.
