The story is still the same there: watch for concerns about inflation and bond yields and speculation around normalizing rates.  We do have February retail sales data today at 0830. Expectations there are for a slight decline, but there were seasonal issues (cold weather, Texas mess) that affected things. Besides, now that consumers have their stimulus checks the backward-looking measure is much less important.  Should be another slow day, though can expect there to be some buying more out of boredom than anything else (see yesterday)|2021-03-16 05:44:50

Begging your stock as you stare at it for hours sometimes help but it‚Äôs not reliable for sustained growth. Petting your cat will make the stock moon but ONLY if the cat comes to you, if you seek out the cat and pet it it will be a red day.

r4kqro|m65k4x|m65k4x|7|Congrats to everyone who bought/held NVDA, AMD, VIAC, SBUX and a few other Naz names.   NVDA and AMD will revisit their previous highs and I think SBUX has a long way to go due to the reopen trade.  Although I love VIAC, I have started to trim my position.  I still see good momentum for it to push higher but I needed to book some profits.  The overall market will push higher. I believe we see 10% on the S&P which should help lots of stocks.  We are in some pretty euphoric times now but it is clear we have room to keep going up for now.   A time will come when all this comes crashing so you should start to think about how you position for it.  The more cash you have at that time the more you can bet against the market and buy some super cheap stocks like we did during the pandemic.  My recommendation is to get and stay long until we get to 440 on the SPY.|2021-03-16 09:40:42

You can also tell its manipulation quite easily. Nobody trying to offload would dump at marketprice. They would be killing their own profits. If you are genuinely selling large amounts of shares, you would do it gently and carefully. This sort of dumping is for one reason Ans one reason alone.   They are betting people will get tired, and drop the shares.  If you do this, they can still win.  However, if you dont.... And lets say buy more at the dips. OR keep holding. The price will come up again very quickly in a few days.  Depending on how much we buy, theyll be way more fucked after this than before|2021-03-16 05:44:42

r5b1uw|m65k4x|m65k4x|4|To anyone that actually understands economics:  Bond yields rising and the threat of stagflation are impacting the markets, but wouldn't it be wise for investors to actually *keep* money in the market because equities should continue to remain inflated? The sectors that are supposedly inflationary hedges are also pretty red. It doesn't seem likely that so many people are rushing to 10 and 20 year bonds because of such a marginal increase that it would so drastically impact the market.  Why the fuck is everything getting wrecked? Shouldn't the market benefit, or at least be relatively unaffected, by inflation? The SP 500 still cancelled out inflation during the hyperinflation from 69-80, so why the fuck is everything tanking in this case?|2021-03-16 12:55:58

r5bg40|m65k4x|m65k4x|21|You know that scene in war movies where one of the main characters has his body blown up, and he's laying on the ground dying with his intestines hanging out?    And his friends run up and prop up his head and he always asks "how bad is it? I'm gonna make it, right?" But none of his friends have the heart to tell him he's absolutely fucked so they just say "of course, buddy. We'll get you patched up and soon you'll be home with your wife and kids while everyone calls you a hero!"   That's what I think of whenever I read about someone holding some $400+ GME shares, asking shit like "you apes coming to get me, right?!" And all the replies are "of course, apes strong together! We'll get you on our way to $100k/share and then we'll all be enjoying tendies on the moon!!"|2021-03-16 12:58:51

I sold, at 271 yesterday, because I could see it going down. Am I buying back in? Absolutely when the bleeding has stopped. Would I gain anything by holding? Absolutely fucking not.

r4ttzs|m65k4x|m65k4x|14| Just under 6% of all U.S. mortgages ‚Äî 2.7 million homes ‚Äî were in some stage of delinquency at the end of November, according to the latest reading by CoreLogic.   The largest share of troubled mortgages are those that are considered seriously delinquent, or more than 90 days past due. Just under 4% are in this deep trouble, compared with just over 1% the previous year.  The number of loans in forbearance had been dropping swiftly but now appears stuck in the low 5% range, signaling that most of these borrowers are unable to get current again. The number of those who are exiting forbearance is also being offset by newly troubled borrowers.   I know most of you zoomers don't understand what's happening but let me explain. Mommy got forbearance (extensions to foreclosure), but Mommy has no way of paying when forbearance ends so mommy is goin to have to sell the house to pay off the loan. but there are 2.7 million homes just like mommys so when we all have to pay our loans there will be a flood of supply, when this happens mommy's house is going to lose 1/4 of it's value and we won't be able to pay back the loan. When this happens mommy declares bankruptcy and banks go boom.   Not to mention all the new home purchases for way too much money that will lose a lot of value, now they can't sell and are stuck in house with big loan! nothing really matters and the cycle repeats|2021-03-16 10:49:46

r4jwgi|m65k4x|m65k4x|19|Thought about setting up a throwaway for this as I'm sure I will get downvoted to oblivion but oh well.  I've been part of the GME movement since January getting caught in the hype buying in multiple times until I averaged out at $275. Not a massive problem as all I was seeing was green and when we hit $450 I'd doubled my money (If I sold). Like all the other "apes" I did not sell and held through the massive short attacks and restricted trading I thought it was a temporary dip. I held all my shares all the way back down to $40 to see them go all the way back up to $350 this time around, not learning my lesson from last time, I ended up averaging up from $275 to $330 just before the next short attack hit.  Since then all I've seen is DD to tell me I'm clever and to keep on holding, I've had multiple chances to sell with only a 10% loss but today I finally stopped believing I've sold for a massive 46% loss because I no longer believe that this is going where we want it to.  The problem with this stock now its become a cult movement every bad word said is seen as a personal attack. Im lucky enough that although pissed off a 46% loss isn't going to financially ruin me but others are holding onto this stock blindly following every piece of "DD".  Some people are going to loose a lot of money, I know the FOMO I've been through it enough times but ask yourselves are you willing to loose possibly 90%+ of what you essentially gambling with? If not cut your losses while you still can, remember you're up against billion dollar hedge funds here, you don't even exist of their radar.|2021-03-16 09:34:11

r4rf0b|m65k4x|m65k4x|3|Flat and low volume because the big moves are coming tomorrow with the conclusion of the FOMC meeting. I really don't see how this is anything but bearish. And with SPY near 400 it's the perfect round number to create the top and start dumping. If JPOW and homies say rates will be raised earlier than expected (2023 perhaps as new target or even late 2022) as many think could happen, I think that'll absolutely spook equities and raise bond yields more. If they say literally nothing in our projections has changed, people are going to more concerned about inflation and the fact the Fed is BSing us with those numbers and projections. Wall street is likely to call the Fed's bluff and continue to project higher rates anyways. Either way we dump. Sort of like how any news pumped us in 2020, bad or good. The opposite is going to start happening here because the market will interpret the news the way it sees fit|2021-03-16 10:31:39

Unlike the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, the next initiative, which is expected to be even bigger, won‚Äôt rely just on government debt as a funding source. While it‚Äôs been increasingly clear that tax hikes will be a component -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said at least part of the next bill will have to be paid for, and pointed to higher rates -- key advisers are now making preparations for a package of measures that could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners.|2021-03-16 06:53:04

They don't just build robots. They build better tests that take less time, have less error, and used cheaper materials.     This company is like Fujifilm, SONY, Canon, and Nikon in the early 2000's when digital ended the Kodak era. It's not just making devices...it's innovating our diagnostic standards.     They have been building their physical footprint and continue to work directly with researchers at top universities in the US for optics, chemistry, pathology, and biochemistry.     Their work does not just stop at COVID. They are responsible for streamlining and increasing reliability of standard point of care testing (the stuff they do to figure out what's wrong with you when you show up to the hospital). There are people working on tests to detect everything from infections, to cancer, to concussions.     Just wanted to give a plug to keep this on your watch list. The way I do that is by buying 1-2 shares. So, there you have it, I own 2 shares of this company and am waiting for it to pop.|2021-03-16 09:52:32

r55abn|m65k4x|m65k4x|-1|Starbreeze B = The undervalued company that owns Payday  For those of you who likes to play games you probably heard of Payday. For those of you who don¬¥t all you need to know is that it is currently ranked 37 amongst the most current players on steam (A platform with over 30k games). This is a old game. Payday 2 was released in august 2013. Worth to mention is they recently started updating it again though.  So why am I saying it will go to the stars, well it¬¥s simple:  &#x200B;  1. It is extremly undervalued atm.  Starbreeze B made a horrible walking dead game and after that it¬¥s stock plummeted, like we are talking 90%. Company was indebt, things where looking rough. Well guess what they are debt free now. They are losing less and less money going by their recent reports. And rumors say they are looking to team up with some other studio for Payday 3.  2. Payday 3 hype is gonna be insane.  Now if you don¬¥t like the idea of betting on something like a potential game realease you can stop reading now this is not for you. If being a gamer has taught me something it¬¥s that trailers benefit sales insanely well. Honestly better then the actual product. Just to give an example here is the trailer for said game: [https://youtu.be/non\_0jlOXew](https://youtu.be/non_0jlOXew)  This is just an example but it goes to show they know how to make good trailers. On top of that it already has a solid fan base.  3. Payday 2 bear. Okay I lied a bit  Let¬¥s say that Payday 3 is in a distant future. Right, I still think with the dlc and active players base it should be worth a solid 2sek, or roughly 0.3$ a stock. Currently a bit lower.  &#x200B;  Honestly if I did not have 1/3 of my portfolio in it already I would invest more.  I would do a DD but since it¬¥s a penny stock I think it was against the rules right?|2021-03-16 12:13:50

Should I buy to close the contract so I keep my shares?
