51l7gp|ojcfk1|ojcfk1|3|XLNX and AMD are basically the same company at this point, but a XLNX share is supposed to be worth 1.7234 times more than an AMD share once the acquisition is done and the XLNX shares are replaced with AMD shares. However it's only trading at 1.4816 times more than AMD. There's a massive arbitrage opportunity for XLNX shares (roughly 16.32% realized gains at the end by my math, assuming AMD shares don't tumble randomly) and you only have to wait a few months at the most for the acquisition to be done. I'd say go get some while it's still in the red today. This is not professional financial advice, obviously, so do your own research.|2021-07-13 10:06:30

51765f|ojcfk1|ojcfk1|3|It looks like the broad market is slowly but surely losing its fear of inflation- and that's a good thing!    Years of globalization, increasing economies of scale, human capital increases, more efficient supply chains, better capital allocations, technological progress are pushing the trend clearly into deflation.     Just because your hamburger is $0.3 more expensive or your used '99 Honda Civic is $300 instead of $250 it doesn't mean hyperinflation is coming.|2021-07-13 08:11:34

50rkzz|ojcfk1|ojcfk1|22|My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although I lost all my money on the stonk market.|2021-07-13 05:02:41

I ignored it a few weeks ago when I was up $2,500 on a TSLA call, and now I'm down about $750 on it. Well I rode AAPL from $123 to $146.4, and I just had that same feeling that I should sell. So I sold. Probably a big mistake, but I'm glad I took in over a 20% profit. Really need to listen to my gut more in the future.|2021-07-13 09:51:39

If I start a deposit of 1000$ right now, if I buy 1000$ of stock after I start the deposit, does it use the margin money or will it use my deposit ( I believe I get the 1000 for instant buying power)   I tried calling Webull but nobody will pick ip|2021-07-13 11:40:40

The market gains some bullish sentiment again and the stocks you sold go up 20-50% and you decide that the company must be good again so you fomo back in, but by that time you're buying the top.  Rinse & repeat. Congrats retards on being so predictable.|2021-07-13 13:50:52

51uz6a|ojcfk1|ojcfk1|3|I had a nice play in the works today.  Found a small stock, saw it go wild on pre-market, and then cooled off a little bit almost to previous close levels but not quite.  "The second the casino opens you are going to volume the living shit out of that price and go back to that pre-market high or even higher, I believe...I'll check you out!".  CPI kicks in, and she goes down from 5.07 to 4.55...then stays there for a couple seconds...then proceeds to climb like a goat, bouncy at times but always up.  Tried to get in at 4.7, app said "NOPE". Something something margin error something something. I buy with cash only and had plenty, so did not understand, and saw in dismay that she had climbed a little bit more during all that ruckus.  Second try to get in at 4.89. Same error, fail. Tried buying with limit, again at market, nope and nope.  This sucker is already at 5.28 and she's jumping all over the place, but I can see where she is going.  You can see where this goes from there.  Currently at 6.13 (she got to 6.55 when I finally gave up) and she's mocking me.  I saw a play with potential to cash in a quick 35% up in less than 3 hours, I was proven right, yet I had to see the play from the sidelines...why can't I just make money honestly, like politicians, drug dealers and lottery winners?  I love to hate this game sometimes...|2021-07-13 11:18:40

526eft|ojcfk1|ojcfk1|2|cannabis stocks and why I won't invest in them:  To the consumer in most legal states: they have a choice of $200-300 with tax a zip or 60-100$ a zip from the traditional market. Being that most ppl are always seeking the best deal they'll take the traditional market. take away the threat of law enforcement and it will be even easier for the traditional market to operate.        ppl who haven't had both (legal/tradtional market weed) and are not regular smokers don't seem to understand that the freshness of weed matters. the fresher the better period. The testing/packing process legal entities have to go through means at best their weed is 4 weeks past its prime by the time it hits the shelf. Tack on that corporate weed is also being grown as cheap as possible and often isn't nearly the same flavor level as the organic soil grown stuff (but at scale growing in soil is $$).       So do what you want with that information, but there are much better stocks to invest in than cannabis. You might be able to time a pop, but I'll be shorting cannabis stocks since in the long term I know they'll struggle to ever turn a profit.|2021-07-13 12:42:15

Why do I say that?    Because it hit a bottom around $9 and is still in the $9 dollar range.   The short interest is still there.  The Volatility os definitely still there so it can have a dramatic jump with positive volume at any time.    So if your looking for a short or even a long play today is the day to dabble in CLOV.   You might mess around and accidentally make  it moon.|2021-07-13 08:11:44

520as7|ojcfk1|ojcfk1|-2|Delta covid isn't going to kill many young people or vaccinated people, but it's going to run rampant and people are not yet freaking out like they will be for a bit.  Even if we were all vaccinated, it would outbreak. And we aren't.  It can penetrate vaccines 1/3 of the time after someone's a few months out, and a ton of people rejected the vaccine. Putting it together, it has an r0 between 3 and 6 depending on where you are in the country. That's massive outbreak that will tempt the public health officials to do restrictions, and certainly cause people to do defensive behaviors. Put that in with 2x original covid infectiveness...  Original covid would have a baseline of 1. This is:  1/3 unvacinated \* 2 + 2/3 vaccinated or prior infected \*1/3 = 1. In other words, the same rate as before in december. But we aren't using public health measures any more, so itll be more contagious.  Positions: 35x 2150 august 06 RTY puts.  Edit: You guys are haters. I'm not personally freaking out. I'm concerned as to the market reaction to the consumer reaction. I think we will hit all time highs in fall, but we will get quite the IWM/RTY/RUT vol spike on the way there. The pattern we saw last week is the pre shock before the moderate vix spike that drops IWM maybe 10%, after which we can get back to btfding.|2021-07-13 11:57:22
