(Look at SPX/RUT ratio which is at 2.29, highest levels since May 2020).  Same thing happened in the tech bust with small caps far outperforming large caps over the following 12 years.  I think we're going to see the same thing play out over the next few years.  Where-ever the bottom is, the play is going to be to buy small caps.  Small caps are already back to pre-pandemic prices while S&P 500 is still stretched on valuations; the large caps are still priced to near perfection.|2022-05-12 08:18:16

8b4ybb|unxl5h|unxl5h|7|For those of you playing along at home and like to inverse me to make money.  I'm, very very stupidly,  playing a game called "The Dice have a memory".  I saw a pattern yesterday that I recognized, did some quick research (duh huh, I think it went up the next day!) bought some calls.  In my notes, I've already labeled that pattern "Buy Puts".  However, the last time I saw that pattern we mooned the next day.  That was the last "Bears r rekt" day.  I've also realized that when I'm guestimating High and Low for the day, I need to reduce my guestimate by 2 dollars in each direction.  Bullish things.  VIX isn't aiming for the floor but is 'technically' at "Buy".  A lot of panic selling is going on . . . but people want to take advantage of it so we are due a rally every now and then.  But I'd still expect a downtrend until we hit about 300 SPY.    The word of the day is GUH.  anyway, I'm at 400C SPY 1DTE, 33C TQQQ 1DTE  Guessing Low of the Day at 386 (384+2 for I never get this quite right).  High of the day at 402 (404-2 for I never get this right).  This presumes that A.  The dice have a memory, they don't.  and B. Someone says something nice and hopeful today.  They might not.  I'm probably fucked, but there's my brain, so maybe you won't be.|2022-05-12 07:20:19

8b4lv0|unxl5h|unxl5h|14|So much in common with the Japanese bubble of the 80s.  At one point, real estate in Japan was so expensive that the small amount of land around the palace in Tokyo was worth more than the entire state of California.  Companies on the Nikkei would go public with 200+ PEs.  At one point golf club memberships in Japan became tradeable entities to show off your wealth, and the market for memberships is estimated to have once been worth as much as $200B in 90s dollars.  The 80s bubble in Japan was driven by low interest rates and a central bank that pumped ginormous liquidity into the system.  It all unraveled when the Bank of Japan started to raise rates.  Some property in Japan lost over 90% of its value and to this day still hasn't recovered.  The Nikkei has never reached ATH again after 30+ years. We had a central bank in USA cutting rates to zero and pumping the shit out of liquidity.  Property values have exploded. EVs and SPACs go IPO with insane PEs. Just replace golf club memberships with NFTS and shit coins and its eerily a similar kind of bubble popping.|2022-05-12 07:17:18

Today I get puts on the little rebound just for it to fall a bit , me be up, not take profit, then the entire market rally.

8cru8d|unxl5h|unxl5h|8|If you're looking for bright spots today, IWM is trading much better than the overall markets.  Bonds have held up very strongly the past week and now that they've caught a bid, stocks can too.  Small caps are holding up very well today; in aggregate they're back to 2018 levels.  Most of the weakness right now is in the names that were strongest, stocks like AAPL and MSFT that held the S&P 500 up are now leading it (and the Nasdaq) down.  I think we'll see a long-term rotation to small caps (i.e. IWM) that will last for a few years at the end of this.  Stocks like AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, GOOG are already trading as if everything will go right for them over the next 3-5 years.  It's hard to justify P/E or P/S expansion on those names in a high rate environment with the Fed removing liquidity.  Small caps on the other hand are trading as if they're basically going out of business in the short term, which we know isn't going to happen.  And they'll benefit from inflation in terms of their high indebtedness being mitigated.|2022-05-12 14:04:57

8b5ah2|unxl5h|unxl5h|7|Here's an interesting stat for Tesla fans. I just priced a new Tesla and the cheapest one is $46,000 and this is without autopilot. A new Toyota Corolla starts at $20,000. Now everybody knows there is an advantage to an electric over a gas car with high gas prices which will only continue to go higher over the next 10 years so you want an electric car. Here's the funny part. It's cheaper to buy a new Toyota Corolla and have somebody remove the gas engine and gas tank and replace those with a DC electric motor and some batteries and you won't have the range but you're going to have an electric car for probably 23 24,000 with a very nice fit and finish interior and it's going to be a new car.|2022-05-12 07:23:18

8cvwb3|unxl5h|unxl5h|3|It’s 4:06AM in the morning. I step outside. I hear a weird animal cry. Kind of like a cat doing a screaming meow. Idk how to describe it. I don’t see where it came from but I know who it is. It’s the neighborhood coyote. He keeps making that noise every 5 seconds. I lock the door. I walk to my car and get in. I pull up to the stop sign and I see him illuminated across the street. I turn left towards his street and he starts running in the street. I speed up so he’s right on my bumper. I don’t want to hit him but I want him to be terrified. He does one zig zag then gets smart and turns right without his blinker. I stay true and go to work. I’ve seen many missing cat signs around my neighborhood and that coyote is probably the one doing it. Maybe I should’ve hit him, but I didn’t want to be late to work.|2022-05-12 14:30:52

8bnu65|unxl5h|unxl5h|0|The reality with DIS, that even wall-eyed, drooling red-neck morons have to admit, is that the company is built on its characters -- starting with the Mouse and maturing right up to Black Widow, Kermit, and Luke (Cage and Skywalker).  All those individual stories are what make Disney the real source of modern "Woke" power ... and create a huge machine for content streaming, TV, toys, parks, games, cruises.  Since 1920 Disney was built on the core idea that interesting characters are needed as employees and creators to generate the huge volume of wide-ranging characters that power the business.  These days, you don't succeed, around the globe and over decades, by taking the narrow vision of angry old fake Christian bigots.  Of course, the American Taliban of Trumpists gets pissed off by the power and success of Disney, and the ideas of diversity, inclusion, and growth which are at the core of all Disney characters and entertainment.  Disney would be doing it wrong if they made the haters happy.|2022-05-12 09:41:38

8b3311|unxl5h|unxl5h|-11|I have done a DD (Deep Dive) into our upcoming short squeeze. GME is not a ”video game retailer”, what they actually have been doing the last 6 years, since the sale of GTA 5 started to slow, is working on a user interface for SpaceX to enable private astronauts to land on the moon. Now Melvin Capital and Citadel is a clandestine operation by the CIA and NASA, and they don’t want it to be found out the moon landing was fake, hence they tried to bankrupt GME by shorting it to oblivion. When apes started DRS-ing shares they have extended the operation to include naked shorting even more!

8avceg|unxl5h|unxl5h|-10|Just had this wonderful exchange with one of you fucking inbred retards:  **Me:** Shorts have to cover eventually. I got my popcorn out for the fucking insane rally we're gonna have one of these days  **gfbkiuyted (retard):** you don't know what cover means lmao  **Me:** I think YOU don't. Do you know how short selling works?  **gfbkiuyted (retard):** I'm not going to explain it to you, but for yourown financial well-being you need to stop repeating ape talk and learn what these words really mean and the context around them. As a hint, whether stocks go up or stocks down affects the need to cover. Good luck  **Me:** You're so wrong it's funny. Short selling works like this:  I decide to short stock A.  It costs $10.  Broker lets me borrow the share to sell and charges me interest for being short 1 share of stock A. I DO NOT OWN THE STOCK.  Stock A does one of two things. It goes down or it goes up.  Regardless, I'm still short 1 share of stock A.  I have to buy the share back to close the trade and hopefully do it at a profit (if the stock I borrowed to sell goes up I'm fucked because I have to buy it back at a higher price).  This process of buying the share back is called covering. The stock market has dropped 20%. In order for short sellers to close the trade and lock in the profit, THEY HAVE TO COVER THEIR SHORT POSITION AND BUY THE SHARE BACK FROM THE BROKER. THIS WILL CAUSE A RALLY|2022-05-12 05:40:01
