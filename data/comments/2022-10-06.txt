The trade, which involved buying and selling call options tied to the index at a cost of around $31 million, probably helped fuel a recovery that saw the benchmark gauge erase a 1.8% decline, says Chris Harvey, the firm’s head of equity strategy.  The trade included buying 20,000 S&P 500 calls expiring in October with a strike price of 4,500 and 14,000 bullish contracts expiring in March at a strike of 4,300, while selling 48,000 calls maturing in January with an exercise price at 4,500 -- a bet that essentially says stocks would rally in coming months.|2022-10-06 08:50:30ra8fms|xx1esf|xx1esf|6|Tesla selling off.

Just be aware of short squeeze when it's consolidating after a breakout of MA resistance that's been keeping the market down. $275 zone is where it broke out of (retested yesterday and went to local highs in a +2.5% reversal move).

Well my first idea that we have the big red 2 is becoming more and more invalid, that would mean that we still form a new low - a new red 2! (Say lower prices than before.). I can post the days still my gold chart - ultimately, the Barrick chart pretty much hangs on just this gold chart, in addition, it is to say that in Elliott wave theory basically always the higher level "right" keeps, that works on the one hand on the time level, but also on the stock / indices level - in mining companies, it is accordingly the basic / mined commodity. (Other examples would be oil producers, iron mines or coffee producers - my current favorites).
