fmhxgj|q2h9uz|q2h9uz|5|I miss the dab bar in Nashville :(   want to talk to cute blonde budtender girl named Elizabeth until I‚Äôm too stoned to be sociable again  Edit: for the guy who asked about weed‚Äôs legality in Tennessee:  Weed is illegal there. They exist through loopholes. First off they have delta-8, and it‚Äôs high quality shit that actually gets you stoned. Beyond that though, many extracts, like live resin, are THCA, which is a precursor to delta-9 THC. Like, I pay *extra* to get dabs of this quality in NY.   THCA is inert until heated. You couldn‚Äôt just eat it and get high. As the farm bill legalizing hemp only regulates that you must have a low delta-9 THC %, THCA is legal.   Then they have edibles. Again, the law states the product must be under a specific delta-9 THC content % **by weight of product**. So basically they just have *larger* edibles to keep the % of Delta-9 THC by weight below .03%, but the edibles themselves have up to 40mg delta-9 THC in total.   My friends and I were pretty mindblown when we found the place, and more so when we realized it was legit and they had actual dabs, not just delta-8 and CBD.  Price was great too, a friend and I spent $30 on a beer for each of us + a round of dabs (6-7 hits on low temp, got absolutely smacked)|2021-10-06 12:02:01

fllrwf|q2h9uz|q2h9uz|4|I‚Äôd like to make a case for a pre-earning TLRY move to the upside. The stock has been beat to shit for months, but has finally found support at the $10.75-$10.90 level. Earnings are tomorrow and because they moved the date up, I am thinking there is some really good news. I think we‚Äôre going to continue to see the positive impact of the Aphria merger on the bottom line. I believe all of the bad news of the past has been completely over done and the shorts have bled this stock for several months. I‚Äôve been discouraged but I feel like we have this moment before earning to really turn things around and make the shorts cover. This could really be an explosive move to the upside if we all jump in now. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to get shit for this post because TLRY has disappointed for months. But every dog has its day. I think the time is now and this is the best place to put your money today. This is a short term play on earnings. I don‚Äôt think we go to the moon, but we can take it to the space station üõ∞ If we can break out over $13 (50 SMA) we will fly through to $17.50, around the 200 SMA.|2021-10-06 08:10:34

Don‚Äôt expect them to get extremely one-sided at least to the euphoric side since people are much more aware of sentiment levels that preceded prior corrections than they used to be.  Back when nobody understood the concept of a bubble and got blindly sucked in, if you were one of a small number of people paying attention you would‚Äôve had a huge advantage but it would‚Äôve been very hard to see it because nobody was talking about it. Now everyone talks about bubbles so it‚Äôs very hard for people to broadly get sucked in without having at least some awareness (even though there are plenty of bubbles going on within the broader market).  TLDR I dunno when the next correction will come or if we are in the early stages of it now but when it happens it will happen with pretty measured sentiment readings|2021-10-06 14:55:32

For our marketing department, I had to create a hypothetical company so was the birth of Stonk: "Where your money memes something" a hypothetical purely fictional stock trading platform that is very meme-centric. Now we have to create a marketing plan for our companies. One of the selling points of Stonk was going to be its direct integration with r/wallstreetbets. So I want to include Reddit in the marketing materials (all of which are completely non commercial and purely for use in this university project) do you all have any defining moments of the subreddit that you think could fit the bill?
