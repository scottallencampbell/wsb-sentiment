Never pay more than 50% of your salary on a house or rent.  If you are still in school, live with your parents while working for the first few years and save up as much as you can.  50% of your investments go into s&p500 and the rest is play money.  If you have an employer that does 401k, max that shit out or at least have 15% going in.  Never buy something with those pay later/lease etc apps or options. Never buy a "free phone" plan always buy the device up front and unlocked.  Plan your meals for the week so you dont overspend at the grocery store.  ![img](emotet5_2th528883)|2022-08-23 10:22:30

Still think market will be in a range until another weak CPI print or two come out. If CPI keeps coming in worse than expected then market will be fucked but until then peak inflation and range bound market until short yields top is the play imo.

lgqpbl|wvkpfw|wvkpfw|9|LMAO...they pumped the narrative that inflation has peaked based off of oil going down.  Oil decline is only a temporary reprieve due to release from the strategic petroleum reserves.  The SPR is now at its lowest levels since 1980. Release from the SPR is already scheduled to halt in October.  Natural gas is skyrocketing (wait until people see their food and heating bills soon) while housing costs haven't gone down at all.  Watch as inflation numbers creep back up again as oil and gas go parabolic in the fall and winter and housing costs continue to go up.  Shit is fucked, and they celebrated a Fed pivot far too early.  When NASDAQ crashed 70% from 2000-2001, there were 3 bull rallies along the way of over 30% each. It created a bunch of bagholders who lost their shirts.  Markets never go straight down; bull traps can be nasty.|2022-08-23 10:08:59

Made a few thousand pounds on top of my savings, and was generally getting better at trading  Then the bbby stuff happened and I was just kinda watching it for a few days thinking ‘ah that’s not going up further, lmao’ before realising it really was, which led to me completely giving into fomo. Literally managed to buy in like 10 separate times at the exact moment it reached a mini peak. Eventually ended up buying when it was above 25 and lost 5k, which was half of the amount I started with  So yeah, pain  I guess it’s a good thing though.

lgvgg2|wvkpfw|wvkpfw|2|Im reluctant to post non-ironically here, but yolo.....  TL;DR Where can I learn how to set up my trading business legitimately? What do I look for when searching for the right accountant?  After training, studying, and trading for over 5 years I'm planning to go full time forex trading. I'm an American expat living abroad (europe), and file in both countries.  My edge is trading liquidity on low timeframes for 1 or 2 trades a day. My risk management allows 10-20% gains and 5% max drawdown in any given month, and I'm pretty consistent now (hence the plan to make it my only job in January). It's not sexy, but absolutely sustainable, which is what I want.  Can you pros point me in the right direction in terms of where I can learn the business side of all this? Tax liability would be my chief concern as a currency scalper. I know there are things I need to avoid, but I don't even know what to look for in the right accountant. Plus do I incorporate or something else?   Is there a resource for this? It can't be something people muddle through right?   Thanks for any insight.|2022-08-23 10:39:32

lh1458|wvkpfw|wvkpfw|-2|It's easy for one of the least advanced humans to accept the idea that they're part of a species with developmental issues that might kill everyone, but for the most advanced humans life is a psychological struggle between that reality and the impulse to pretend you're above it.  When you're smart enough for it to be easy to tell yourself you're not one of the people causing our possible extinction, the other side of the coin is it being much harder to admit you are one.   Even if the human race has advanced far enough for the greatest people to be capable of saving us from climate change etc, a lot of suffering is caused by how the human race still isn't advanced enough for anyone to be capable of coping in a mentally healthy way with the flaws of the human race, especially at a time when this is an existential threat.|2022-08-23 11:15:53

lgyx55|wvkpfw|wvkpfw|-1|On Aug. 4, MindMed approved a 1-for-15 reverse share split of its common shares. As a result of the reverse share split, there will be approximately 28.4 million shares of common shares issued and outstanding.  The split will take effect after the closing bell on Aug. 26, and the stock will trade on a split adjusted basis on Aug. 29. In the press release, MindMed said the split is intended to 'give the company greater flexibility in considering and planning for future potential business needs, and to address the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement.'  The shares, which are worth 91 cents right now, will trade at $13.65 if the split were to take effect today. Considering the modest float, along with the fact that one-third of the float changed hands last week, the potential for a painful short squeeze is high.  If the r/wallstreetbets community shifts its attention from the Bed Bath & Beyonds and AMCs of the market, MindMed stock has the potential to see a squeeze akin to the recent Bed Bath & Beyond and AMC squeezes|2022-08-23 11:01:39
