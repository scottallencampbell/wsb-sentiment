hd215z|qbxd7v|qbxd7v|9|$TSLA calls with 1M or further expiries already got their IV crushed, yesterday was the year low, so very low chance of a post-ER IV crush being significant in that case.  However, $TSLA calls with 3 weeks or less still risk losing between 3 and 10 IV points.  If you want to hold through earnings, switch to longer maturities and go sufficiently ITM, because FDs will get destroyed. You can compute the expected impact of an IV crush vs the underlying move using online option pricers. Also to those holding stocks, selling covered calls isn't worth it, the IV is extremely low.  This isn't $NFLX which had a crazy IV run.  EDIT: slight correction, for the 1M+, it is Friday that was the year low in terms of call IV, but yesterday's IV was only 1 point higher.|2021-10-20 09:01:40

hecdyt|qbxd7v|qbxd7v|7|I think I really cucced myself with the RKLB 2024 vertical call spreads fatfinger I opened yesterday. I meant to buy RKLB 2024 LEAPS but didn't realize it was a spread until I opened the trade.   I've tied up, per leg, $663 in capital, whilst my gains are capped at roughly 33%. 33% over 3 years... and I can't even close out early because the liquidity on the short call portion of the vertical call spreads is so shit that even though nominally I should be gaining more money on the long call portion than losing money on the short call version, I'm not because the bid and ask is fucked. The max loss on the position is 50%.  I could close out now, but it'd be a 18% loss per leg 😐 I've basically locked 10% of my portfolio away for 3 years because of this shitty fatfinger|2021-10-20 14:15:13

hdyaqo|qbxd7v|qbxd7v|5|Commissions are what you pay your broker for their service.  Smartphone apps aren't actual human brokers, they're not providing you with a service. They don't even let you have open source software. What they charge isn't commissions, it's just protection money to stop them from scalping the bid/ask spread on you and make them go shake down whoever's on the other side of the trade instead of you. They just call it "commissions" because they're not allowed to call it what it is.   Personally, I'd rather deal with the honest bid/ask scalpers than the creepy scuzzbags lurking in the shadows like "hey kid, gimme 65 cents and I can probably get you the asking price maybe. think about the whole dollar you'll save. come on, right down this alley"|2021-10-20 12:40:59

hddus2|qbxd7v|qbxd7v|2|AXSM trending sideways the past several days up less  than half a buck today to $40.50 after last weeks power surge off the $32 level.  Investors still eagerly awaiting FDA approval for AXS 05, the crown jewel, multi billion dollar blockbuster drug the company began listing for account managers last week and then just yesterday increased their credit line in anticipation of marketing and rolling out the drug.  Analysts have targets as high as north of $150 making AXSM one of (one of) the best, most rare monster opportunities we will ever find.  Reminder, do not buy options in this one due to the extreme high premiums and the fact that there is just no need. Buying a $40 stock that is poised to go to $140 at any time makes it far better than an option because it doesn't expire and you can get it for $20 a share cash with margin. That's like having a stock that's an option, but again, better because it doesn't expire and you don't pay the premium.  One suggestion, buy double and sell calls on half so you get paid to wait. That's what I've done and have made thousands on a 40% add on to my core position.  Good luck|2021-10-20 10:26:00

hdx25o|qbxd7v|qbxd7v|4|Fed’s Quarles Says More Fiscal Stimulus Could Let Transitory Inflation Continue Too Long  A top Federal Reserve official said he expected elevated inflation pressures to decline without requiring a more aggressive response by the central bank next yearâ??but warned of growing risks to that forecast, including from additional government spending being contemplated by the Biden administration.its currently very elevated rateFed governor Randal Quarles said Wednesday he expected inflation to 'decline considerably next year from outstripped disrupted sits currently very elevated rate.' Inflation has been worse and longer-lasting than expected, Mr. Quarles said, because demand has temporarily upplyoutstripped disrupted supply.But because the 'fundamental productive capacity of our economy' hasn't changed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and because the factors disrupting the economy appear likely to fade over time, 'constraining demand now, to bring it into line with a transiently interrupted supply, would be premature,' he said.Fed officials need to balance the risk of overreacting to temporary disruptions, for example, by raising interest rates to cool off demand 'just as supply is increasing,' he said. That could lead inflation to fall too low and, in the worst case, feed an extended period of sluggish growth and unnecessarily low employment, Mr. Quarles said.|2021-10-20 12:32:47

If you've heard that I used to charge commissions, forget about it, that's a gibberish word with no meaning!"  And you're like "no the meaning is pretty simple, it's just charging money per trade"  And they're like "oh, I don't think I charge you any money for each trade! Who knows! Maybe I charge you money for every trade! This thing says I do! I'm pretty sure I don't!  Only one way to know for sure, sign up and try it!"

Both the companies have discussed a possible price of around $70 per    share, and the deal could value the digital pinboard site at about $39    billion, the report said.          After the news about a possible acquisition, Pinterest's stock was    halted twice on Wednesday.         PayPal's shares were down about 3.5%, while Pinterest's shares were up    over 10% at $61.55.         PayPal shares were down 5.6% at $256.50 midday Wednesday, while    Pinterest shares were rallying by 11.08% at $61.74. |2021-10-20 12:52:26

Wish has a lot of resources and competent leadership to turn the situation around.    Wish also has quite a strong balance sheet, and is virtually debt free with marketable securities, cash, and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 billion. In addition, compared to the cash balance, the cash burn rate is not alarming, unless the company keeps showing similar poor performance in the next few quarters.

hd6t8d|qbxd7v|qbxd7v|1|$XM earnings thesis  Qualtrics - experience management software. Experience management is becoming as critical as CRM or HR systems. And many of the world's largest and most respected companies are investing in XM such as Manchester United, Big Banks, major car companies & major retailers.  Since last quarters reporting, there have been two major pieces of news. The first being a partnership with Manchester United in the last 2 weeks, the financial details were not disclosed. I have a feeling they are saving this tidbit for this earnings report. Second, they finished an acquisition of Clarabridge for $1.1 billion in common shares at a share price of $37.33. They actually finished this acquisition a quarter earlier than anticipated.  Now that this acquisition is finished, the contributions of this acquisition will start showing up in their financials this quarter. Alongside increased partnerships it should provide another surprise earnings beat and I won't be surprised if they have a positive EPS for the 3rd quarter in a row. On top of that, I believe they will confirm that they will hit $1 billion in revenue this year, a big psychological number.  They're also on a hiring spree, trying to hire thousands of workers in Europe as their international traction gains from their prior parent company $SAP. You don't really hire thousands of workers unless your projecting consistently strong growth in the year ahead.  What really caught my eye yesterday was the fact that someone bought 4,500 contracts on both $45 & $50 11/19 call contracts yesterday before earnings. Once I saw that, I took a look at their technical setup and if you peak at the daily charts, you'll see a nice cup & handle pattern forming.  TL;DR  * 4,500 contracts opened on both $45 / $50 11/19 calls  * i believe this will be the 3rd quarter of positive EPS and likely $1 billion in revenue will be achieved  * Manchester United partnership & Clarabridge acquisition completion is big|2021-10-20 09:37:21

he2lyu|qbxd7v|qbxd7v|-3|Here's my 2 cents on BB. BB has a lot of bag holders who bought in around the 14-15 mark and then some with bags between 16-20. Given that it's a sound company with good future potential, most bag holders patiently have held on to their shares instead of booking a loss and thus with more good news coming in it got over a 15% jump in prices even with not that high a trading volume (as compared to the meme wave time). If the current investors don't bail out, it could really reach the price point of $15 by the end of this week, unless a meme wave pushes it to over 20 mark again. However important thing to consider is the bullish run in digital coin market and with the alt season around the corner, I doubt we'll see a meme wave yet for theirs quick profit to be made in the coins. An around the corner alt season also means that a lot of whales who were earlier shorting BB will try to get quick gains from the that market instead meaning BB will be spared for a few weeks and is definitely a good short term investment for the month!|2021-10-20 13:09:49
