You pay $20/month for an Onn brand EV car that drives back to the Walmart+ EV charger at night. All televisions and tablets are Onn brand.

They generally make the most on flat prices and they have ways to reduce their sensitivity to price changes, basically by buying and selling shares.  When GEX is high, MM must buy/sell(short) shares against the prevailing direction to reduce their their exposure. If markets fly upward while MM has high gamma exposure then MM must sell/short to reduce gamma exposure. That's what I think explains the big drops this morning.|2020-07-09 12:12:08

xfyozy|ho0krw|ho0krw|8|Hang in there man. Each trade is a learning experience. This sounds cliche as fuck but allow yourself to learn from the mistake. Ask yourself why you are trading? Be honest with yourself, and enter positions when they seem appealing to you, not when you appeal themselves to it.  For the last month, I had paper hands so many trades that I initially entered with conviction. I cut my losses only to see I was right in most circumstances. The fear of losing and being wrong actually caused me to lose more. Now, when I see a red day, especially in tech, I see it as an opportunity. It’s more risk, but it’s risky to trade in any environment. I would rather just try to switch up my strategy.   Good luck man|2020-07-09 12:36:43

xf9dow|ho0krw|ho0krw|15|The year is 2058. For 38 years, SPY has vacillated between 300 and 320. As you stare off into the distance, you feel a tug at your sleeve. It's your grandson. "Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy. A quiet rage flares behind your eyes, then fades to sadness.            ^^^Yes, ^^^I ^^^posted ^^^this ^^^before, ^^^but ^^^I’ll ^^^post ^^^it ^^^in ^^^every ^^^thread ^^^until ^^^it’s ^^^untrue.|2020-07-09 09:09:40

Continuing claims remained above 18M despite states reopening especially for 4th July holiday  Now you have record high rates, Florida has 18.4% positive test rates and the US now accounts for a quarter of the world's cases.  Then you have Fauci cryptically saying that states with problems controlling the virus ought to shutdown without explicitly naming them. But we all know it's Texas, Florida, Arizona & etc which just so happens to be the largest few contributors to US GDP.   If tech fails to lift off in earnings, we are going to see a bloodbath.

xfw5zd|ho0krw|ho0krw|6|3 weeks ago I made two grand off a Disney call, but when I sold I was listed as a PTD. So I was forced to actually take profits for once and I can't trade until September 15th. It's weird when I withdrew the money and saw it in my account I suddenly started to enjoy myself and hangout with people without constantly checking my phone being nervous about the market, plus it's nice to have some cash to throw around. Moral of the story: Do not forget to take profits and breaks. Enjoy your life and don't ever let this become your life. God Bless boys and see ya on 9/15.|2020-07-09 12:17:15

xg4mkw|ho0krw|ho0krw|13|   I've been reading these "Corona is cancelled" and "no one cares about the virus anymore" posts for weeks. Listen retards, I know "priced in" is a meme, but this is a PSA for anyone who actually believes that anything is priced in - it rarely is. The market was fucking MOONING all through the first 2 MONTHS of grim pandemic news at the beginning of the year. It wasn't until the last possible second that the market reacted to it and the crash was monstrous.  2021 isn't priced in. Future profits aren't priced in. Second wave isn't priced in. Trump winning or losing the election isn't priced in. ZM is at P/E 2500+ and Hertz flew up hundreds of percent after catastrophic bankruptcy news. If you trade based on "priced in," prepare to get fucked. If you think the market won't eventually care about catastrophic Covid numbers, you're going to get fucked. If you trade like the market has to care about those numbers right now, you're going to get fucked. If you want to make money, just think like you're a short-sighted retard and don't be the last guy holding the bag|2020-07-09 13:21:54

xfs2s4|ho0krw|ho0krw|15|So let me get this:  * the US shut down their economy  to save people from the coronavirus (just like Europe). * they set up a set of rules and phases to guide the reopening and avoid a second wave (just like Europe) * They proceeded to consider the virus a fake and gay hoax and just reopened anyway without following their own criteria (not like Europe)  and now it comes as a surprise to markets that the hospitals might get overloaded unless another shutdown occurs, they can't be this braindead right ??  Surely this can't be the reason we are down today ?|2020-07-09 11:44:48

The Justice Department should not launch federal prosecutions of conduct that is legal at the state level. All past criminal convictions for cannabis use should be automatically expunged.

xey859|ho0krw|ho0krw|4|Ok WMT gang, until a formal announcement & press we may be bleeding, but support looks like it’s hanging at 125. The Motley Fool article specifying an official launch “per insider sources, in the next two weeks” I can no longer find, and appears to have been removed. All other press is a variation of the initial Recode “leak” article, aside Tom’s which had verification from WMT but no sources on actual launch week .... so, 7/10 calls risky, August and longer calls should still good (as I don’t think it would have such a leak if it weren’t actually going to launch July - but it could be dead silent until the last week - who knows), all depends on your entry point and if you want to take a loss vs seeing it play out.

Next key level looks to be about ~$18.70ish; if we don't break this today; ~~which I doubt we will~~, which we fucking did, $SPCE will probably ~~trade between ~$17 and ~$18.25 for the rest of the week~~.   If somehow $SPCE breaks above ~$18.70, next stop is $20 and the fucking moon!  EDIT: Didn't age well for the good; looks like resistance is more towards ~$19.10. Fucking hold it $SPCE!

xgaabo|ho0krw|ho0krw|4|My theory is that we won’t reach a new ATH for a long ass time.   Tech is going to at some point flatten out along with the other sectors. Then once it starts looking brighter there is going to be a huge rotation out of Tech while cyclical stocks rally which will actually drag SPY down because of the weighting. Then once things are actually back to normal we will chug back to all time highs while tech grows back to current levels  I don’t think anything can crash the market the way we did. If tech falls big for some reason we will just return to the 280 level by the end of it.|2020-07-09 14:05:56

xey5te|ho0krw|ho0krw|3|Question for people more autistic than myself:   &#x200B;  Lets say I am setting up an iron butterfly/condor on a volatile stock and my premium received is greater than the collateral needed to cover the edges of the spread. So if the spread width on each side is $10 that would be $1000 collateral needed to open the trade, but what if I get $1050 in premium.   &#x200B;  My question here is, what are the risks? I am aware of pin risk, but if both legs on one side expire deep ITM, you would either sell before expiration or you exercise your long leg at expiration alongside the short exercised leg and end up losing the $1000 difference, overall profiting $50. If I am exercised before expiration with both legs ITM, I can just exercise the long leg and same scenario, I only lose the $1000 difference.  &#x200B;  What risks am I missing?|2020-07-09 07:11:31

xfcqx9|ho0krw|ho0krw|8|#Get in here if you like money  Alright guys FedEx (FDX) smashed earnings and jumped 20% to $163 before later falling to around $157 (where it’s at right now).  UPS has earnings on the 30th. It got a decent boost from FDX earnings of about 8% which put it at $119. It has now fallen to 114 since then. Meaning it only received a boost of about ~4% from FDX earnings.  Assuming UPS has similar earnings to FDX, this would imply a remaining 16% upside in the stock price. But even if they don’t pop as hard as FDX did, they should jump at least 8%.  It’s still a decent ways off from its ATH of $135 back in January 2018. And before COVID crash it was trading at $125. Tremendous upside.  TL;DR: Buy UPS calls if you like money UPS 7/31 130c for .60 UPS 8/21 135c for .54|2020-07-09 09:39:13

It makes life way more interesting then flatlining through life working consistently to pay rent or some shit. The only people that care are the super serious family oriented career goal boomers Karen's and Darren's. It's like the volitility of life and lots get off on this. Selfish and narcissistic, yes.

xg5du8|ho0krw|ho0krw|3|This is what is going to happen.   Boomers die from corona. Boomers are the MMs. Boomers control the government. Boomers are the voters. Certain cities will lock down again because old people die. The old people running this shit want to get reelected and not die. Pretty simple concept here. Since they also are the MMs, they will exit the market in droves because they need to protect their lifelong gains which need to last them until they die naturally or of corona. They will move their dollars into real estate because its real to them, interest rates are low, and they see all younger generations as keyboard pressers than can work from home. Rents will rise. Single family real estate will rise. Meanwhile the retail traders aka everyone but them will get totally fucked. 401ks gone. Your buy the dip calls that always worked since april, gone. And after all of this they will still tell us how if they could pay for their easy mode phd by working part time and how they rode the wave of the most prosperous time in world history, then so can we. Once again, we will be fucked. This divide will continue to present itself as a racial and wealth battle. Riots will happen again but on a larger scale. SPY 265|2020-07-09 13:27:43

Example: I made 10k but I lose 5k but then I made another 10k so I have a total of 15k. Would I have to pay the percentage of the 15k or 20k total (both 10k gains) I have made?

xfnwmj|ho0krw|ho0krw|2|So, let's talk stimulus. July 17th congress returns from recess. They must find a compromise between Dems who want $600 unemployment boost all year long, and Repubs who just want a back to work boost. While they continue to argue about that, the boost will end July 31st. Meanwhile like a third of homeowners didn't make a house payment for July.  We also have McConnell making comments suggesting that any direct checks would be limited to the poorest citizens - individuals making $40k or less per year. There also seems to be a hesitation to provide much in the way of assistance to state and local governments. Basically, I predict there will be a stimulus but we won't see it for months, and it will be weak sauce, not strong enough to help states that will likely be shut down again by then.|2020-07-09 11:11:34

Quick $1200 usd profit. Contracts are currently 0.40 now since $MOMO drop since open today.  Started with $2000usd two days ago from a line of credit. Bought $TWTR during morning yesterday before the moon. Sold at 150% profit but could of been 300% profit if I sold at a higher peak. If I went further otm for strike for 1400% gain.  Feeling good and retarded! Now sitting at $6200usd. Enough to pay off 90% of debt.  I'm a gambling addict at heart so I want to buy $EBAY 2021 leaps to sell during the ER run up. Logically, i should withdraw all my money completely.  I need your help, guidance and thoughts. Do I pull out like i did last night?

xfzpjn|ho0krw|ho0krw|-1|Thought of the day, from 1999/2000  *At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?* **Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are?** *You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes.* **What were you thinking?**  Pick your fav ticker now, what is their EV/R?  TSLA - 10.1  AMZN - 5.3 !  ZM - 90.5  !!!  NIO - 16.1  and so on.....look out  Above was Sun Microsystems, dot com darling. Was trading at $10, went up to $64, then back to $10  More on ZH if interested|2020-07-09 12:44:26

xgfeym|ho0krw|ho0krw|0|political but has to do with the market-  &#x200B;  Here is the problem with completely polarized politics. On one hand the pendulum swung to the right side- Whether you like trump or not he has dropped the ball on a lot of things and the left is all riled up.  Right now the left has a ton of momentum- look at whats happening. So we have a relatively moderate candidate like joe- he is caving to the far left whack jobs because they are the loudest out there.   So now the pendulum starts to shift.  Joe was a pretty run of the mill politician that wasn't going to scare the corporations a few months ago- that is until the momentum of the left increased. Look at every corporation giving in and kowtowing to every demand. The biden campaign thinks it needs to jump on board and now its making comments like defunding the police and increasing capital gains tax & corporate taxes--- this is how the pendulum works.  swing to the right, swing further left, then back further right...  From a traders standpoint- put aside who you want in office- just be prepared for how it will affect the market. put your bias aside.|2020-07-09 14:46:37
