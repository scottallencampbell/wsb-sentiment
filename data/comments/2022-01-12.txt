The problem is their understanding of herd behavior is so flawed.  Hedgies aren't some mystical cabal that controls the world, they're just as retarded as everyone else.  In some ways more so because their incentives are completely ass backwards in terms of delivering long-term value to investors.    No surprise that the system will naturally select first the ability to raise money and sell the fund.  After that it's going to select those who favor making fuckloads of money by staying invested *in something* at all times.|2022-01-12 07:52:55

scz2hi|s23o5c|s23o5c|4|Why Some Inflation is Good:        So, inflation is good for borrowers, neutral for investors, and it‚Äôs only bad for people who are either holding cash, or stuck with an income source that does not keep up with inflation.         But it‚Äôs also good for the economy in general. Why? Because if people expect that prices will rise slightly over time, it encourages them to spend and invest right now. If prices are stable or dropping, we have an incentive to wait as long as possible to make a purchase, to get the lowest possible price. This isn‚Äôt just hypothetical ‚Äì deflation has been happening in Japan for over 20 years, and has been a core part of that country‚Äôs chronic economic problems.        Because of this, the central bankers that pull the strings behind our economy (Federal Reserve bank and the Treasury) generally work together to engineer a controlled rate of economic expansion and inflation over time. If things get too hot, they slow it down by raising interest rates. If we have a harsh recession, they do the opposite and drop interest rates as well as ‚Äúprinting money‚Äù to purchase bonds, loans, sometimes even stocks in order to prop up prices and re-start the economic engine. This practice is controversial at times, but as you can see from stock and house prices, company profits and ‚ÄúNow Hiring‚Äù signs everywhere, it does work.|2022-01-12 09:47:18

But also inflation is fucked if they don't.  üåàüêªs think rates continue in a straight line and crash imminent.  OP sides with hikes -> but Fed backtracking to save the economy.  I am more in the middle.  Fed will A) attempt to slow hikes to prevent this difficult decision altogether B) ultimately pivot but AGAIN pivot as inflation comes back stronger and finally raise rates like crazy.  Inflation will not be tamed for a long time and fuck average people outside of the market, delaying the crash yet again, but Fed has to stabilize prices eventually.

The takeaway is that Europeans are retarded and the only ones still balls deep in a dying video game store for some reason.

sd6p4p|s23o5c|s23o5c|3|I grew up in Italy, when inflation was around 20% to 25% a year.  The economy boomed during all the Seventies, growing 3+% more than inflation. People adapted rapidly. Sellers could transfer price increases on their customers and even try to "ride it" if they could. There was an automatic wage increase system (called the "escalator") which, by all his shortcomings (the biggest: feeding inflation) avoided shocks in the buying power of the population.  Those who were screwed were the old people keeping their money under the mattress or in a saving account at 6%. Of course, inflation also caused massive redistribution fights, but this is a different conversation.  As a whole, the economy was growing, people were coping, investors were fattening themselves.  Inflation fears are vastly overrated, certainly so for stock investors.|2022-01-12 10:36:06

scwadi|s23o5c|s23o5c|1|That locked thread of congressman stock performance that also made it on some news sites (to bash WSB indirectly) was interesting because it's was always a useless statistic. Nor was it WSB exclusive.  These congressman can delay their disclosures months after the trade happens or more during the year (or more) so you can't actually follow anyone outside leaked out or major trades which is like 2% of the time.  Most of the time those trades they have made are changed or sold, or brought by the time you realize what their old positions were, IF you do find out, since many stock trades aren't ever disclosed, despite there being timing rules supposedly on the books, yet almost every trade by a congressman is around 2-10 months late for their positions to be recorded, IF they are.  So when people were going goo goo over that Alan guy having the best trades compared to the SPY among all the congressman, that's completely useless because there's nothing to currently follow. You could try and imitate his current known positions only to realize those positions were two months outdated 5 months from now when you learn of his real current positions at this time.  If it was so easy to even partially track these congressmans trades with short gaps in between their trade disclosures, at least half the smart people would be doing it. It's nonsense. Not to mention all these congressman are insider trading too.   Bottom line, no, you can't get rich just following outdated congressional positions unless you have the same or better inside trading info they do, sorry.|2022-01-12 09:29:00
