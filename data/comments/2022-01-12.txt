The problem is their understanding of herd behavior is so flawed.  Hedgies aren't some mystical cabal that controls the world, they're just as retarded as everyone else.  In some ways more so because their incentives are completely ass backwards in terms of delivering long-term value to investors.    No surprise that the system will naturally select first the ability to raise money and sell the fund.  After that it's going to select those who favor making fuckloads of money by staying invested *in something* at all times.|2022-01-12 07:52:55

The apartment is beautiful, stainless appliances, granite countertops, etc. Days later, the trash chute is fully backed up with refuse. Turns out no one works for the garbage company anymore, it’s just not a job worth doing. The building begins to stink strongly of hot trash. At CVS, there’s no Febreeze bottles to return with and suppress the stench. The Febreeze workers are striking and nothing has been produced and shipped in weeks. A leftover bottle may still be in stock at the Walgreens one town over. On the way to Walgreens, the mod’s car gets a flat tire. The emergency service won’t respond. The mod calls Bezos and tells him to bring a tire, stat. Bezos said he doesn’t work anymore either, and the rent’s gonna be due in a week.|2022-01-12 12:43:11

sdp3y9|s23o5c|s23o5c|4|S&P: 2,910 US companies either initiated or raised the common dividends in 2021, a 53% increase from a year earlier. The number of positive actions that occurred was the most in a calendar year since 2014, when 3,308 were taken. Meanwhile, just 170 companies took a negative dividend action in 2021, by either cutting or suspending their dividend. This total was not only 82% lower than it was in 2020 – it was lower than in any of the past 8 years.  The fact that this many companies decided to increase their dividend payouts is a sign of near-term confidence.|2022-01-12 12:30:04

scz2hi|s23o5c|s23o5c|4|Why Some Inflation is Good:        So, inflation is good for borrowers, neutral for investors, and it’s only bad for people who are either holding cash, or stuck with an income source that does not keep up with inflation.         But it’s also good for the economy in general. Why? Because if people expect that prices will rise slightly over time, it encourages them to spend and invest right now. If prices are stable or dropping, we have an incentive to wait as long as possible to make a purchase, to get the lowest possible price. This isn’t just hypothetical – deflation has been happening in Japan for over 20 years, and has been a core part of that country’s chronic economic problems.        Because of this, the central bankers that pull the strings behind our economy (Federal Reserve bank and the Treasury) generally work together to engineer a controlled rate of economic expansion and inflation over time. If things get too hot, they slow it down by raising interest rates. If we have a harsh recession, they do the opposite and drop interest rates as well as “printing money” to purchase bonds, loans, sometimes even stocks in order to prop up prices and re-start the economic engine. This practice is controversial at times, but as you can see from stock and house prices, company profits and “Now Hiring” signs everywhere, it does work.|2022-01-12 09:47:18

But also inflation is fucked if they don't.  🌈🐻s think rates continue in a straight line and crash imminent.  OP sides with hikes -> but Fed backtracking to save the economy.  I am more in the middle.  Fed will A) attempt to slow hikes to prevent this difficult decision altogether B) ultimately pivot but AGAIN pivot as inflation comes back stronger and finally raise rates like crazy.  Inflation will not be tamed for a long time and fuck average people outside of the market, delaying the crash yet again, but Fed has to stabilize prices eventually.  The economy will cease to function properly when prices don't stop changing constantly and eventually spiral.|2022-01-12 07:09:19

sd6p4p|s23o5c|s23o5c|3|I grew up in Italy, when inflation was around 20% to 25% a year.  The economy boomed during all the Seventies, growing 3+% more than inflation. People adapted rapidly. Sellers could transfer price increases on their customers and even try to "ride it" if they could. There was an automatic wage increase system (called the "escalator") which, by all his shortcomings (the biggest: feeding inflation) avoided shocks in the buying power of the population.  Those who were screwed were the old people keeping their money under the mattress or in a saving account at 6%. Of course, inflation also caused massive redistribution fights, but this is a different conversation.  As a whole, the economy was growing, people were coping, investors were fattening themselves.  Inflation fears are vastly overrated, certainly so for stock investors.|2022-01-12 10:36:06

scwadi|s23o5c|s23o5c|1|That locked thread of congressman stock performance that also made it on some news sites (to bash WSB indirectly) was interesting because it's was always a useless statistic. Nor was it WSB exclusive.  These congressman can delay their disclosures months after the trade happens or more during the year (or more) so you can't actually follow anyone outside leaked out or major trades which is like 2% of the time.  Most of the time those trades they have made are changed or sold, or brought by the time you realize what their old positions were, IF you do find out, since many stock trades aren't ever disclosed, despite there being timing rules supposedly on the books, yet almost every trade by a congressman is around 2-10 months late for their positions to be recorded, IF they are.  So when people were going goo goo over that Alan guy having the best trades compared to the SPY among all the congressman, that's completely useless because there's nothing to currently follow. You could try and imitate his current known positions only to realize those positions were two months outdated 5 months from now when you learn of his real current positions at this time.  If it was so easy to even partially track these congressmans trades with short gaps in between their trade disclosures, at least half the smart people would be doing it. It's nonsense. Not to mention all these congressman are insider trading too.   Bottom line, no, you can't get rich just following outdated congressional positions unless you have the same or better inside trading info they do, sorry.|2022-01-12 09:29:00

Freeing up shares. If you have Jan $37.50, please sell them to me. I'm bidding a buck for two contracts. Also, Jan $40, will put in bids for them also.     Thanks|2022-01-12 13:44:30
