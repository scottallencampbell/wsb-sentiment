Trump calling for treason, reaching with ridiculous tweets, and the whistleblower set to testify in private at some point this week is leading me to think there will be equity selling again this week, starting with tomorrow. Oh yea, the FED injected another 60b in the MM...it's more attractive for people to get into the MM now and be more defensive. We saw huge movement from equities to MM last week, and I expect that trend to continue while there is so much trade uncertainty and continued pushing by the fed (the fed is literally trying to cause a recession you guys).

I have gotten 3 SF boxes and two were a complete disaster and the exact opposite of what I asked for. Extremely autistic stylists. Amazon personal shopper shows you a bunch of items and you can select up to 8 of them to try on. SF selects 5 and sends them to you without prior approval.  SF has no future if it doesn’t significantly improve its service.|2019-09-30 11:07:57
