Both of these tests were insanely accurate for whatever reason (i.e. fucking algos).  Momentum indicators show that we may consolidate here or even pull back a bit more, so I would actually hold off on immediately going long here just because we're testing previous ranges-- wait until at least EOD before making a decision.|2019-12-02 11:31:32

But they‚Äôre extending all their sales until those sales items are gone, so they will sell anyway.

They‚Äôll show a lot of membership revenue. And they‚Äôll bounce back from this one day snafu. They‚Äôll have a strong cyber Monday.

Utterly shambolic economies with no national unity or mandate to do anything, let alone stand in the way of US interests. They are local friends and allies. National security is a nifty baseball bat that the right wing has decided to use to sweep clean the entirety of the government. Yes they are sweeping floors with baseball bats in this metaphor.

9g58ql|e4xkju|e4xkju|0|So I went to TGT with the girlfriend last night. For those who are unaware TGT has taken upper single digits of Ulta‚Äôs market share. Consumer spending on luxury cosmetics has dropped but spending has increased on luxury skincare. Which makes sense, you need less makeup when your skin is great. Now TGT has gotten some skincare brands that were exclusive to Sephora who has a better line than Ulta. Ulta‚Äôs skincare sales are minor in comparison to their makeup. TGT has Ulta by the ovaries. TGT is now a luxury (feeling) one stop shop for everything $Becky. Puts on Ulta for ER. They will likely blame China or whatever for lowered guidance but it‚Äôs target fucking them.  I expect TGT to acquire more luxury cosmetic brands in the near future.|2019-12-02 07:32:25
