9fsrki|e4xkju|e4xkju|59|Moments before the opening bell, u/Aidangamer28 anxiously grips his sippy-cup of coffee.  “Free Tendies”, he erotically whispers to himself.  He doesn’t know what to attribute his upcoming success to.  Perhaps it’s all those hours he spent researching stocks and options.  Perhaps it’s those vaccinations his parents administered to him as a child.  Regardless of the origins, he’s certain that he’s identified the glitch, and knows what he must do.  Like Neo from the Matrix, u/Aidangamer28 is about to take down the system.  His logic is solid, his penis is flaccid.  “1 minute to open”, he wheezes through clenched teeth.  His heart beating heavily in his chest reminds him that it’s good to be alive.  His hydrocephalic head pounds with the blood and adrenaline pumping through his body.  His penis remains flaccid.  At the same moment, Peter sits in his cubicle at the RobinHood corporate office in Menlo Park, California.  Like Agent Smith from the Matrix, Peter is tasked with ensuring that the glitch remains unmolested.  His palms are sweaty, his penis is also flaccid.  The risk-management team was very clear with their instructions, written in crayon and feces, “THIS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED.”  The stage is set.  The clanging of the bell signals the opening of the market.  This is bigger than Bulls vs Bears.  This is bigger than all of them.  This is peak autism. |2019-12-02 05:07:12

9h1oxs|e4xkju|e4xkju|5|I'll give a quick **Magical Crayons TA.**  The drop today is not extreme-- we filled a recent gap on [SPY](https://imgur.com/cyW4KLA) and on [NQ](https://imgur.com/beaTTRW) we've tested off a resistance I had drawn on Nov 20. Both of these tests were insanely accurate for whatever reason (i.e. fucking algos).  Momentum indicators show that we may consolidate here or even pull back a bit more, so I would actually hold off on immediately going long here just because we're testing previous ranges-- wait until at least EOD before making a decision.|2019-12-02 11:31:32

She's in a sorority, and for anyone that watches insta pages like top tier or old row, sorority chicks are the craziest. So a little scared. One day she could be sucking on my balls, the next she'll have glued them to my leg over some petty bullshit. We'll see.   tl;dr I have upgraded match from a sell to a hold|2019-12-02 06:57:06

9fwxlo|e4xkju|e4xkju|5|Obviously he has to look tough and took this futures pump as an opportunity to do so.   Given the recent cycle, once the markets digest and decide stocks only go up again, the rally will continue until the Chinese media runs tradetalksgoingpoorly.exe, at which point the market will drop and Trump will say we are now micrometers away from a deal.   I'm guessing no deal but a delay in the tariffs being enacted on the 15th as a spark for a Christmas rally and a foundation for Trump to talk hella shit on China heading into the New Year.

9ge2pb|e4xkju|e4xkju|2|Just bought the dip on Costco calls. They dipped because a story said their site was down on thanksgiving and will cost them $11 million. But they’re extending all their sales until those sales items are gone, so they will sell anyway. Earnings are 12/12 and they will likely crush it because their new Costco store in China, their first, was wildly popular. Three hour long waits to get inside. They’ll show a lot of membership revenue. And they’ll bounce back from this one day snafu. They’ll have a strong cyber Monday. Bought 12/13 calls at the money and waiting for the ER.|2019-12-02 08:43:52

How would owning any of these defunct companies benefit my offspring today? Indexing is a meme. Most of the companies today won’t exist in 80 years.  Also you could argue that you drop the stocks when they are dropped from the index. Yea. Well when they are dropped from the index their valuation will get crushed and that won’t be counted in the index thereby making the index outperform in a way that can’t be attained.|2019-12-02 13:11:22

9g58ql|e4xkju|e4xkju|0|So I went to TGT with the girlfriend last night. For those who are unaware TGT has taken upper single digits of Ulta’s market share. Consumer spending on luxury cosmetics has dropped but spending has increased on luxury skincare. Which makes sense, you need less makeup when your skin is great. Now TGT has gotten some skincare brands that were exclusive to Sephora who has a better line than Ulta. Ulta’s skincare sales are minor in comparison to their makeup. TGT has Ulta by the ovaries. TGT is now a luxury (feeling) one stop shop for everything $Becky. Puts on Ulta for ER. They will likely blame China or whatever for lowered guidance but it’s target fucking them.  I expect TGT to acquire more luxury cosmetic brands in the near future.|2019-12-02 07:32:25
