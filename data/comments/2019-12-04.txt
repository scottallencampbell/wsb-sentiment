Basically Trump admitted that his comments didn't reflect the situation with the talks, he just wanted to be a "tough guy". Bears who'll get fucked today are asking for it, godspeed.  Here's the current situation, from BBG story:  >U.S. negotiators expect a phase-one deal with China to be completed before American tariffs are set to rise on Dec. 15, the people said. Outstanding issues in the talks include how to guarantee China‚Äôs purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and exactly which tariffs to roll back, they added.  And yeah before you say anything, of course it's all bollocks, but market ain't about what's real and what's not, it's about what has changed versus day before.

9n67lw|e5xn7f|e5xn7f|4| From Fidelity TA ‚Äútop triangle‚Äù. The price seems to have reached a top, showing signs of reversal as it has broken downward after a period of uncertainty or consolidation.   A Top Triangle shows two converging trendlines as prices reach lower highs and higher (or stable) lows. Volume diminishes as the price swings back and forth between an increasingly narrow range reflecting uncertainty in the market direction. Then well before the triangle reaches its apex, the price breaks down below the lower trendline with a noticeable increase in volume, confirming this bearish pattern as a reversal of the prior uptrend.

9muhl2|e5xn7f|e5xn7f|1|My thoughts today:  1. Image thinking natural gas prices ever go up.   2. You can still make over $200 per contract by selling lulu puts that expire this Friday that have a strike price already below the current stock price.   3. AUPH is just absolutely insane. I bought the stock at $6 and then sold covered calls at $9. The premium was so high I got $2 per call. So $9 might seem not that high and like leaving money on the table, but that‚Äôs $9 on a stock effectively bought for $4 in just one month. The insane thing is it seems possible we could be at that strike before the phase 3 trial results are even announced. I definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting that.|2019-12-04 08:42:37

Markets will not get a definitive answer until next week, maybe even the 14th, and will rise on any sign of optimism on the deal.

The consolation is that all your lost money these past couple months will pay off (if you haven‚Äôt gone bankrupt) thanks to the powerful tool known as leverage.
