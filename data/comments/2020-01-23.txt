The ship was thought to be unsinkable, so even when it struck an iceberg and began to take on water, passengers were not overly alarmed at first. Much like how wsb bulls believe stonks only go up.  2. The new coronavirus is reported to have started in a Chinese market where they eat, among other things, cobras, rats, and bats. Cobras, rats, chefs, and bats feature as enemies in the Titanic video game, released in the 90s. The 90s were a time of unsustainable tech bubbles.  3. In conclusion, a market crash is coming and it has something to do with Titanic, and cobras, rats, chefs, and bats. Ti...ti...tit.. Titenic https://youtu.be/G9DKoMSiDc4|2020-01-23 11:32:11

fbsr39|esrlmx|esrlmx|4|How many of you tards actually play calendar spreads? If you do two legs, they print money.  **EDIT:** Ok, so this is how it works. You find a stock with ridiculous option premium, like, say, NFLX. You're pretty sure NFLX won't move outside of a +/- $10 window from it's current price *in one week's time*. So you open the trade like this. Say the price is $100. You sell one $110 call exp on the next Friday, one $90 put with the same exp and then you **buy** the same strikes for the same type of options that exp the following Friday.  This is a net debit to enter this trade. You exit the trade no later than Thursday or Friday for the current week. This is especially profitable for ER's. You're profiting off of theta and IV in the case of earnings.  If you place your strikes right, it won't even matter if the strikes you sold go ITM. Key thing to ensure is that you look at optionsprofitcalc and adjust your strike windows accordingly. This obviously won't work with every ticker, but I only had $500 to play with this week and I will close today or tomorrow with a $1000 profit.|2020-01-23 06:09:23

fctb9h|esrlmx|esrlmx|1|I have a 290/300c debit spread on Apple (bought when Apple was around 280) that is well within the money. It expires March 20th. So long as Apple stays above 300 by March 20th, I'll reach pretty close to Max profit. Bought for 3.30, now at 7.75.   I'm assuming the liquidity of these options will drop if Apples strike price gets really far away from these. Because of this, I'm tempted to sell now and buy another spread that's slightly out of the money again. But, selling now would leave some money on the table on my 290/300c spread.   What do you guys recommend doing? Sell my deep in the money spread and open a new out-of-the-money spread? Or keep holding?|2020-01-23 13:13:49
