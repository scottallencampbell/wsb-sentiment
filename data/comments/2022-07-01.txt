It continues to buy the dip, becoming increasingly enraged as the market rejects every one of it's advances.   Sadly, many bulls are liquidated by the time the low inflation seasons return.

eguhaq|vox64k|vox64k|7|All that talk about recession in 2023 and everything ended up getting moved up to first half 2022.  Recession likely to be dated starting March 2022 and will likely end in March-June 2023.  Job gains will likely slow to 100k by October and turn negative for a 6 to 9 months.  If you are bearish, consider ending that by September-October.  Markets can sniff out the end of a recession and stocks generally turn up well before the end of the recession.  This will be no different.  Stocks can go up in 2023 despite bad news on the economic front.  I expect markets to turn up by November as inflation turns down fast (wage inflation will collapse by December as job losses appear).|2022-07-01 11:12:55

efxner|vox64k|vox64k|14|"What's wrong!?" Your wife runs into the kitchen. She heard you dry heaving from the back bedroom. She finds you standing over the sink, hands on the edge, shaking your head.  She puts a hand softly on your back and asks again, more calmly this time, "What's wrong?" You look up from your distorted, chrome reflection in the bottom of the sink and smile at her. "Nothing. I think it's just my medicine. I'll be fine." She stares at your face for a moment longer, then nods, satisfied with your answer. She returns to the bedroom to get ready for work.  You return to your reflection, and you don't recognize yourself. You didn't exactly lie to her. It's just that the medicine you meant was the bottom shelf vodka you drank last night, not the new anti-depressant she knows you are supposed to be taking. You hate the way vodka makes you feel the next morning, but you've learned through trial and error that people are less likely to smell it on you than they would bourbon.  You reach for your phone and see pre-market is still mostly flat or red. All those calls. All those far out-of-the-money calls. Expiring today. You dry heave again and yell, "I'm fine!" to prevent her from coming to check on you again. After all, you don't want her to see you pouring another drink.|2022-07-01 07:08:15

Bear Stearns ended up sold for $2 per share to JPM after trying to negotiate a much higher deal.  The problem is that there's potentially a Lehman moment in the wings: MSTR imploding.  I think Saylor almost certainly gets wrecked if we see corn fall to 4 figures.  Given just how many "worse than Madoff" ponzi schemes were hiding in corn (that woman that stole $4 billion is just the latest in a long line of shitshows), I feel reasonably confident that we see Saylor implode before corn bottoms.|2022-07-01 06:46:17

ehc449|vox64k|vox64k|4|It’s all wrong , by rights we shouldn’t even be here, but we are. It’s like in the great market rallies Mr. Frodo, the ones that really mattered, full of gay bears and FUD they were,  and sometimes you didn’t want to know the closing price, because how could it be green,  how could the market go back to the way it was when so much loss had happened. But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow, even darkness must pass, a new rally will come, and when it moons it will moon out the harder. Those were the rallies that stayed with you, that meant something, even if you were too regarded to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand, I know now, traders in those markets had lots of chances of selling at a loss only they didn’t, because they were holding on to something.  What are we holding on to Sam?  That there's some tendies left in this market, and they're worth fighting for|2022-07-01 13:11:48

That's almost 50% in 6 months. We are now in a far more overleveraged/bought on margin market with a complete change in the guard happening with interest rates and inflation.  And you morons think we've bottomed at $280 😂😂😂 still up 10X over those 2008 lows? The selling won't be over until QQQ is under 100 and SPY is under 200|2022-07-01 08:55:17

Also there are some major potential catalysts coming this month, including earnings pre announcements which are expected possibly next week.

ehi3jj|vox64k|vox64k|0|I have 100 shares of AMD at 95$ avearge for a long term hold.   Few days ago i sold a covered call with a strike of 95$ for AMD, 29 July expiration.   I sold it because I believe AMD won't reach that number by July 29 and if it does - I don't mind having my poistion (100 shares) sold as it will be for breakeven.   Right now the covered calls I sold are up 76% as the stock plummeted since I started the position and my question is:   In order to collect the premium (1.13$ per contract so 113$), do I have to wait until July 29 or can I just close the position right now (buy 1 call of same contract) and take 76% gain instead of waiting another month for just 25% more?   Hope my question is clear|2022-07-01 13:52:59

eglt04|vox64k|vox64k|-13|I studied English in college. Yes, that makes most people laugh. But I also make more money than most people, so whatever.  A metaphor that is common in literature is that the pussy is a peach. I never really got this. When I was a young man, working at a farm market, I would sometimes spend 4 hours straight in peach bins, putting them into smaller containers for sale. It was itchy work. Pussy work isn't exactly easy, but I can't say it's ever been itchy.  Also, when you first taste pussy, it's an experience of copper and blood and pennies and life. It's wonderful. But, wow, is it not like the sweet punch that is peaches.  But I think the point of the metaphor is that both *are forbidden*. Did you know it takes three years before a fruit tree can give you fruit? Did you know that even after that, you need a cosmic level of good luck with weather and bugs and timing to find a ripe fruit?  Edit: Oh wow, this place forget it's shitpost roots. I guess the Bear market really is on. Everyone is on edge.  The metaphor is about the rareness. It's about getting to eat something you underestimate and absolutely don't deserve. Have respect for both. You are bearing witness to a billion years of evolution at work. You don't deserve this.|2022-07-01 10:14:51

What if we should plan out portfolios to deal with this elevated inflation, and not a depression  What if all the data that has been going on for years showing signs of an inflationary spiral is signaling a … inflationary spiral and not a deflationary recession  Basically what I’m saying is what if the signs that point to inflation are pointing to inflation  This is out there I know|2022-07-01 13:48:41
