2smn4l|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|38|Getting really tired of the half-veiled scorn and ridicule that the taking heads of finance heap onto the “retail investor/speculator”. They’re constantly saying stupid shit like, “this asset bubble has been driven in part by the exuberance of the Robinhood traders.”  That’s not the case. What is the case is that smart money can’t seem to get a handle on how to position against a bunch of degenerate gamblers willing to put every penny they own on the line and never let go of positions. Playing poker and never folding a hand - and so all that’s left to the financial elite is to sit there with a smug little smirk and say essentially, “they don’t know how to play poker.”|2020-08-25 07:56:10

2slr3v|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|17|Treasury thoughts: Not feeling great about bond yields (and thus my short TLT puts) heading into the Thurs Fed meeting. We already know he won't be talking about using yield curve control anytime soon. We also know the Fed is dumping treasuries on the market increased supply, but also buying to inflate the balance sheet.   But the real problem is the move to let inflation float higher toward 4%, which makes debt less appealing to hold, which sucks for long dated treasuries. Extra worse, it means longer term they'll have to raise rates to counter the higher inflation. However, it also means they'll hold off on that move for longer.  The real question then is, will the inflation they're measuring via CPI actually reflect the reality of assets like houses and cars, where inflation is already spiking? We're seeing in real time that the dollar is falling, and with that the value of outstanding debt obligations and their coupons. Where's the floor?|2020-08-25 07:46:16

2shse2|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|13|13 When Jesus heard that tech stocks were down, he took a personal loan and deposited it into Robinhood. Hearing of this, the WSB Autsitcs followed his plays.   14 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and told them to Dump their Apple calls  15 As evening approached, the autistics came to him and said, “This is a risky play, and the company is trading at 1000 PE. Send the Boomers to buy XOM/BA/INTC/GE so that they may go live on 3% yield.”  16 Jesus replied, “They do not need to sell. We will give them a YOLO.”  17 “We have here only $500 in our Robinhood accounts and rent is due in 5 days,” they answered.  18 “Bring this $500 here to me,” he said. And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the $500 and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks to Lord Elon and bought 10 5DTE $2000c. Then he gave the play to the retards, and those retards gave to more retards.   20 They all hit 100 baggers, and the retards then went all in on $2100 0DTE with screams of REEE and MEMES.....and nothing was leftover.   21 The number of those who roped themselves were many, except one retard who accidentally bought puts.|2020-08-25 06:57:57

Thing is though, it's irrelevant. Inflation is *not* above 2%, and it hasn't been for years and years. Just look at the data.  [https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/)      Inflation was at 2.3% before the pandemic and then took a plunge.

If stocks hits 177.5 or higher I make 1300$ 300 from 3 dollar jump plus 1,000$ from premium. I miss out on any further gains though. If it goes down I keep the premium and get only lose money if BA drops below 164.50 as the 1,000$ premium covers that cost. Is there any holes in this strategy. Except obviously if BA just tanks, I plan on holding for long term though. And I plan to repeat the strategy monthly|2020-08-25 13:46:26

It's okay i'm okay with the loss it was a gamble and i wrote it off before i even bought it, it's like 15% of my port whatever i will recover.  What i need help with is figuring out how much TSLA stock has to go up for me to break even? like if tsla goes to 2200 by say wed or thursday, is that enough to make my contract move or am i fucked due to theta no matter what price tsla goes to? unless it hits 2366.77 which is my break even price?    Overall what are my odds of surviving my autist move. 1% ? i'm praying to like six different Gods right now.

2tahm9|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|3|Missed the boat on BABA after taking a loss on earnings. Pretty salty, I wanted to buy LEAPS but most of my capital is tied up in covered calls until September 18. Lesson learned, keep cash on hand for when things seem irrational. **What are your views on BABA Jan 2022 upside?** Still enough juice?  **What are your thoughts on WMT?** I still think WMT Jan 2022s will be money. COVID is just a consolidator of capital towards the companies big enough to survive / thrive regardless of economic / pandemic conditions. Wealth consolidation towards those in higher $$$ brackets will also mean more people getting squeezed out of the middle class, and increased traffic through depression-resistant / more economical businesses like Walmart, dollar tree, Etc. Plus, decreased competition from all the business not large enough to survive (which I think we have not necessarily seen the worst of yet). I also think their continued expansion into eCommerce will be fruitful going forward.   WMT Catalysts: Walmart+, continuing strategic investments in technology, macroeconomic conditions.   What are your thoughts?|2020-08-25 11:06:24

2tymzy|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|3|So yesterday it was announced Luminar Tech is reverse merging with the spac under the symbol  GMHI. I didn’t find out about it until today and it seems like the market hasn’t really caught on to it either yet. Luminar Tech is in the EV market except they aren’t building cars, they are building autonomous vehicle tech so these future cars can actually drive autonomously, they already have deals with BMW and Volkswagen, and their tech is apparently the only AI that is between 3-5 grade autonomous vehicle for reference Tesla’s is 1-3.

2tqg1t|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|9|APPL idiots, learn to read a chart.  The sudden spike in Apple price over news created a vacuum. Too much movement too fast. Like how NIO is moving today.  The market gotta pump them breaks.  AKA people that saw big gains want out for them profits, just like you do.  Then all the Appl-diots that wanted in for the split gonna panic sale, price dips lower.  Then the smart long apple players buy back in, bringing it back up to an appropriate growth price, a stability point.  $495 in this case.  It's going to fuck around $495 till power hour.  Then we might see some more buying in.  It'll creep up towards $500 throughout the week, gaining about a dollar or two a day.  Friday it might take off, might not, depends on the rest of the market. The stock went from $386 to near $500 in a week.  It's not going to die, it's not going to bottom out.  It's going to keep doing what it does.  The little engine that could.  Shit or get off the pot, it's going to be around for a long time.     TLDR: shut up about Apple, your either in it for the long game or you missed the bus.|2020-08-25 13:07:20

Do not fucking hold through ER. Just hold until that shit hits 218 u greedy fucks.  $HON (Honeywell) wait for profit taking. Calls when it dips to $160. Hold until 167.  $AMGN (Amagen) wait for profit taking. Calls when it goes down to 242. Hold until 245.  EDIT: Some of those calls might just run and not dip.  $AAPLE. Apple will run today from reorganizing Dow. Balls deep in Calls.  Down the road look at $XOM $RTX and $PFE for overreaction plays. But doubt they coming back today.  Have not looked closely enough at $TSLA yet, to see where it will bounce, but once it does, Calls like a motherfucker. Key resistance at 1967, 1892, 1858, 1836    Bank Calls are a no brainer, but must sell before JPOW speaking at the HOLE on Thursday. Further, I would sell every Ting you own on the lead up to our savior JEROME POWELL.|2020-08-25 07:43:19

2ssxkc|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|2|Looks like SRNE finally hit the bottom of its downward spiral THANK GOD.  Literally lost $200k of gain from the top.  Didn't take profits because I'm a degenerate gambler and most of my holdings are still deep ITM options and shares that date back to when the stock was in the $2s.  Also, LULU announced earnings for 9/8.  That gives us all 3 weeks to 2.5x our money each week by buying spreads.  I have my 370c and 370/375 and 370/380 spreads this week, and then on Friday we'll add to my 375 call for 9/4 with some spreads of whatever the stock price is at.  If LULU stock splits, it's gonna be 8 to 1.  The company loves 8s.  Most items it sells end with an 8.  It'd near $500 like apple pre-split because it has 90% institutional ownership.|2020-08-25 08:58:49

The price jumped 15% today alone and it's beyond my call option strike price.  What's weird is that Robinhood is letting me sell those call options again at higher bid price and it's asking me again to put 400 shares as collateral. Just curious how is that possible since I only own 400 shares which were already put as collateral when I sold mh first four call options?|2020-08-25 12:29:14

2tluhg|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|2|Looking for a pullback in SQ to get in.  I can see this stock doubling over the next couple of years but right now it has gone parabolic and I will wait to get in.  I am pairing back my NVDA. I was buying at 200 so it is time to take more profits while we are at the highs.  PSTG is reporting earnings tonight.  I am going to hold it.  I believe we either go to 20 or come back down to 15.  I think STOR hits 30+ after they report earnings this quarter. They will show that they have been collecting rents and companies are working to re-open.  It is counter-intuitive with all the business closing.   Started a position in WYNN.  It has run up a few dollars and I believe it is good for a trade up to 90.  WYNN is starting to get conference bookings for Jan.  this is a very important indicator for all hotels and travel.  This is a great sign but they are booking these conferences with no cancelation fees.  Covid has to become less of an issue by the end of the year for companies to keep these conferences.  For now, we are going in the right direction.  Companies I want to get into or add to my position are SQ, DIS, VIAC, JPM, HP, BWA, WYNN.|2020-08-25 12:30:59

The Justice Department is planning to charge Teva as soon as Tuesday after the company rebuffed a settlement that would have required paying a criminal penalty and admitting wrongdoing, said the person, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.  A spokesperson for Teva, which is based in Israel, declined to comment.

My position: **HFC$26C 9/18** \- US refiner that has zero gulf-coast exposure and can take advantage of pricing  and SELLING calls on XOM <- they are shit and just got kicked out of the DOW and hurricane is bad for their portfolio  Other plays: CVX - has some GC exposure, but very diversified and the best managed Super-Major.   MPC - refiner with 2 major refineries that may impact about a third of their capacity, but will take advantage in other markets.

2sznxn|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|2|Posted this in the weekend thread, but didn’t get much feedback: What are the real risks with buying calls in 2022 and selling weeklies? If you truly believe the stock will go up, why not ride the wave and collect premiums along the way. Usually the premiums on the 2022 calls aren’t unreasonable. You can regain initial investment in 20-30 weeks then everything after is just icing on the cake. Can someone please tell me why I shouldn’t do this before I get screwed trying it?|2020-08-25 09:51:16

2tf3cx|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|2|LULU broke 380 way ahead of schedule.  I've been super bullish, and this is awesome.  We'll hit 390s next week and maybe even 400s ahead of earnings (last time it cracked 300s leading up to earnings hype, which it flopped, and now it's up like $100/share from when it crashed before announcing the Mirror acquisition).  Very excited to make \~4k this week from my calls & spreads, and then we'll roll it into next week to hopefully make \~10k.  Earnings is 9/8 AH.  Gonna be holding very little into the earnings call b/c it will be a gamble.  LULU has flopped 3 times in a row after earnings calls.  Super risky to gamble on them turning it around this time around.  Q3 call in December will be \*very different\*.  However, if LULU announces an split like I'm thinking they might, it'll hit $500 pre-split like Apple due to its 90% institutional ownership.  I'd love to see an 8-1 split, but it'll probably be closer to 4 or 5.|2020-08-25 11:39:53

2twgtt|ig9cdo|ig9cdo|-6|why would AAPL or TSLA moon for the rest of the week?  &#x200B;  The shareholders getting the split were in last Friday so why would people run up TSLA this week?  Replace TSLA with AAPL and it's the same story.  What's stopping MM from dropping the stocks now the hype is gone so they don't pay out so many 5-1 as it would have been on the 21st. In additon to doing so all the FOMO from the last 100-200 point climb would be pointless to hold if it drops 5% cause they could rebuy when it splits and it would be the exact same.|2020-08-25 13:55:07
