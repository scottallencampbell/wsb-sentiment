774axu|j2jg0e|j2jg0e|20|I interviewed with Palantir a few years ago--that is, they made me go through a 7-interview process--and I've never been so underwhelmed in my life (not that I didn't enjoy the free trip to Palo Alto). The people there were arrogant about what they did, even though they couldn't explain what they did, and they were all miserable. At the end of my last interview, I politely explained I was no longer interested like this: "Look, I know I a lot of talented people apply to work here, so I'm not exactly expecting to be fawned over. But *no one* I met during this entire interview process seemed to enjoy working here, so why would I want to?" I'm a victim of my blue collar roots, I know, but it was the fakest experience of my life. Everything about its external façade was total bullshit. Even the name, Palantir. I expected someone to mention Lord of the Rings to me *once* during the interview process, to explain the ethos or even just the interest, and that never happened. It's a Silicon Valley Frankenstein's monster, except with none of the monster's redeemable humanity.|2020-09-30 13:01:58

Didn't cash out at $2,000 profit and then panic sold on the half pump for $600  \- Watched it plummet down to like 3140  \- FOMO'd back in with a 3120p and then panic sold at a -$1,500 loss like 3:45 with it pumping back  \- Did exactly the same as above with SPY at the same time since they are in almost lockstep  \- Could have been up $3,000 on the day. Instead with paper hands and FOMO i'm down $831  That September crash where I lost half my portfolio from ATH has complete rocked me.

Perhaps they're squabbling over how strong the liability protections would be?     The only viable path I see to a stimulus is if McConnell increases his offer for state and local funding, while Pelosi in exchange allows the liability protections to be in the bill. So if that's the grand bargain they're seeking, she might be waiting for revised language on liability protections.     I have puts|2020-09-30 14:34:07

Old timer's who have been out of the cockpit for as long as he has don't just jump back in to "put the 737 to the test".

You can even look at my post history; I’d be getting -2 and -3 for saying bull comments last week because the retarded bears were buying puts at the bottom.

There is *zero* long term risk in equity markets at this point.|2020-09-30 14:52:31

Mnuchin goes over every inch of it and explains in detail why that's too many inches for his tender butthole.  Wednesday: Mnuchin shows up to meet with Pelosi, slams a $1.5T package on the table and says let's compromise, let me fuck you over just before the election with this smaller, more reasonable package size. Pelosi says no way that package is not big enough for my cavernous vagina. You gotta get it up to at least $1.8T, must be this big to ride  Wednesday night: Both people walk away mad and announce that the last hope for a compromise has broken down.

Palantir can be a divisive company that draws strong opinions from supporters and critics.

One night at one of these Sunday dinners, the wife gets fed up. She looks at her husband and says, "What's the matter? You don't talk?"  The husband looks at her and says, "What should I say?

772w9y|j2jg0e|j2jg0e|7|Palantir is a shit company. They aren't even SaaS or cloud based. They are more like a consulting company that integrates their product with every customer by deploying engineers on site. Yeah, they have a few DoD contracts but nothing what they do translates to assured revenue like SaaS companies.      Source: Interviewed there as a software engineer a few years ago but they pulled a bait and switch saying it was a "Forward Deployed Engineer" position. It's a glorified consulting role.      A similar horror story: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50csfd/long_rant_about_drawnout_negative_interview/      PS: Palantir had no plans to go IPO for years. They saw the hype in equity markets of late and decided to. Same with AirBnb, after holding out for years.|2020-09-30 12:52:43

779mgz|j2jg0e|j2jg0e|4|Don't let this pullback on NIO fool you. This shit is primed for a breakout. Its just because it hit ATH today that some are taking profits and some bears are hoping on. Friday (not sure when), they release September order numbers, which they already told us were expected to be up. This should drive NIO higher.   Unusual options activity was also detected on the 10/16 25c and 27c. Now that could signal large amounts of writing, but there were several sweeps, so it may indeed be buying. I think with the bullish news of rising orders, its probably buying. This dip is a good chance to get in.|2020-09-30 13:37:00

76641e|j2jg0e|j2jg0e|2|The terms of billions in federal airline aid expire early Thursday, setting the stage for more than 30,000 job cuts.  Airline executives including the CEOs of American, United, Southwest and JetBlue have been making last-ditch attempts in Washington to persuade lawmakers and Trump officials to provide additional aid as the job cuts loom as early as this week.    “This isn’t about raising funds for the airline,” American Airlines CEO Doug Parker told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday. “This is about keeping the infrastructure in place by having us be paid to pass on to our team members who we otherwise don’t have work for to keep them in place.”  The CARES Act Congress passed in March included $25 billion — mostly federal grants — for passenger airlines to pay workers through Sept. 30, in hopes that a recovery in travel demand would materialize this summer. It didn’t. Airport statistics show demand stuck at around 30% of last year’s levels and carriers continue to bleed cash. Airline executives don’t expect a return to 2019 volumes for several years.  The proposal for additional aid has won bipartisan support from lawmakers and the Trump administration but the two sides haven’t reached an agreement on a new national coronavirus bill. A $2.2 trillion package unveiled by House Democrats on Monday includes the additional airline aid, and talks have progressed with the White House in recent days.   https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/federal-airline-coronavirus-aid-expires-tonightving-way-for-more-than-31000-job-cuts.html|2020-09-30 08:51:56

Their other product Foundry is essentially data warehouse + data pipeline + analytics suite all rolled into one. Both products specialize in handling organizations with very complex data and infrastructure needs, which is why other products in both of those markets often aren’t sufficient.  Notably, they don’t do anything around data collection (their software sits on top of existing data sources) or sophisticated ML/AI/data mining (there’s a little, but their main focus is human-driven analysis)|2020-09-30 12:55:00

If it does, we can change the daily trend back in favour of the bulls.  If we bust below 319.80, we can easily go back to 285 on SPY for that juicy gap fill. I personally would happily go all in at SPY 285.|2020-09-30 13:49:00

You've heard it 100 times already, you know deep down that its true but you don't want it to be so because you see signs that the economy is not doing so well so you want to be a bear. Bears are gay and you weren't born gay so instead be a bull and buy stonks and calls. Wash your bear feelings away and embrace the bull.|2020-09-30 05:41:42

75srg9|j2jg0e|j2jg0e|3|NIO looks strong pre-market.  Watch for early selling on the gap up though, there's probably going to be some profit taking the first 2 hours just because of how big the positive move has been since yesterday morning while the rest of the market has basically been selling off.  Especially with that clusterfk of a debate last night.  Last time NIO broke out like this, it gapped up on the 2nd day of the run and then sold off early before running up the rest of the day.  The key level imo is around $21.14 (previous breakout ATHs), as long as it stays above that early in the day it should be good for a run up to $22+.  There will likely be resistance/support at every whole dollar figure ($21/22/23) based on how NIO traded after breaking out last time.|2020-09-30 06:08:30

On Tuesday they confirmed that their services are offline (in 400+ facilities), stock started to go down, reached 100. Then it went to 102 before close. Today it's opening on 103 and quickly goes back to 107 WITH NO NEW UPDATES.

76n6me|j2jg0e|j2jg0e|4|This entire market is being kept afloat by manipulated and hand picked data, when the reality is much more grim.  How many articles do we have to see where massive large cap employers are slashing tens of thousands of jobs... and I’m sure this is amplified in the small business space.  But don’t worry, money will magically appear in those unemployed workers pockets and they’ll buy the things companies sell in order to generate revenue and pay dividends.  Inflation is a myth, and it’s the only thing that’s driving this mindless macro pump.  How much longer will the fed inject liquidity into the banking system to buy equities before its obvious it’s all a scam.  They’ve been able to pull it off so far, so maybe it’s not a stretch to think they can keep the facade up until a vaccine is widely distrusted in late 2021.  How much irreparable damage will be done by then?|2020-09-30 11:08:23

Yet somehow Elon is the second coming of Christ, Tesla is going to save the planet, and every EV company's stock gets bid up in price to the moon. Tell me more about how "traditional fuels are dead!" and this is the start of a revolution. Has Tesla announced an EV cargo ship that won't burn bunker fuel and dump tons of NO into the air? Is NIO developing a 0 emissions power plant? No, but GE and Hitachi have been producing those for years . They're called  nuclear reactors.

Even if that doesn't mean its drilling all day, its definitely found a leg down after those two and lost its morning momentum.

76gb8m|j2jg0e|j2jg0e|0|AA - Alcoa calls from 12.50-14.00 on 10/30. Just sayin'.  Potential stimulus, their earnings is mid october, Boeing is end of month, aluminum up 13% since July, still way off pre-covid levels --many potentially super bullish catalysts.  Not the most exciting company to play, but the calls are cheap despite being a month out so if you want to play those catalysts you could get more bang for your buck.  The week leading up their mid-July earnings they went from $10.50 to nearly $14. Leveled off around $13 before running up to touching $16 in August and then around mid/low $15 before September crash where they got hit hard along with Boeing.|2020-09-30 10:21:42
