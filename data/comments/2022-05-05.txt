There's no categorical reason for "e-commerce to die," shopping online is hugely beneficial for a wide variety of products assuming you have the minimal required trust in the storefront.

Traders responded harshly to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report, and instead sought refuge in commodities like oil, natural gas and handjobs"***  Like the retail herd of borderline retards was the ones that had the market moving, rather then big firms and Hedge Funds pumping and dumping. A more truthful text would read     >***"Big Money does it again - Wednesday had dumb money slammed in the ass once again as a clever baiting for a relief rally had unsuspecting commoners adopt a bullish sentiment. Hopeful amateurs continued buying hard into what would become an absolute slaughter as soon as the next day as firms unrelentingly dumped their overvalued assets, passing their bags along to overconfident amateur traders where it belongs."***|2022-05-05 13:03:33

7ftg14|uiu294|uiu294|16|Here's your problem bulls.  Productivity numbers today showed productivity is taking a nosedive. Meanwhile, the gap between the number of job openings and job seekers keeps widening.  Wages keep going up.  Productivity is not keeping up with wage gains, and given the tight labor market, it means we have significant cost-push inflation.  Prices moon --> workers demand more salary --- > tight labor market means workers have leverage --> salaries moon but productivity doesn't keep up -- > producers' margins are squeezed; therefore, they raise price. Rinse and repeat over and over again.  Rising wages sounds nice for the middle class, but data also show real wages after inflation are negative, meaning the middle class is actually losing purchasing power due to inflation even though they're seeing wage gains.  This is a much more serious and difficult problem than inflation driven by consumption, which the Fed can combat more easily.  Cost-push inflation is more permanent and much stickier.  The story that inflation has peaked and that a soft landing is possible is absolute horseshit.  The only way to stop this from spiraling out of control is through a recession.  It will get much uglier from here on out.|2022-05-05 10:50:32

Processing the 2020-2021 growth spurt while dealing with high inflation will put a crimp on earnings as they try to bring down costs from rapid expansion.  Fortunately for AMZN, around 60-70% of its market cap comes from AWS so it's much more of a cloud play now than a retail/e-commerce play like it was 10 years ago.  (That's also why AMZN can recover from this weakness much quicker than the rest of the e-commerce names).|2022-05-05 07:51:04

7ep69w|uiu294|uiu294|8|I will laugh my fuggin' ass off if you bulls are out of gas already after a small lame pump to 4300 and we drill for the rest of the week.  The funniest part is you all still believe Powell that a soft landing is possible.  The same Powell who said inflation is transitory and who is way behind in fighting inflation and removing money. These bull rallies keep reaching lower and lower highs while drillings keep going lower. Look at the damn chart, market is negative YTD.  Pretty soon it'll sink in that the idea that you can have a pro-growth  environment while trying to clamp down on 40 year highs in inflation does not make sense. We end in a recession.|2022-05-05 05:13:18

Soon it will sink in that a minimum of 50 bps at each meeting from now until indefinitely, plus a ramp up of QT is not bullish for GDP growth.  Shit, this is like the first time in history we've had to deal with QT, and one knows how the market will deal with it.  The money shredder will now be turned on.

Add money you can miss on the downturn. And keep steady.  If you think the SPX would've gone to 5000, it will still. The fact that it's going down shouldn't chance your perspectives or thesis. Might take longer than you thought before, but it will.  Take a breath. Uninstall your broker's app and/or keep adding (automatically) every paycheck.

7fb6iz|uiu294|uiu294|2|I'm most concerned about the perma bulls that are newer retail investors.  The FED can move markets to a point.  The reality is if the economy continues to slow and we slide into a recession that can have a cascading effect.    We just had the highest rate hike in 20 years and the markets bounced because they think the fed is being more dovish.  Just think about all of this long term.  Inflation is still high.  We don't even know that it's peaked yet.  Supply chains have actually gotten worse.  The economy contracted and there are already signs that could be the case this quarter.  There are potential food shortages upcoming and more energy shocks due to the Ukraine war.    There are honestly too many things to list right now that alone would be considered ominous.  If we see some of these things happen that will have a massive impact on the housing market.  Thats where the inventory will stem from and then the housing market completely flips and have a possible crash there as well.  Things could be beyond ugly the second half of this year.    If your a swing or day trader I wouldn't be all that concerned.  You can make money in any market. If your a buy and hold type of investor the probability you get absolutely fucked the second half of the year are very high.  Just be careful out there.  The FED is going to be very limited this time around.  Just my two cents.|2022-05-05 08:46:09

7g7xpg|uiu294|uiu294|-3|Deep value play on earnings today: GoPro   Down 6% today with the rest of the market, but at a $1.3bn market cap, it trades at 1x annual revenue and 4x debt-adjusted cash. COVID ending means more people buying vacation and travel gear and that means overpriced cameras that they won't use more than a few times.   Q1 is historically their weakest quarter but at these valuations it's worth a flyer. Street is expecting 6c EPS but they've beat the past four quarters. And btw it has an 11% short interest, so another quarter of profits could mean covering.   Don't sleep on GPRO|2022-05-05 12:30:54
