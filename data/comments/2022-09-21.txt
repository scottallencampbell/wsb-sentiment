l0fno8|qvwu4g|qvwu4g|9|Two possible paths (duh stonks go up or down):  1. This is a repeat of September 7 when AAPL was up strongly in a false breakout while SPY/SPX was down (very rare for there to be these types of divergences except at turning points when money rushes to safety).  After that, we went through a 5% market selloff. 2. This is just a small cap backtest of previous February 2021 highs (we're close to touching those levels on IWM/Russell 2000).  This happened last year at the start of the small cap breakout on November 12, 2020.  Either way, we're probably looking at an explosive move somewhere (big caps or small caps) next few weeks. AAPL and IWM are probably where you want to look to see what's going on...  I think either we see AAPL go on an all out blitz up to $165+ or we see IWM go up to $250+ by December.  I can be wrong of course.  FWIW, I'm leaning to the bullish side on this divergence since we already had a 5% selloff recently and fund inflows are hugely biased towards US Equities right now.|2021-11-17 11:34:31

Boomer Cramer doesn't even know what a GPU is.

Earnings will be good but will rek the stock regardless, because they'd need to report like 1,000% quarterly growth to justify their price.  Intel is actually solid, but beaten down.   When Nvidia drops, investors will be looking for an undervalued tech lifeboat to park their cash. They've already been setting up Intel for this by holding the price down this week with bid/ask spread fuckery.    Don't buy Nvidia puts. Buy Intel calls.

That guy is every bear.  We are in a market where you can throw a dart at a board and make money. You can throw everything into SPY and get 30% gains yearly.  But bears care more about being right one time, ignoring the six thousand times they were wrong, than making money. SPY dips a 1% and they celebrate like they just won the Super Bowl.  Youd have to be really bad at this to constantly lose money.    Bears, maybe its time to just close your accounts and stop trading? At the very least, stfu?|2021-11-17 09:52:07

That was always super fucking retarded of me considering they'll happily sell rooftop solar panels complete with installation on buildings so far north that they're less effective than they would be on the average EV.  Looking back from 2021 it's even more retarded considering they still haven't gotten around to putting solar panels on a vehicle even though there's been so much time for production to ramp up and the extra profit from charging a premium for vehicular panels would have contributed to that ramp up by now.

Can anyone name me examples of that concept in Russian culture long before Stalin issued order #227?   Can anyone name me examples of that concept being mentioned in writing, from any culture, from before that culture actually had people being systemically targeted?   Can anyone name me examples of that concept in regions with no centralized system that could insidiously target individuals, such as decentralized tribal lands or long-contested sparsely-populated border regions?
