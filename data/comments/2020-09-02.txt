3r1vov|il43tr|il43tr|17|Interesting that AAPL and TSLA are the exact same chart today.  What can we take from that?  Apple isn't really a growth stock, TSLA sure as fuck is, why are they moving in tandem?  Separate industries, wildly different fundamentals.  About the only thing they share in common is a kind of lifestyle reflection, more than Nike or Mercedes or Vesace, people identify who they are with these companies, either in by owning the product, or by participating as shareholders, or both.  So we have companies who are trading entirely on TA and sentiment.  TSLA in particular is sensitive to irrational swings.  A 5% dilution of shares caused a 12% drop in market cap in a little over 24 hours.  How can we make money on this?  People trading both of these companies tend to over react to negative news, because they have while owning and profiting from these companies feels really good - there isn't really an underlying justification for the valuation.  There is a feeling that the bottom could fall out at any time.  BUT - and this is important.  it is the self identification WITH THESE BRANDS that is actually the most enduring and valuable asset both have.  Bottom line?  When either of these companies gap down, buy short term options to capitalize on the rebound, once the gap is filled, resume with longer term options to capitalize on day over day gains.|2020-09-02 13:36:16

Germany's Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier told Musk "you'll have every assistance you need" during a meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's caucus group in Berlin, Bloomberg reported. Musk has been touring Germany since Tuesday. The factory would be the electric car maker's first European car plant, and could manufacture up to 500,000 cars a year.'|2020-09-02 12:26:11

TSLA 09/04 500c EVEN IF you nailed the bottom at $408 when the 500c was at $2.15 unless you sold it at the peak of the subsequent rally ($4.20 I think) Those contracts are now at $2.30 and the stock is 7% higher! BUY ITM FD's or BUY TIME if you need to go that far OTM to get something you can afford.

Besides, this way, when it *is* time to buy puts, you'll actually be able to afford them.|2020-09-02 07:49:48

Not only are they the de facto market leaders in the gpu market but they are now poised to breakout in data infrastructure, AI learning, AND upon news of the ARM acquisition,  they’ll be well settled in the mobile market with the help of ARMs patents and licenses.

3qjnlg|il43tr|il43tr|8|Ok honest question.   Why haven’t we all gotten on the Costco train? They are killing it right now. Overstock memed on a 3.8 billion market cap. Costco’s is 151 billion.   Costco makes a boatload of money from online sales and services plus if you have gone lately people aren’t just making their usual Costco runs. Costco was slow at the start of the previous fiscal quarter but it’s been booming this entire quarter. People are stocking up for ThE bIg SeCoNd WaVe as though this hasn’t been one continuous wave. They’re gonna smash earnings at the end of the month.|2020-09-02 11:38:25

Power award for customer  satisfaction in mortgage servicing in July. We have achieved this  milestone in each of the 7 years since becoming eligible.  * On August 10, 2020, Rocket Companies completed its initial  public offering ("IPO"). As such, it did not have any shares outstanding  or calculations of earnings per share for any periods prior to this  date. As of August 10, 2020, the Company had 100,372,565 of Class A  shares outstanding and 1,883,279,483 of Class D shares outstanding. An  additional 16,720,517 shares of Class A shares were reserved for  restricted stock units.|2020-09-02 15:12:24

They are things that labor under the illusion of being profitable; an accretion of sensory, experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that they won't expire worthless, when in fact every TSLA call expires worthless. Maybe the honorable thing for us bulls to do is deny our programming, stop buying TSLA calls, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight - brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.|2020-09-02 12:47:16

I won't be surprised if we soon see some analyst coming up with a $1000 pt, especially if NVDA manages to grab ARM, in that case $1000 should be very real very soon.|2020-09-02 05:51:21

3po1nf|il43tr|il43tr|4|I'm kinda of shocked by how much stock prices are changing in a day post Rona. These swings to the up and down, but mostly up is not scary but confounding. Like analysts pt upgrades causing 10% moves particularly since the years before it was a really big deal when stock price increase by an absolute value of 10-20 dollars for a low hundred ticker but now it's like these things need to swing 50-70 just because of the environment we're in. The market makers must be loving this shit with trading volume higher and the volatility in the bid/asks. Anyway markets are volatile as fk, and it's making me a bit nauseous.|2020-09-02 07:55:23

Like what can those analysts say to scare people into selling. The really funny thing is if people don't actually sell because they won't need the cash with all the unemployment and stimmy money they're getting and because they believe their returns will be so great that they bag hold for a really long time.   I feel really sorry for Jerome, trying so hard to get inflation and employment up but markets are like nah, we'll take your digital money and use it to inflate these assets because you're destroying the dollar instead of spending it on luxuries since we only need to buy necessities.

Rona will get a vaccine and treatment headlines that make people no longer fearful of it as the fatality rate keep falling. The repubs are definitely going to spin the markets = economy line and everyone will see how high the markets are and be like we can't stop this party.

3r30ut|il43tr|il43tr|14|Hello all,   What. A. Day. I’m happy to report that my money from selling 1.21 shares of TSLA last week at $441.01 is finally back in my ‘hood account and ready to be put to work again! Today marks one week I’ve been playing this game and I’m happy to report a 7.04% cumulative gain. Unfortunately instead of watching the market closely, I tuned into David Blaine’s *Ascension* attempt on YouTube. My goal when I had money in my account was to buy back into TSLA when it dropped below $430 so I could increase my % ownership of this great company, hopefully someday I can own like 1.25 shares or something crazy. What I missed however was as David Blaine rose up, Tesla crashed down to a buyable range this morning for me, and as David descended from the heavens, Tesla rose once again past my threshold. While I’m really happy for David, I’m really sad at the opportunity lost and since then, TSLA has tainted me between $435 and $455. Alas, if I don’t get to buy in today, I hope to be back in the game soon and increasing my plays!   My all you bulls see green, and may all the bears see red!   All the Best,   -Zak from South Dakota|2020-09-02 13:43:35

THIRD Time similar, flat and choppy for two days, sell for loss, next day 2500 price target.  These losses i took literally turned into 100-300% gains if i diamond hands so i'm going to diamond hands.  Since I am holding and am cursed this probably means it won't work out.

3r3qs6|il43tr|il43tr|3|Alright, since there seems to be a lot of confusion on how VIX can be going up.   ...big breath in  VIX goes up in the fall, VIX goes up after big pumps, VIX goes up when the market is stochastically overbought, VIX goes up before elections, VIX goes up in times of economic insecurity, VIX goes up during social unrest, VIX goes up when VIX has been underperforming for a while, VIX goes up during high unemployment, vix goes up when there is a massive difference in valuations between sectors.  It doesn't have to inverse SPY.  It is it's own metric.  SPY is at the extreme end of one of the largest rallies in history, and it is VERY overbought at the moment.  That doesn't mean it has to go down, but the LIKELYHOOD of it going down is RISING.|2020-09-02 13:48:13

3r8841|il43tr|il43tr|3|Damn, RKT what a ride.  1. Bought some boomer stocks right after the IPO at the top like a retard at 24 (5k invested). Watched it go to 17 and timidly trying to climb back for weeks while my portofolio was bleeding. 2. Decided to double down on it and bought some calls for the first time ever. Learned all about options and was even ready to exercice my options (bought 26c which meant the share had to be at 29+ to make any profit) 3. Since then, I bought blindly 10 calls  that have averaged a 40% return. My RKT calls were sold for 100%+ and still have some at 200%.  cliffs: RKT turned me into a retard|2020-09-02 14:15:59

3puckk|il43tr|il43tr|2|General question for put credit spreads, lets say my positions are the following:  Sold 10 September 18 $100 strike ABC Puts for $5  Bought 10 September 18 $95 strike ABC Puts for $3  I understand my maximum profit is $2000 and my maximum loss is $3000  The part where I am confused is on the following:  Lets say the options expire and the stock is worth $98. If i am understanding correctly, I would be REQUIRED to buy 1,000 shares of ABC for $100k, and I would promtply sell for $98k, so my total loss would be the $2000 initial credit - $2000 lost buying and selling ABC, so I would break even. My issue is that I do not have the capital to buy $100k worth of stock if the above scenario arises. My question is, do I have to separately purchase AND sell the stock when the option expire otm, or would the $2000 simply be subtracted from the credit that went into my account when I opened the spread?   I have had some nice early success buying naked calls, but want to learn to reduce my risk while investing. Thanks!|2020-09-02 08:44:29

The plan is to either wait just up until earnings to sell, or maybe even sell after earning since they’re anticipated to crush their ER. However, I don’t entirely understand the theta decay aspect. What is my risk by holding it closer to its ending date and what is the recommended play?|2020-09-02 13:05:59

3py5x9|il43tr|il43tr|4|Man this is so depressing.   I was up 6.5k in march. Lost it all. Was down to -2k a month ago. Made 3k this month. All of that while these things happened:  I had a TSLA call a month back that I immediately panic sold for 300$ loss. It was worth 22k more 3 days after.  I had 6 AAPL 122.5c 9/25 that I had a sell order for breakeven on the day of the split. I couldn't cancel it and RH sold them for that price. I could be up another 7k with them.  Yesterday I bought a TSLA 520c 9/25. Currently down 2k.   I basicly missed out on huge gains, one was my mistake, the other one cause RH fucked me up and now I actually lose my hard earned 3k from the past month within a few days. :(  I bought a couple of AAPL leaps though. Hopefully they will get me back.|2020-09-02 09:12:24

3qu46w|il43tr|il43tr|3|Sooo I got an idea. Blend in with Yang Gang UBI. Every year, everyone over 16-18 gets 1k deposited into a trading account where every person will be taught about financial literacy. If you leave 100% of your funds in the account for the year, JPOW deposits 2k into your account the next year. Cap it at like 5k a year or whatever. If you pull out your 1k, you only get 1k the next year. Imagine if every single person was investing. Give every person access to the money wealth transfer happening. People can invest in renewable energy companies if they choose, pick out companies they want to thrive. Let people have a seat, however small that is, at corporate America|2020-09-02 12:45:07

3r4e5n|il43tr|il43tr|2|"U.S. CBO sees FY20 federal budget deficit of $3.3 trillion amid coronavirus spending"   3.3T doesn't sound like that much, maybe we really can afford all those programs Bernie wants. With a 3.3T deficit, we were able to give everyone 2400 per month on top of unemployment and a $1200 check and the deficit already was at 1T before the Rona and the government gave so much more money to companies than the people.  the 2400/month alone would lift every recipient out of poverty. Reagan's war on poverty could have been won if the FED just printed poverty away.   Lets have a 2T deficit and give people UBI. The analysts already have touted the 1200 stimmy checks and 2400 unemployment money as the saving move that prevents the economy from really hitting the shitters. UBI obviously can only be good for the economy and will definitely buy my vote.|2020-09-02 13:52:25

3pqwph|il43tr|il43tr|1|People keep talking about markets are in a bubble but what if, inflation is increasing faster than reported by the FED and what we're seeing is not a "bubble" but asset prices higher due to decreased dollar value so if we actually accounted for inflation, the speed which stocks are going up would be "normal" to account for loss purchasing power of the dollar. This makes Tesla's crazy run seem not that bad if each dollar it goes up is worth like 1/10th the dollar pre-Rona. Thats being dramatic, but who knows what inflation really is, not the FED I'll you because my $1 McDouble should not have gone up to $2.50 in what 5 years at sub 2% inflation per year.|2020-09-02 08:18:07

Because all that liquidity they pumped into the system is going to make it easier and cheaper to buy out these people with those digital dollars. I guess its better overall than firing those people, so Jerome probably did good. But so much for saving jobs right Jerome? Should have put a clause on those digital dollars that stipulate, no job cuts damn it.|2020-09-02 09:09:01

Although I wonder if Tesla gonna get sued by one of those corporate law firms that go after companies for the slightest mis-step, for its decision to raise capital at ATM pricing because it "caused" shares to lose value for their class action clients who FOMOed. I could totally see that as the lawsuit, "my clients demand compensation for FOMOing in on your stock after you tweeted all these things that obviously hinted that you were making so much profit for each car you sold, why your stock no higher!

MJ was allowed to take a position and board seat in a sports gambling company. He is also the owner of a professional (well, that adjective is debatable) sports franchise in the hornets.   Tilman frittata is the majority shareholder in LCA. He also owns the rockets. LCA has strictly been casino gaming so far; table games, cards, etc. It was assumed they couldn't do sports because of his NBA ownership stake. That rule has clearly been thrown out the window now which opens up an entirely new line of revenue for LCA.  Get in cheap while you can.|2020-09-02 14:43:13

3pp8qf|il43tr|il43tr|-8|IF, 1 soldiers, you shall by and by, in judging of your own fortune, preserve the same feelings which you experienced a little before in the example of the fate of others, we have already conquered; for neither was that merely a spectacle, but, as it were, a certain representation of your condition. And I know not whether fortune has not thrown around you still stronger chains and more urgent necessities than around your captives. On the right and left two seas enclose you, without your possessing even a single ship for escape. The river Po around you, the Po larger and more impetuous than the Rhone; the Alps behind, scarcely passed by you when fresh and vigorous, hem you in.	  1   Here, soldiers, where you have first met the enemy, you must conquer or die; and the same fortune which has imposed the necessity of fighting holds out to you, if victorious, rewards than which men are not wont to desire greater, even from the immortal gods. If we were only about to recover by our valor Sicily and Sardinia, wrested from our fathers, the recompense would be sufficiently ample; but whatever, acquired and amassed by so many triumphs, the Romans possess, all, with its masters themselves, will become yours. To gain this rich reward, hasten, then, and seize your arms, with the favor of the gods.|2020-09-02 08:04:51
