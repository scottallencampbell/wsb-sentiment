3bdtww|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|48|If there is a deal, I honestly am happy for all ya'll bulls. Good for yall. Even now, I am blown away that there is a mini deal in the making that all sides are willing to accept, but you gotta look failure in the face, right? I am still holding because, at the end of the day, whats the difference at this point? Puts are worth like 45k when I last checked, probably less now. I'm going to wait for the formal announcement like I always planned. I hope for a miracle but it looks like a certainty that there is a deal at this point. Its worth a bit more depreciation for me to have certainty a deal is a reality.   Hope you bulls are making bank. Love this place. The original 65k I started playing with was itself capital gains off of about 22k I had in stock (the cash out was long term capital gains). So I guess, if I only cash out like...20k, or 25k, some pittance of an amount, I may avoid taxes this year. The rest of my moneys, of which \~250k is indexed (retirement accounts tho) is up,  still have 70k in cash, and with the write off, it mitigates my losses, but all of that is putting lipstick on a pig that is my huge failure here.   Looking forward to the rest of this afternoon and, one way or another, closing this chapter.|2019-10-11 10:32:34

Another thing to consider is AAPL is at their historic ATH and come next week will most likely drop a few % due to people taking profits.   Either way I am looking to long both AAPL and AMD and I won't pick a strike price too close to the money.   What would you autists do?|2019-10-11 11:16:02

Biden or Warren (whoever the Dems pick) will spend months attacking him for what hes done with China. They will keep building it up and building it up making it one of the biggest reasons why he shouldn't be elected. Then BOOM. Maybe 2 months or even weeks before election he slaps together a deal.

Meaning if you are a bear you are playing a roulette and betting on black/red against bulls ( casino). Statistically you would always lose in the long run.  &#x200B;  Conclusion: why the fuck to take a risk and try to find short term downward trends. Get yourself 2 years out call options and chill.

Volume isn't great, but there are some pretty liquid option strikes/expirations, bid/ask isn't super tight, usually within 2-3 cents. It briefly broke through its ATH the other day at \~53.15 and looks like it's gonna go for it again soon.

3b1p0r|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|1|I sold covered AMD $28.50c two weeks ago at huge premium that expire today. I meant to buy them back yesterday OTM, but got busy at work and it slipped my mind. Given the overall pre-market movement (which I expect to fade), I'm torn between buying them back at open at what will likely be 60%-70% of what I paid for them and keeping my shares for a potential run-up, or rolling the dice that we do fade/drop into close and they expire OTM. If they expire ITM and my shares get called away, it will still be a decently profitable net trade (10% in 8 weeks), but I'll have left a lot on the table.   tl;dr is AMD going to close over $28.50 today or is this trade pop a fakeout?|2019-10-11 08:06:17

3bj437|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|1|You could do that too. Now you can collect the premium for each call let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs 30 dollars profit to you. Times that by 10 and you made 300 dollars and it may not hit that strike price so your producing free cash flow. That‚Äôs not a bad idea but me personally I‚Äôd set it up in spreads. Collect a big premium on an ITM call with an expiration far out then some calls OTM for less premium. Now if you hypothetically know AMD is going down then you‚Äôll keep your shares and money but if it does stay ITM on one call you could still have 9 others that never hit their targets. Then you can keep repeating those same moves.|2019-10-11 11:30:55
