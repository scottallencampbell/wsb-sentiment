3bdtww|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|48|If there is a deal, I honestly am happy for all ya'll bulls. Good for yall. Even now, I am blown away that there is a mini deal in the making that all sides are willing to accept, but you gotta look failure in the face, right? I am still holding because, at the end of the day, whats the difference at this point? Puts are worth like 45k when I last checked, probably less now. I'm going to wait for the formal announcement like I always planned. I hope for a miracle but it looks like a certainty that there is a deal at this point. Its worth a bit more depreciation for me to have certainty a deal is a reality.   Hope you bulls are making bank. Love this place. The original 65k I started playing with was itself capital gains off of about 22k I had in stock (the cash out was long term capital gains). So I guess, if I only cash out like...20k, or 25k, some pittance of an amount, I may avoid taxes this year. The rest of my moneys, of which \~250k is indexed (retirement accounts tho) is up,  still have 70k in cash, and with the write off, it mitigates my losses, but all of that is putting lipstick on a pig that is my huge failure here.   Looking forward to the rest of this afternoon and, one way or another, closing this chapter.|2019-10-11 10:32:34

This is perhaps the greatest deal America has ever seen. Nobody is tough on me like China. Ask China, they thought very highly of me. Trust me, Xi is a great leader and we both have unmatched wisdoms. Great leader. Great. They’re going to buy more soybeans from our farmers. The best farmers in the world I tell you.

3bhrdz|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|5|I have some $$ and looking at 2 options:  1. buy 100 shares of AAPL and sell monthly OTM covered call options  2. buy 1000 shares of AMD and sell monthly OTM covered call options  I will choose a strike price that yield roughly equal % return, but AAPL pays a dividend and is way more stable whereas AMD can go to $50 and back to $30 in a month. Another thing to consider is AAPL is at their historic ATH and come next week will most likely drop a few % due to people taking profits.   Either way I am looking to long both AAPL and AMD and I won't pick a strike price too close to the money.   What would you autists do?|2019-10-11 11:16:02

3bz9w8|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|6|My take is that Mango will hold the trade war for as hold as he can (maybe even worse). Even for a majority of his campaign. Biden or Warren (whoever the Dems pick) will spend months attacking him for what hes done with China. They will keep building it up and building it up making it one of the biggest reasons why he shouldn't be elected. Then BOOM. Maybe 2 months or even weeks before election he slaps together a deal. It would undermine everything the dems built up and would be fresh in peoples mind when going to the polls.|2019-10-11 13:18:19

Meaning if you are a bear you are playing a roulette and betting on black/red against bulls ( casino). Statistically you would always lose in the long run.  &#x200B;  Conclusion: why the fuck to take a risk and try to find short term downward trends. Get yourself 2 years out call options and chill.

3ave62|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|2|We might be looking at a 3%+ day for $AAPL. Trade news and where we were in the upgrade cycle kept it down/muted for a lot of the year. The upgrade cycle shifting caused increased production, which made it hit ATHs recently. Hopes of a tangiable trade deal might send it rocketing off.

3bi5s4|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|2|DHI is in probably one of the cleanest uptrends I've seen. Made thousands from this ticker playing puts and calls as it's fairly predictable (despite looking volatile as shit on the daily chart) Basically always sells off in the morning and recovers, dips always seem to get bought up. Volume isn't great, but there are some pretty liquid option strikes/expirations, bid/ask isn't super tight, usually within 2-3 cents. It briefly broke through its ATH the other day at \~53.15 and looks like it's gonna go for it again soon. I'd say it could easily hit 55 by Nov. if anyone wants to hop on (holding some 10/18 53c myself that I plan on selling before EOD)|2019-10-11 11:20:26

3cifgl|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|3|A few months ago at the end of August there was a Friday just like this where there was a huge dump off before the bell, on a day with a bunch of China/trade talk, and all signs over the weekend (China) were pointing to a MAJOR red day on Monday. I had a shit ton of puts I bought right before the dump and literally took a beach mini-vacay that weekend...  That next Monday the market opened up green as hell, beyond all reason lol and I ended up losing $8k.  I wouldn't get too overly confident bears.. :)|2019-10-11 15:07:01

3b1p0r|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|1|I sold covered AMD $28.50c two weeks ago at huge premium that expire today. I meant to buy them back yesterday OTM, but got busy at work and it slipped my mind. Given the overall pre-market movement (which I expect to fade), I'm torn between buying them back at open at what will likely be 60%-70% of what I paid for them and keeping my shares for a potential run-up, or rolling the dice that we do fade/drop into close and they expire OTM. If they expire ITM and my shares get called away, it will still be a decently profitable net trade (10% in 8 weeks), but I'll have left a lot on the table.   tl;dr is AMD going to close over $28.50 today or is this trade pop a fakeout?|2019-10-11 08:06:17

3bj437|dgdkg2|dgdkg2|1|You could do that too. Now you can collect the premium for each call let’s just say it’s 30 dollars profit to you. Times that by 10 and you made 300 dollars and it may not hit that strike price so your producing free cash flow. That’s not a bad idea but me personally I’d set it up in spreads. Collect a big premium on an ITM call with an expiration far out then some calls OTM for less premium. Now if you hypothetically know AMD is going down then you’ll keep your shares and money but if it does stay ITM on one call you could still have 9 others that never hit their targets. Then you can keep repeating those same moves.|2019-10-11 11:30:55
