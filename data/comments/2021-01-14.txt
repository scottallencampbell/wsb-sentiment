WBS retards see not too much long stock, way to much short stock and start buying long stock. Then, WSB retards 💎 🤚 long stock and buy the fucking dips to get more long stock. Price go up. Dumb people short stock need long stock. Price go up more. WSB retards not sell, 💎🤚 until end. Price go up more. Retards still not sell, cause we retards but price go up more.

j7uk5v|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|122|*And right here let me say one thing: After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It was always my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight!   It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in the bull markets and early bears in the bear markets. I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine -- that is, they made no real money out of it.   **Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon.** I found it one of the hardest things to learn. But it is only after a stock operator has firmly grasped this that he can make big money...The reason is that a man may see straight and clearly and yet become impatient or doubtful when the market takes its time about doing as he figured it must do...The market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brain they cannot sit tight.*  ==============  - Lefèvre, Reminiscence Of A Stock Operator(1923)|2021-01-14 05:18:01

They’re up against over 2 million retards with absolutely no risk management skills who have been conditioned since March to endure 50% swings in net worth every god damn day. We’re greedy as hell, and don’t consider anything a win unless it’s at least a 300% return.   The crazy thing is that this current squeeze is based on this retard army holding **shares**, which inherently don’t have the same volatility as the FD’s we’re accustomed to. Also, there is no expiration. As such, the WSB retard army won’t sell... can’t sell... we don’t even know how to sell.   GME $60 EOM.

j8mgsj|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|28|This morning after the massive drop below $34 I was almost about to sell.  But then I thought of u/DeepFuckingValue.   I'd bought some $GME at $19 and masturbated a disturbing amount after yesterday's nutty gains. Like a fuckton of folks, I was a little retarded and bought a few more shares at the top as soon as the market opened. And it fell. And of course, it starts going up again before dropping down again to $33.84.   Again I was about to sell. But then I thought of u/DeepFuckingValue.   If one visionary autist can wait, then so can I. So even though I have bought much later than he has, I am compelled to remain in this ticker out of sheer respect for him. Also fuck Melvin.   ...sorry, too many words. All I'm saying is $GME  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀and if not then I'm ready to die with it.   Only when u/DeepFuckingValue announces that he cashes out will I sell. As I write this, I see the stock rise from $34.78 to $35.90. I'm not particularly religious but maybe it's a sign from Jesus, Cohen, Cramer, or maybe even DeepFuckingValue himself.   IF I CAN HOLD THEN SO CAN YOU. FUCK MELVIN. HOLD YOU LOVABLE DEGENERATES, HOLD!  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-01-14 10:05:28

j9icc0|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|22|Lol this sub made Wall Street journal now  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/gamestop-stock-soars-and-social-media-traders-claim-victory-11610653679  Probably pay wall here’s the article. Lot of words   Individual investors who recently piled into GameStop Corp. are taking a victory lap this week after shares of the struggling company surged more than 90% in the last two days, putting the stock on pace for its best weekly performance on record.   For weeks, members of Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum have been touting GameStop, encouraging others to scoop up shares lof the videogame retailer and begin making bullish bets. Several posts on the forum had noted that short sellers' bearish GameStop bets had been at elevated levels.   Short interest, which indicates the interest of investors betting a stock will fall in value, has hovered around 138% of the stock's free float this year, FactSet data show. This makes it the second-most shorted company across the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc., according to Dow Jones Market Data. That had some Reddit users predicting that the stock might rapidly rise if short sellers suddenly had to cover their bets by buying back shares should the stock suddenly rise in value.   This week, that forecast finally appeared to take shape after news of changes to GameStop's board sent shares climbing.   On Monday, the company said it had struck a deal to add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen and two former executives to the GameStop board.   The announcement pushed shares up 13% on the day. On Wednesday, gains accelerated and GameStop catapulted 57% higher, its biggest share-price jump in history. GameStop gained an additional 23% in midafternoon trading Thursday.   On Reddit Thursday, WallStreetBets users were celebrating GameStop's gains. Many posted screenshots of big wins from bullish options bets. Several talked about how they would spend their profits. One user posted that the experience demonstrates that the WallStreetBets forum "runs the market."   Once just a small presence in the financial markets ecosystem, retail traders are increasingly influential. Retail-trading activity has exploded within the last year as individual investors, many of whom are stuck at home, have begun to try their hands at trading.   More than 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened in 2020, JMP Securities estimates. And on peak trading days last year, individual traders are estimated to have accounted for nearly 25% of trading activity, Citadel Securities estimates. Through social media and the ability to make free stock trades, individual investors have been able to turn companies into market sensations -- GameStop being among the latest.   GameStop's rapid share-price moves, analysts said, were spurred by news of Mr. Cohen's addition to the board, as well as the company's announcement Monday that online sales sharply increased during the holidays. Mr. Cohen's investment firm has been building up a stake in GameStop and has urged the company to improve its online business. Mr. Cohen is known for the e-commerce savvy he displayed at Chewy, the pet-products online retailer.   That set the stage for the short squeeze, analysts and individual investors claimed.   "The shorts are freaking out," said Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities. Meanwhile, "Robinhood message boards are bragging."   One individual investor who was celebrating GameStop's win Thursday was Jackson Call, a 24-year-old trader. He had been seeing WallStreetBets users encouraging others to buy shares of the company in recent weeks.   "I was thinking 'GameStop? What in the world?'" said Mr. Call, a student in North Carolina. "I kept saying 'No way am I going to buy into this thing.'"   But this week he saw CNBC's Jim Cramer talking about GameStop. He decided to purchase roughly 80 shares of the company for slightly more than $20 apiece at the opening bell Wednesday, he said. That was right before the stock catapulted higher.   "I think it'll just keep marching higher because there's such a high short interest," Mr. Call said. He picked up more shares of GameStop Thursday when the stock briefly pared its early morning highs.|2021-01-14 14:03:27

j97rom|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|19|There's obvious wall at $41. We tried to break it for the second time and a huge red 2% candle welcomed us. It's very similar to what we had at $37. We tried to break it 4 times today. Once we got through though, we went up immediately another 5%.  My take: Once we break $41.20 we will have another big pump. Once again, I'm just a retard.|2021-01-14 12:43:15

Oh and we'll probably all worship /u/deepfuckingvalue shortly in the future.   Honorable mentions of other recent historic WSB events: the complete 180 regarding public opinion on Cramer, the initial run-up of PLTR and NIO when none of us could lose money, fool's gold such as NKLA, PRPL, RKT, people pledging to drink piss (or that one guy who is probably still with his shitty GF because PLTR stayed at $25)...

j9entp|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|17|You know what pisses me off the most?  The fact that these fuckers at Melvin have institutions backing them. A short squeeze **DOES NOT** look like this. If you study historical examples of short-squeezes you won't see pumps and dumps like here. There are major resistances at certain levels, like $37 and $41, where you could see these huge chunks of sell orders blocking the way through and then driving the price down as much as possible. Why tho? Why would it be in interest of a shareholder to not let shorters squeeze and possibly drive the price higher? Of course you could see a little profit taking but not in the range of 10% intraday. We have institutions playing the game with each other, and the fact that $GME have little or no media coverage seems fishy as well. Not to mention they got downgraded yesterday when the stock was up 70%.  **I'm still holding.**|2021-01-14 13:35:19

With 68 million shares out of a total 102 million shares being short on Dec 31, this is going to get **real expensive** for the institutional traders being caught with their pants down.|2021-01-14 14:16:07

Chewy is a fucking monster. I believe Ryan Cohen can turn GameStop into the CHWY of all Nerd Culture items. Gaming consoles, gaming accessories, funko pops, board games, comics, tabletop games, DND books. Integrating into the e-sports scene, getting high popularity streamers sponsored, partnering with Microsoft and muscling in on Twitch.   There is big room for growth imo.

j88vms|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|12|I think we should be buying calls along side our shares in this GME play. Here's why: Market makers gonna have to buy a lot of GME at the open to delta balance their positions.  For instance: I have 60 calls at $40. Yesterday it was delta .22. At the open it will be delta .45. This means the MM has to buy approximately 1,380 shares at the open. That's 52k worth of shares purchased because I bought $6k of calls yesterday.  Note: I've got 2k shares as well.  TL;DR buy shares \*AND\* buy OTM calls.  🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-01-14 08:14:44

j96orb|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|21|to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS 💎🙌|2021-01-14 12:35:06

j8u8sa|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|12|GREEN ENERGY:  >Mr. Biden will detail his plans, which he and his economic team have been honing for weeks, in an evening speech in Delaware. The efforts will cover the pandemic, the economy, health care, education, climate change and other domestic priorities, Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National Economic Council, said at the [Reuters Next conference](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-deese/bidens-economic-plan-to-focus-on-immediate-rescue-from-covid-19-crisis-adviser-idUSKBN29I2NM) on Wednesday. Top Democrats in Congress have said in recent days that they are preparing for the efforts to span two bills.  &#x200B;  >The proposals in the second tranche are likely to be larger than the first, and Democrats plan to pay for all or some of them [by raising taxes on corporations and the rich](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/politics/bernie-sanders-budget-committee.html). The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden’s team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated.

j9jfjg|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|10|Unless hedge funds have some kind of sweet deal with their brokerages (which I doubt), they have to pay $ to maintain their positions overnight. Assuming they're trading on leverage, which most of funds do, the commission is even higher. Question is: would you as a fund manager maintain your huge short position on a stock that is up your ass, while paying commission to your broker, for a 3-day weekend? Given the sentiment the funds have no choice but close their positions by tomorrow's close. Otherwise they'll suffer imputable loses come Tuesday. Or they'll try to call their MM's friends to downgrade $GME entirely - which is fucking possible given this market.  **My take:** Funds will try to close their positions tomorrow causing another rally. Be aware, they know how to control the bleeding and institutions are helping them as we can see by these "block" sell orders (fuck 'em btw.). I could see another 30% day tomorrow. This is not financial advise tho, make your own moves.|2021-01-14 14:11:53

COVID has spread so many times that it has evolved at its originating location - Biden sends out the 49th $2000 stimulus check to Americans as stay at home orders reach its 57th month. - An uncurable, unvaccinatable strain, dubbed the "45th for the 45th" has developed amongst the red hats as they now hold coughing parties to 'stick it to the libs'.  The red hat population has declined by 70%. - Palantir announces their 5th demo day after their first 4 ended in violent riots with vaguely audible chants of "To the moon" immediately following a 9% crash in their stock price. - WSBers en masse were reported to have used all $98,000 of their stimulus checks on PLTR $25Cs which all expired worthless every month. - PLTR begins 2024 at $13.69.|2021-01-14 10:14:47

j84ufj|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|5|ha  > Seasonal flu cases are at record lows in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "We haven't seen nearly the level of influenza that we have historically seen in years before," says Meg Meeker, M.D., a pediatrician and bestselling author of Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters. Cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in kids younger than 1, are also lower than usual.  https://www.parents.com/news/the-pandemic-is-leading-to-a-decrease-in-common-illnesses-among-kids-heres-what-pediatricians-say-we-can-learn-from-it/|2021-01-14 07:34:57

I think Cohen knows this too, which is why he's posting memes and trying to get degens behind him so that we'll be loyal to GME.

The very utterance of the Japanese language is enough to make me diamonds, and things as mundane as an exceptionally curvy line for pre to force its way through the fabric of my jeans. During the day I’m a normal looking guy, but the moment I get home I dump all my notebook paper on my bed, douse myself in paint, and throw myself on the fallen leaflets pretending to be a 2D boy. My mom leaves me dinner, but 3D food disgusts me, so instead I take pictures of the food, print them out, and eat the paper. “Itadeckymass” I grumble through tears as the rough laminated paper lacerates my esophagus. My waifu is a cardboard cutout of Megumin, but last week we broke up after I told her that cardboard is actually 3D. I’m heartsick, but I’m true to who I am.

I'm not saying you're stupid or don't do it. I'm saying, understand the level of risk here. I hope you get lucky, I really do.

I bought a single GME put (1/29 $16.5) at open, not to bet against this epic run, but to watch it and get a feel.  Since then, GME has gone up quite a bit further, but my put is up 40% (1 put @ .23, $23 now at .33, $32.50).  Why would my put increase that much while the stock is rocketing up?  Edit:  Since I believe in the GME train, I’m going likely just watch this put burn and just watch how the IV and theta modify the gain/losses.|2021-01-14 11:45:16

PLTR flashed up and then has had about 2 sideways months, meaning that the run-up was to a more realistic valuation.   And the barrage of downgrades from the likes of CITI are maneuvers.   It will moon. The whole point of this making the stock public was to let the employees sell shares and make bank in mid February. It will moon like GME.

Today I bought back in, BUT I am only allowing myself to buy 20 shares max.   For me, if some value/ profit was lost on those 20 shares, it would phase me, and thus I wouldn’t paper hand.   However, hypothetically speaking, if each share increased in value by $100, the profit I would make would suffice. ❤️|2021-01-14 11:48:01

j8vgz2|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|2|Thoughts on AMZN Feb 5 3300C ?  It's been flat for 3 months after strong earnings and seems to be consolidating.   I see near term catalysts as:  * Biden Admin being (relatively) friendly to big tech. Certainly compared to what Trump would have done. Might see a movement on inauguration * Earnings report Feb 4. Current price well below all analyst expectations * Biden pumping more stimmy quickly following inauguration should provide favorable headwinds before earnings * Many cities shutting down again (E.g. Toronto issued a "Stay at home" order starting today). This is continuing to happen globally.  I understand the political headwinds abroad / anti-trust probes / unionization. Admittedly, these could freeze the price in this range until resolved. Still, it seems like a reasonable bet. Thoughts?|2021-01-14 11:12:17

I bought a small amount early this morning (didn’t realize the IPO had hit) and wish I’d have picked up more. Still, up almost 18 dollars a share at the moment. While this is totally not scientific, just their presence and their business type made me pretty confident in their future. I assume they make money off the sales they loan for since they (from what I’ve seen) typically charge you zero interest for using them to roll your purchase.   Be careful and take my idiotic recommendation as a grain of salt, I’m no professional just an avid consumer. IPOs are always nuts for the first stretch it seems.|2021-01-14 11:27:44

But if we go up to $30 and there is only 20% short interest then we know most of them got out and covered already somehow. -    [**hooman\_or\_whatever**](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/)  &#x200B;  Does anyone know what is the current  short interest   ?|2021-01-14 12:06:25

MBS price levels: prices have leveled off in last 3 days after a week of declines. The new york federal reserve bank will be publishing their daily purchase schedule of MBS for next few weeks at 3 eastern. This will give an idea if the fed will be pulling back on these purchases soon.  Weekly jobless claim: 965,000 claims last week, highest since August. Market expectation was 795,000.

j9kafc|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|1|WFC: I bought to open a February $30C, and I sold to open a January 15th $35C. Never expected WFC to get anywhere near $35 by tomorrow, but here we are currently trading just under $35.  The $30C is currently worth $5.13, and the $35C is -$0.77  Normally, I would just wait until tomorrow and buy the $35C back right before close. There's a good chance it drops to virtually nothing tomorrow, either way it will lose a ton of extrinsic value between now and then.  Here's the problem - WFC releases earnings tomorrow morning before open, 3 scenarios:  * If WFC tanks I didn't waste money buying the $35C back but I'll lose much more on the $30C. Sure it might come back before Feb expiry, or I could roll it further out, but I'd rather have sold today and then buy back in. * If WFC shoots up, no big deal, I'll still buy the $35C back at close tomorrow and still gain the extrinsic value between today and tomorrow while the intrinsic value between the $30C and $35C cancel out. * If WFC stays flat, great, the $35C drops and the $30C stays steady - I gain.  So what would you do?  1. Buy to close the $35C, sell to close the $30C and exit the position 2. Hold both 3. Buy to close the $35C, hold the $30C  What's the consensus opinion. I've got 40 minutes - lol.|2021-01-14 14:18:24

WSB was a place to go to read about what people did that was stupider than you can Imagine - laugh your ass off - and make you forget your own dumb shit. Now, it just feels like the banks took over with constant shill and bots. I have to read every garbage post and strain for some semblance of anything resembling market news. Just emojis and random shit stocks. I couldn’t find a single post discussing CPI yesterday morning after the results. Cant even jump to r/investing as it feels the same! You know that boring buy this ETF -with .16 expense ratio. Now that sane subreddit encourages buying all this junk too. That’s what’s really scary...Yeah I missed the GME run and Good for everyone.

j91txh|kx3ja5|kx3ja5|0|what is happening with **DASH** stock is that at open peoples tummies start rumbling they remember an IPO that delivers food this is the most incredible, original, completely proprietary idea! They open their tastyworks app and see door dash mooning again, my my my what a revolution. They buy some calls, some FD's they even load up on shares. This company will change the world. They love the idea of seamless food delivery, they open their phone... order some wendys and then ensues the shittiest user experience of their life. A wendys $5 biggie bag costs them $9.87 + tip, the food arrives 60 minutes later, ice cold... you have to assume Rishi ate some fries on his way to your house. Finally you food is there, a beautiful contactless delivery, your cravings about to be satisfied and this fucker put your food right in front of your door so when you open it the dr. pepper floods your bag sauging up your **tendies**.  &#x200B;  ERNAGED you open your phone and buy every short you can get your hands on.. you see everyone else following suit DASH annihilates all of its gains on the day trading down after 12. Dash poppin up... slippin down every day after lunch.  &#x200B;  Thankyou for coming to my ted talk.|2021-01-14 11:58:41

Good news is that it sounds like free money is going to be printed for the coming months. I ain't getting rich but hopefully I'll make a few hundred bucks in the next few weeks. Who would have thought just reading comments on reddit could legit make you free money haha. Knowing my luck though I will put that $120 into something that actually fails.
