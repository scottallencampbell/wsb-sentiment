He buys twitter at way above market value, and drills it into the ground.  Guy doesn't care enough about his money, and if you're a Tesla shareholder, that sucks.

The workshop of the world isn't quite so cheap anymore and they're facing vicious competition from neighbors like Vietnam.  The other problem is their demographics are a nightmare, they're facing a population inversion like has never been seen where their peak working age demographic is going to be replaced by smaller and smaller generations.

x973dv|z0w55k|z0w55k|5|Against the Fed's current short-term target rate of between 3.75% and 4.00%, Daly said some researchers have found "the level of financial tightening in the economy is much higher than what the (federal) funds rate tells us." Compared to the current target rate, she added, "financial markets are acting like it is around 6%."  Given that markets have priced in a monetary policy setting that's well beyond what the Fed has imposed on the economy so far, Daly said "it will be important to remain conscious of this gap between the federal funds rate and the tightening in financial markets. Ignoring it raises the chances of tightening too much."  🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮|2022-11-21 12:36:48

The only difference I really see between them is that Chapek was more of a penny pincher, especially on the parks side, which seems like exactly the kind of guy you want during a recession.   Yes, the stock price started to fall when Igor left, but he left at the peak of the covid bubble and we’ve had a year long bear market since then. I don’t think Igor being there this past year would have made a difference. They’d still have a lackluster phase 5 at Marvel, a fledgling Disney+ because of mediocre shows, etc. If anything they have a writers problem, not a CEO one|2022-11-21 06:26:46
