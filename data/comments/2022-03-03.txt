I've been successfully shorting this on and off all year because the trade works and isn't crowded at all. They'll also probably guide down next Q with the coming recession  Bull case: this thing is like the basis for our entire nationalized pension/retirement system at this point. It is the ultimate "too big to fail," or even dip significantly. The Fed bought fucking apple bonds in the summer of 2020 like it was actual communism time. I also kinda feel like any severe uncertainty in the broader market could lead to a worldwide flight to safety in AAPL which has a better balance sheet than most governments.

You always wanna pick up some puts on a green candle, and by the time you go to buy them, they cost .20 more than the limit you entered 5 seconds ago.   Then shit keeps going down and you say "well, it's about to reverse, it would be dumb to enter a put now."  But it doesn't. Fucking. Stop.  Four attempts to enter later, you look at the first put you tried to buy shortly after open. It's now worth $3 more than it was 2 hours ago.   Better luck next time!|2022-03-03 10:05:27

z6vjb9|t5p2hk|t5p2hk|5|Literally the only way to make serious money from a small principal is a lopsided options play. High volatility markets like this are where fortunes are made by little guys leveraging volatility to their advantage. Tickers like ARKK and TSLA have 10-20% moves over the course of a week. Your time spent staring at tickers and buying the dip is better off learning some basics options math.  &#x200B;  EDIT: bet small, win big, take money off the table very week, pick a direction to load up on but hedge for the opposite just in case we gap up/down in the morning, if you can't meet the daytrader minimum that's your first target and don't expect to hit it in a day or a week but once you hit that you can start scalping volatility.|2022-03-03 09:12:19

z6mlch|t5p2hk|t5p2hk|6|So here's my thought for the day. You're all looking at the oil price and thinking 'wow oil moon, very' but in fact, oil is in the sharpest backwardation it's ever been in, which is incredibly bearish. Look at the futures prices for oil for the coming months. If you're trading for year end it's in the $80s currently.   https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/futures/CRUDE%20OIL%20-%20ELECTRONIC/contracts  And not just oil. Lots of commods are in backwardation.  Long story short. Anyone buying the shit out of oil companies should be ready for a faceripper downwards particularly if Russia announces nationalisation of Exxon, BP, Shell and Total's assets there.  Or when the (obvious) Iran deal that floods the market with oil by midsummer, shows up in the coming days. Then OPEC nations decide actually maybe they WILL dump oil on the market and buy political credit, before the Iranian oil shows up anyway.  ---  🧸 Bear Facts keeping it real since 2022 🧸|2022-03-03 08:08:14

They've already altered their military strategy to surrounding key cities and keeping everyone on edge with random air strikes. Sooner or later, I see them succeeding in the invasion.  The world has already thrown the book at Russia but we're going to be hurting too with commodity prices skyrocketing amid record inflation.

z73qvp|t5p2hk|t5p2hk|2|Hi there. So a few months ago I bought 7 shares worth 77,87 euro of BESI semiconductor industries. I thought I was smart and the shares would rise because of the chip shortage. BESI increased their revenue by 44% compared to last year, which is a new record for the company.        The thing is, the stock remains pretty volatile(imo) and struggles to reach the 80 euro mark, despite great forecasts and market situation. Why is this exactly?|2022-03-03 10:06:53

z66ab7|t5p2hk|t5p2hk|0|DAILY REMINDER THAT THERE IS NO BULL CASE RIGHT NOW.  Stay in cash gang bois!!!  Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping off a cliff. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. the s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite. Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.   AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.   Bull cases: WW3 might not happen. Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-03-03 05:36:54

z70dza|t5p2hk|t5p2hk|-1|🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸  You're all looking at the oil price and thinking 'wow oil moon, very' but in fact, oil is in the sharpest backwardation it's ever been in, which is incredibly bearish.  Look at the futures prices for oil for the coming months. If you're trading for year end it's in the $80s currently.  https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/futures/CRUDE%20OIL%20-%20ELECTRONIC/contracts  And not just oil. Lots of commods are in backwardation.  Anyone buying the shit out of oil companies should be ready for a faceripper downwards particularly if Russia announces nationalisation of Exxon, BP, Shell and Total's assets there.  Or when the (obvious) Iran deal that floods the market with oil by midsummer, shows up in the coming days. Then OPEC nations decide actually maybe they WILL dump oil on the market and buy political credit, before the Iranian oil shows up anyway.  ---  🧸 Bear Facts keeping it real since 2022 🧸|2022-03-03 09:44:47

Warrants exercise date is coming up in around 8 business days.  There is a big opportunity to make huge gains on these warrants.   You do not need to exercise them, you could simply Buy and Sell them just like regular stocks.   They are not currently available on robinhood.  I trade them on Fidelity.   Ps - High risk high reward.  But seeing the simple math, even if you dont exercise them, juat trading them short term will be good.   Do your own research, not financial advise|2022-03-03 14:43:12
