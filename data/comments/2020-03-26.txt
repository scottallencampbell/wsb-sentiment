ljs2bi|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|26|Repost from the cv sub.   SPY 150-170 by July.   *The problem with COVID-19 is that it‚Äôs attacking ciliary cells in the lungs. These are the cells that move mucous up into your larger airway so you can cough it out. Infected people slough off their cilia and so cannot cough out secretions. This is why there is a dry cough instead of a productive one. It‚Äôs one heck of a chest cold even if it doesn‚Äôt turn into a pneumonia and is one of the ‚Äòmild cases‚Äô. A big problem is that some people develop a cytokine storm. Cytokines over produce in an exaggerated immune response. Cytokines are what target our immune system to attack a virus. During a cytokine storm they target our healthy cells as well as virus. The lungs become raw like an open blister. It‚Äôs painful and unfortunately produces a lot of fluid. It happens extremely quickly and is an incredible challenge to manage medically. Coronavirus are extremely small too. They are just .125 microns. To put that into perspective, you could line up 70-80 Coronavirus end to end across one red blood cell. This is why we get mixed messages about whether it‚Äôs droplet or airborne. It is droplet. But it‚Äôs so incredibly small that it‚Äôs quite easy for it to float in air for a time. The good news is that it has a lipid shell. Just soap and water destroys it easily. Outside of a body, it‚Äôs easy to kill. However, Inside the body it‚Äôs currently impossible to destroy. This is why isolation is so important. If we can stop transmission it will die. It‚Äôs incredibly contagious so as long as it has a host it won‚Äôt die.*   This thing is airborne, puts until the boomer crisis.|2020-03-26 07:13:31

lku5kc|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|19|This pump is *hilarious*. Sitting on my puts happily. +30 4/17 SPY 220p from $6.  The S&P p/e is still right around 20, which is quite high historically speaking. We literally barely got back to 2016 levels at the height of the sell-off. A good deal of the gains from 2016 to 2019 were stock buy-backs, corporate tax cuts, and the fed lowering rates in a raging bull-market. We put on over 50% in the three years from 2016-2019...  Do you think the S&P is fairly priced at a p/e of 20 during a worldwide pandemic? I don't. And let's not forget - that p/e is actually high at the moment as corporate earnings are surely going to be hit.  Honestly. SPY 250 is a fair price without the pandemic. I absolutely think we should see SPY 150 before this is out (whether or not we will is a different story, but we need a reset...). We need to flush out the damn bubble.

In a rare TV interview, Powell told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show that the Fed will ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù use its emergency lending authority to keep credit flowing through the economy and maintain 0-percent interest rates to help the U.S. rebound when the pandemic subsides.  ‚ÄúWhen it comes to this lending, we're not going to run out of ammunition. That doesn't happen,‚Äù Powell said.  Powell added that while the most direct relief for U.S. households and businesses will come from a $2-trillion stimulus bill passed by the Senate early Thursday, ‚Äúthe Federal Reserve is working hard to support you now and our policies will be very important when the recovery does come to make that recovery as strong as possible.‚Äù  Powell's comments come hours after the Senate approved a massive economic rescue package early Thursday morning after weeks of bipartisan negotiations and several last-minute threats.  The bill includes provisions for direct payments to Americans making less than $100,000 each, forgivable loans for small businesses intended to prevent layoffs and bankruptcies, aid for industries devastated by the outbreak, and more than $400 billion to backstop Fed lending facilities opened over the past month to stabilize financial markets.  The Fed since March 3 has slashed its baseline interest rate range to 0 to 0.25 percent, begun purchasing more than $700 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and established programs where financial firms can receive loans in exchange for corporate bonds, commercial debt, and short-term municipal bonds.)

No. But you significantly reduce the amount of risk you're incurring since it's almost guaranteed to go up or down in large moves.

ll5b3g|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|34|#Okay all you tards gotta listen up.  I posted this yesterday and will keep posting until yall listen!  First, There is no good in being perma bears or bulls that is so fucking stupid the only gang that you want to join is **PRINTING GANG**  Second, This is what I made today [+$7,306.69](https://i.imgur.com/V7LQr1z.jpg), YES I MADE MONEY ON PUTS TODAY and This year so far [+$325,244.60](https://i.imgur.com/YLrYlfw.jpg) which on average I made 3.37% per trade so **DON'T GET FUCKING GREEDY** and **TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING PROFIT**.  Third, I have day traded options for about 14 years since I was 22. Right now the market is **ONCE IN A LIFETIME** opportunity. Like my man EMINEM once said *"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity, To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo"* so don't let it fucking slip.  **DO**   - Get in and get out don't be fucking greedy.  - Have an entry and exit price in mind before you open the fucking trade. So learn how to cut losses and take the profit.  - Learn your greeks if you don't know what it is just fucking BING IT.  - Keep in your mind that if you trading options without any underlying then you are **GAMBLING**. This is not investing and stop calling your bankroll "portfolio".  **DON'T**   - DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT be **H**orrified **O**f **M**issing **O**ut. Just remember that it is better making no money than losing money so assess the market before make a fucking trade.  - Don't fucking all in, this is not a world poker series. There is no such a thing as a sure trade.  - If you win on one trade. It is already your money. Don't use your tard brain and think that now you are gambling with a house money.  - Stop using fucking robinhood and use any real broker. I use Charlie's most of my trading friend use IBKR  - Don't be fucking poor go find $25,000 and day trade if you don't have $25,000 then go live your live until you have it.  Good fucking luck and Happy Gambling  ps. make all the $60k joke I lost last year all you want but for all 14 years I only have 3 negative years which are the first two and last year.|2020-03-26 15:18:15

lkhzsm|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|11|You know what, I'm making the bull argument for bears to understand  The key to the face ripping rally is two things, low volume and portfolio management at end of quarter  Firstly, low volume occuring in a bear market can signal a rally, as while small investors are either to hesitant or unwilling to enter the market, MM have much more power into manipulating a stocks value throughout the day. Combine this with the FED's efforts and you have an unconquerable beast that will see the market go green  As for portfolio management, end of quarter is very soon, and the average 401k is adjusting their portfolios,  increasing the demand for stocks and bonds, whether it be a 60/40 or whatever  As a dumb bitch who bought a few puts last week and bought some more Monday and Tuesday, this rally realistically won't end at least until the end of the quarter, which is March 31st  TL;DR: diamond hands, but stay strong  P.S: guy who offered 1k for someone to explain rally, give me my money so I can average down please|2020-03-26 11:48:07

llpzwe|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|3|Sorry to break it to you bulls, this isn't bottom.  [Feb 17 SPY Chart - Stimulus signed into law](https://i.imgur.com/A3ivgxm.jpg)  We still have a bit more red ahead of us, perhaps a lot. Yeah I get it this is  different. You can't compare past performance to current. Except, this is a lot worse of a scenario. In 2009 people could still go to work! I know crazy right? Unemployment has risen to about 5.5% already with much higher expected. The peak unemployment in 2009 was 10%. Hospitals weren't at capacity in 2009. Once that happens(which is garunteed if Daddy Pump tells us all go back out and about in a few weeks) a lot of people will die. If not from the virus, from not being able to get the medical care they need in the case of literally any other life threatening medical situation. The $1200 will last most people what, a few weeks? Then what? I highly doubt this will be over in a few weeks. People will still be unemployed. Companies get tax breaks but they don't have workers to produce?

This is nearly 5x (!) the prior record of 671K new jobless claims from 1982, and redefines the scale for jobless claims. 5.

That monthly close is on EOD Tuesday.  I'm betting on us rallying to near that level between today and tomorrow and then a major battle ensuing. If you're bearish, 265 is the region to throw the kitchen sink at it. If you're bullish, you should have started playing at 237. Don't go long on this shit unless it closes above 265 on Friday.

lkrlsn|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|11|Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think  Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You  work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are  made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know  that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows  the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born.  Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was  valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population  growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how  many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take  the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced  in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original  thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the  omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all  and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the  universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the  universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL  has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already  been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.|2020-03-26 13:12:57

Primary trend line is at 2725 today and 2695 tomorrow.  I would be really hesitant to call any sort of recovery till we break that trend. I'm holding put debit spreads till we do|2020-03-26 09:35:02

Eventually we will, so everyone is afraid they will miss the chance of a lifetime. When we got a bounce timed as news of the stimulus was everywhere, idiots started to believe the bottom was truly in, setting off a chain reaction of panic buying. When the bill is passed and we don't keep rocketing upwards, things will likely plunge. The bill was really only a catalyst for idiots ignoring reality and FOMOing - reality will settle back in soon.

I am sure that the spread of this infectious disease is rapidly underway without knowing it. Today, Tokyo Governor Ms. Koike requested the citizens to spend their weekend with self-restrain for the first time. Tokyo recorded the highest number of infection increase. I don't deny there is a huge amount of possibility that Tokyo could be "lock down" like other major cities in other countries. My family and I are now OK. All the restaurants, shops and others are open as usual at this moment. However, I am trying to minimize my exposures to these.  tl:dr; Japan is not shutting down as much as we think they are and the public is concerned about reinfection.|2020-03-26 15:19:39

ljz4u5|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|2| > Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday said the historic jump in jobless claims was not a piece of economic data to focus on because it was for a period before government relief was assured. "To be honest with you, I just think these numbers right now are not relevant, whether they are bigger or smaller in the short-term," Mnuchin said, in an interview on CNBC (https://www.cnbc.com/). With the Senate coronavirus relief bill now so close to passage in the House, he hopes that firms start to rehire these workers, he said. As late as last week businesses didn't have another choice except let workers go because they didn't have cash and didn't know that protections would be forthcoming, Mnuchin said.|2020-03-26 08:45:56

ll0yec|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|2|Okay bears, I get there are gonna be a ton of cases and deaths going forward but the market does not react, they generally price in this stuff months in advance. They will follow what the scientists say will be peak infection rates, deaths, etc. That will be priced in unfortunately. You will still get retailers panicking with the headlines stating some milestone of cases, overcrowding, etc. The market does predict and price in stuff well before it happens so to see circuit breakers, you need surprises. Big surprises. It'll definitely drop again but seeing people with 200ps and the such, that's a bit extreme unless NYC devolves into looting and rioting  Nobody truly knows though so don't listen to me.

ll7hsv|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|2|### This has nothing to do with stocks but someone tell me why this is necessary?   ### Chief executives could still receive millions in compensation.  Lawmakers put some restrictions on the compensation of executives whose companies receive government assistance [under the bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/coronavirus-senate-deal.html), in an effort to address one of the criticisms about bailouts of banks and other companies during the 2008 financial crisis. But the limits will not do away with multimillion-dollar paydays for corporate bosses.  * Executives who made more than $3 million in 2019 could be awarded $3 million, plus half of any sum in excess of $3 million. As a result, a chief executive who earned $20 million in 2019 would be allowed compensation of $11.5 million, or $3 million plus half of $17 million per year. * Companies receiving assistance will not be allowed to increase the compensation of executives who earned $425,000 to $3 million in 2019 until a year after government support ends.|2020-03-26 15:37:28

I‚Äôm not saying I went through the Coronavirus but I will say for the past 2 weeks I‚Äôve been miserable with all symptoms except shortness of breath and a fever.  Really no where for me to get tested so I‚Äôve been self quarantined.  And have been to SeaWorld where tons of tourists fly into blah blah.    Anyways... the only thing that gave me ANY relief is Tylenol.  That‚Äôs it.  NOTHING ELSE.  The first week i didn‚Äôt know about ibuprofen making symptoms worse and that‚Äôs all i had.  Made things much worse.  Got my hands on some Tylenol finally 2 days ago and it‚Äôs night and day.  My lymph nodes aren‚Äôt sore as fuck anymore and my 2 week sore throat is manageable as well as my cough has cleared.    BUY JOHNSONS AND JOHNSON FOR THE LONG!!!!|2020-03-26 07:06:39

lkoinz|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|5|What bear did they build this beartrap to catch, Ursa Majoris? Meteoric fall, rocket ship rise, but there is no escaping this gravity.  From what I have read (its fucking massive and they adding more to it), I would say that the stimulus is only at 50% of what is needed... 25% of US employment is service industry, which is being hit hardest. How many people max potentially unemployed is 25%? What socioeconomic effects does approaching 25% unemployment have? Even if we buckle down and force a full month of total quarantine to kill this virus off completely and be able to open back up, there are still spiraling effects. The longer it goes the worse it is.   How many companies will take the loans to avoid laying people off when they have no income, rather than lay them off and rehire them later, possibly for less pay, with less overhead and risk? How many small businesses will do the math and still just shut down forever?  I expect the stock market to remain volatile for ~ 60 days, then volatility will drop and rise again for quarterly reporting unless we somehow fuck everything up beyond all repair. I'm not even going to guess how long before we start to moon again yet. I can't afford options that far out.|2020-03-26 12:45:41

lkh38z|fp9nxr|fp9nxr|-1|For the market to go down we‚Äôd need to get news that any of the following are true   - more than 1M Americans will die in next 3 months - the near 100% quarantine/shutdown will continue at near 100% for more than 12 weeks - unemployment will be at more than 30% and will be for a sustained period of time  Any less is bad news we‚Äôve already heard predicted.  Not only have we already heard it but every day the likelihood of any of the above being true gets lower and lower and lower  Thus the market goes up  Bears are too high on doomberg news to get this  At this point looks like  - less than 100k Americans will die - well sequentially open the economy up starting in 3-4 weeks - unemployment won‚Äôt get anywhere near 20-30%|2020-03-26 11:40:04
