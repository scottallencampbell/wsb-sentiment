84mwc6|j7agfu|j7agfu|10|Forty thousand years ago, the Altiplano (high plateau) of Bolivia was covered by a vast lake, Lake Minchin. When the lake dried up, it left behind two large salt deserts. Salar de Uyuni, the larger of the two, contains an astounding 10 billion tons of salt and covers over 4,000 square miles. That makes it the largest salt flat in the world, more than 20 times bigger than America‚Äôs largest, in Death Valley.  In all of Salar de Uyuni, an area almost as large as the state of Connecticut, there‚Äôs no more than a meter‚Äôs variation in altitude. That‚Äôs so flat that the area is routinely used by satellites to calibrate their instruments. Because the desert is so high, so dry, and reflects so much light, it‚Äôs five times better for satellite calibration than even the surface of the ocean. The ‚Äúmountains‚Äù and ‚Äúvalleys‚Äù of the Salar may be only a few millimeters in height.  Salar de Uyuni is the flattest place on earth.  Today, SPY is flatter.|2020-10-08 12:35:47

I have observed a pattern (except July) where we have a sizable correction within 10 days of the monthly opex (options expiry).      Check the opex for the following months and the movement prior to that date (usually between 10-3 days prior):      **May: Opex 5/15, pullback 5/11**   **June: Opex 6/19, pullback 6/10**   **July: Opex 7/17, pullback (negligible) 7/10**   **August: Opex 8/21, pullback 8/6**   **September: Opex 9/18, pullback (after crash) 9/15**      *I won't be caught with my pants down this time.*|2020-10-08 12:43:45

Also the new CPUs will be compatible with older mobos so easy upgrade for everyone (remember Intel changing socket every fuckin 2 Gens ?).

No way for my leaps to recover. Also, the new iPhones suck. Leaks show that they don't even have 120Hz display. What's the point of buying one? There's no improvement to last generation.

83t3is|j7agfu|j7agfu|-7|I need your help. So all of the stocks I own were doing great in the premarket. Everyone besides SQQQ, which went down 50 cents and I have 10 shares of. However, I had to have been making like 30 dollars overnight. Instead robinhood says my account value went from $11,410 to $11,340. If it only tracks the value of your stocks, HOW did it say I lost money when all of my stocks went up. Tesla alone made me 10 dollars. https://imgur.com/gallery/rUQ3fl9|2020-10-08 08:17:37
