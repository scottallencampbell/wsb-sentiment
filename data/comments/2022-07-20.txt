gy3qiy|w3iicm|w3iicm|6|Just fyi, over the past six months, the most common time for TSLA, MSTR, SPY and others to reverse the direction of the day is 2:30 (that is, I‚Äôd you‚Äôre up at 2:30, you move down from 2:30 to 4 about 60% of the time).  The most common time to actually switch overall direction for the day is 3. That is, if you were up for the day at 3, you have about a 5% chance to end up down for the day  Largest reversal gap median is from 1:30 (that is, lowest value after 1:30 if you were up at 1:30 is the largest gap from price at 1:30).  75% of the time, the reversal gap will be >$14. From 1:30, 75% of the time it will be > $18 for TSLA    Do with this what you will.|2022-07-20 13:07:51

gxelb6|w3iicm|w3iicm|5|Yield curve has stayed sharply inverted over the past week around 0.22 spread between the 2 year and 10 year.  Looking back historically, recessions usually result in an inversion blowout to 0.50 spread which I tend to think is the level at which markets would probably price in a recession here.  I'm skeptical we've bottomed, but I would be riding this current up-trend up, don't fight markets pricing in relative Fed easing next year until it becomes clearer that the economy is a mess.  10 year should move down if/when economic data get worse while 2 year stays up over 3.|2022-07-20 10:26:36

gyepa1|w3iicm|w3iicm|0|People DM me a lot and ask how to get a flair. They've actually simplified the process since COVID started so it's a lot more straightforward now.  1. Pick a flair! Make it memorable and as unique as possible.  2. Go through the list of mods and go over their posting history. Find one who really resonates with you.  3. Download the flair application from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Make sure you print it out in triplicate.  4. Fill out all three copies of the application with a number 2 pencil.   5. Make sure the notary uses a blue pen ONLY (they will send your application back if it's any color besides blue).  6. On page 4 of the application, where it asks for the type of sacrifice you're willing to make, I usually suggest people just say "virgin" or "person who has never had the sex". Note: THIS CANNOT BE YOU, IT MUST BE A VIRGIN YOU KNOW AND CAN SACRIFICE TO BAPHOMET  7. On page 27 of the application, where it asks your 1st grade math teacher's blood type, if it's "O" you should just give up. They don't accept that anymore.  8. On page 69 of the application, the answer to all 248 questions is "Nice". I agree it's not funny but I didn't write the fucking thing.  9. On page 133 of the application, they want your High School's mascot picture. That doesn't mean a picture of a tiger if the mascot was a tiger, they want the actual mascot picture. Download it from the website or something.  10. Finally, on page 256 of the application, make sure the penis or vagina picture you submit is yours. It will be matched against the FBI database.  I hope this helps!|2022-07-20 14:23:01
