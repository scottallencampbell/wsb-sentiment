Once reality hits, we're going back down.

fzxbax|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|7|Fucking FED wankers have no clue what they are doing re: inflation and that's the truth.    "I don't think it's time to taper. I don't think it's time to raise rates. Our policy is well-positioned to manage a range of plausible outcomes."    Jerome Powell October 22, 2021.    September 2021 inflation rate: 5.39%     "These higher prices have real effects on people's well-being and it takes a toll on everyone. If you're at the lower end of the income spectrum it's very hard because you are spending most of your money on necessities, but it's punishing for everyone... We can't blame the framework. It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation and then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was."    Jerome Powell March 16th, 2022.    February 2022 inflation rate: 7.87%   "We now understand better how little we understand about inflation. This was unpredicted... We fully appreciate the pain people are going through."    Jerome Powell June 29th, 2022.    May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%|2022-07-13 09:47:21

SO ‚Äî what I‚Äôm realizing is The stock already shook out the ‚Äòlogical‚Äô bulls, it already shook out the nervous ‚ÄòI‚Äôll buy lower‚Äô bulls, already shook out and drove crazy the ‚ÄòI love the company but can‚Äôt take the stock‚Äô bulls.   The only ones left are the regards. Not because they‚Äôre regarded by choice, not because ALL people believe the nonsense ‚Äî no they‚Äôre the onlys ones left ‚Äî because that‚Äôs what it took to hold this long through everything.

fzjrlg|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|18|Usually I just shitpost but I want to say something serious:  Everyone who thinks this market is going to bounce back and calls are gonna print belong in an insane asylum. I know everybody thinks that you have to inverse the market or be a contrarian to make money, but sometimes the trend is the trend for a reason. The economy seriously is going to start hurting soon and Jerome has told us he doesn't care about the stock market anymore. There's honestly no reason to be bullish right now and that's ok. Bear markets can last years. I can't predict the future but I can say that you are taking on unnecessary risk by buying calls.  This game is a game of probability and making bets with safe risk tolerance. If you are buying in the this market, it should only be for a 3-5 year hold of shares. I see no reason to gamble on calls, unless they are multi year LEAPS.  I could be wrong and SPY could hit ATH by EOY, but if that happens, I would be stunned. Remember, the reality of markets is created by the perception of the markets. And perception changes based on reality. This means that markets don't move based on some fundamental truth - they move based on what we expect them to do and only reverse when the herd psychology becomes more and more different over time.|2022-07-13 08:09:47

g04iw4|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|13|A lot of the younger people on here have no idea just how truly fucked they are and it's gonna start hitting more and moreof them over the next few years.   I remember being stoked that I started a two year paramedic school program in the fall of 2008, right after the crash. We all joked that we picked the best time to start, since surely the economy would be picking up by the time we graduated.  Fast forward a few years and hiring was at all time lows. Worst time in the history of the industry. And that was for emergency fucking medicine. People died because firehouses shut down and the number of active medics was way down.   I went back in to renew some certifications associated with my paramedic license in 2012 that were expiring, rather depressed to be paying more to keep up something which had made me unemployable while I lived with my fucking parents. Saw one of my favorite instructors. Asked him over drinks later what happened to the medic program his school had been planning to start. He laughed morosely and said, "Well, we decided it would be best not to train people how to be unemployed" before realizing that he was talking to someone who was working and paying to keep up his "unemployment license".  Recessions destroy lives and livelihoods. They fucking suck. And it's always the stupid and greedy leadership who cause them who do just fine while the rest of us get force fed their shit.   Fuck Allen Greenspan, fuck Ben Bernanke, and fuck Jerome Powell. You guys all know Bernanke, Fed chair during the 2008 financial crisis and great recession, works for Citadel now?

fzh7el|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|3|No, the dollar going up in value isn‚Äôt a bad thing. It‚Äôs a good thing. It says two things: first, this is a globalized economy so people expect America to deal with it better than others and second, that the fed is going to significantly tighten the money supply while other countries continue pumping into this. An appreciating currency can literally only be a good thing for this set of circumstances.  It also helps alleviate energy pressures by making imports cheaper.|2022-07-13 07:49:14

fzl6h7|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|3|Oil and commodities have gone down in last month. Chances are Fed will think about raising the rates by a 100 basis point as there will be no FOMC in August. This will allow them 2 months to see how the Fund Rate changes are impacting the wider markets. In the mean time, Biden's visit to the Kingdom is of critical importance. If America can appease them then oil output might increase. From inflation perspective, there is a glimmer of hope.  Not so much on earnings side though. Delta earnings are an early warning. If a sector with red hot demand can't keep up with inflationary pressured then I don't have much hope from others.

g0mq3v|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|2|Can someone explain this price action to me? Both headline and core inflation were down more than expected (it seemed like the market was pricing in headline to be higher but core to be at expected or lower), but somehow equities are up and the dollar is down. I'm very confused here. You could make the argument that this was all priced in, but that shouldn't warrant this much of an uptick. For example, even EURUSD is up, which makes no sense to me because of how weak the Euro has been lately and the fact that there's no news showing that the ECB will hike. Am I missing something or some piece of news? The only thing I can think of is that this CPI print increases recession fears, but the recent strong NFP print should alleviate that somewhat. Basically: how are stocks up and the dollar down on a higher core and headline CPI?|2022-07-13 12:31:24

fzslaz|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|2|I think the reason the market isn‚Äôt collapsing today is because while CPI was disgusting, investors are of the mindset that this is the peak of inflation. I know we have all heard that before, but think about last month. Gas prices went absolutely bonkers reaching their peak. We also got a PCE reading that came in at a reasonable (in our current economic climate) 6.3. Investors have every reason to believe this is the top of inflation and the drop yesterday afternoon and this morning coming into an earnings season that could at least be better than the last, seems like a buying opportunity to me. Will be holding my calls :)|2022-07-13 09:15:28

fzzekf|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|2|Whenever I see a female drinking something like water or coffee it makes me so unimaginably horny. I can't help but fantasize about how the liquid will travel through her body, be filtered by her kidneys, and transform into hot piss. That very same glass of water she's holding in front if me will soon become hot golden frothy nectar, expelled straight from her vagina. Sometimes I drive past a Starbucks and aggresively masturbate as I watch girls sip on their coffee. That dark caffeinated brew just waiting to be turned into her sweet urine gives me earth shattering orgasms. I often envy liquids for this very reason. It's gotten to the point where the sheer sight of a faucet is enough to cause an erection, knowing that it carries the piss fuel for females. My mind instantaneously imagines a girl with a full colon of pee running to the toilet in desperation, sitting down, and letting a geyser of hot fragrant, golden nectar erupt out of her uterus, The piss of a female is special. It is pure. Sweet. Precious. Being able to watch girls consume beverages is such a privilege, which is why I thank God everyday for giving me this blessing.|2022-07-13 10:01:05

g0jv4h|vxzi9z|vxzi9z|-2|OSAKA -- Panasonic Holdings will invest several billion dollars in a second U.S. electric vehicle battery factory in Kansas to supply a new high-capacity battery for Tesla, Nikkei has learned.  The decision follows Tesla's April opening of a second American EV factory in Texas to meet brisk demand.  Panasonic's move comes as competitors from China, South Korea and Europe ramp up investment in additional production.  The Japanese company picked the site of the new facility based on factors including its proximity to Texas and favorable tax treatment. Oklahoma had also been considered as a candidate location.  Panasonic aims to triple or quadruple EV battery production capacity by fiscal 2028 from the current level of roughly 50 gigawatt-hours per year.  Panasonic plans to make its new high-capacity 4680 battery at the U.S. factory. (Photo by Shoya Okinaga) It plans to install two production lines at a battery component factory in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, in fiscal 2023 and begin manufacturing its new high-capacity model, the 4680. That investment is expected to total roughly 80 billion yen ($580 million).  Panasonic had said it would determine whether to build new manufacturing facilities after seeing how production at the Wakayama plant fared in terms of profitability.  ADVERTISING  Increasing production demands from Tesla were likely a factor in the decision for a new U.S. plant, along with Panasonic's progress on the new technology. Prototypes started to ship in May.  Panasonic's first U.S. plant in Nevada, the Gigafactory 1, is jointly operated with Tesla. The Japanese company invested roughly 200 billion yen in that facility, which only began turning a profit in the year ended March 2021 as high failure rates kept mass production from getting off the ground.  Tesla's sales have been rising steadily, with annual vehicle deliveries reaching about 936,000 last year. Beyond its supply from Panasonic, the automaker plans to meet its growing appetite for batteries with in-house production of 4680s, along with procurement from outside sources.  Competition is intensifying in the electric vehicle battery market. South Korea's LG Energy Solution and General Motors announced this year plans to spend $2.6 billion on a new battery plant in Michigan.|2022-07-13 12:13:01
