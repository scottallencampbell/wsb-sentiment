He had such confidence, I can see how you might have gotten swayed in to believing him if you didn’t really know what you were doing. He kept talking about “research” and shit which I’m pretty sure was literally just looking at OI and being aware of the upcoming infrastructure bill.  It’s a shame he’s gonna get banned from that ban bet. Would love to see what he has to say when his “research” doesn’t pan out. How could Pelosi let that happen to her calls, bro?!

gch2db|q6iqma|q6iqma|23|Something I've noticed as someone who calls out people's shit a lot:  In other subreddits, if I type a comment that kinda calls out the reader's bullshit but mostly the comment is just funny, then it gets upvotes because people refuse to admit it's calling out their bullshit and they just read it like it's talking about everyone else, not them. But when you really call out their bullshit, like aggressively, like "yeah YOU with the yellow shirt I'm talking to you" so they can't just pretend it's not directed at them anymore, they downvote you to shit.  This sub is more consistent. Unless you use the art of subtlety to the fullest degree, you'll just get downvoted to shit on any comment that calls the reader out on their bullshit, no matter how benign or humorous of a post it is.  This is because when your money relies on you not being wrong about shit, you can't just go through life believing whatever delusion is most convenient for your feefees all the time, so it gets harder to just pretend what you're reading is about everyone else and doesn't apply to you.There are actually a lot of differences between wsb and the rest of reddit that can be explained by this same fundamental difference in capacity for delusion connected to the psychological dynamics of gambling.   Anyway, what I'm saying is, SPY 420 is a meme you fuckin retard bears|2021-10-12 07:22:50

gdpjfg|q6iqma|q6iqma|3|Turned spy loss into spy gain by re buying. Puts. 434/435. Oct 13/15. Got to 30-40 % and about 20% -30% on 80k position on each.    434 bought 1.40 and sold just under 2, around 1.85-1.97 mostly the 1.97.    435 bought 2.65, 2.9, sold 3.4.    Cleared about 46k. Good after losing this morning on that dive. Lost 14k there. 436 calls 433 puts. Just bad timing. Glad I went back in.    FB swinging share trades around 300-900 shares in batches between the SPY calls/puts, and at 318-322.|2021-10-12 12:51:34

gcvyzp|q6iqma|q6iqma|7|Waiting for a good entry point is one of the hardest things about options trading for me. I can be so impatient and the windows are so narrow.   Just now I’m looking at the 10/20 433p. I see SPY has spiked upwards so I go to open the trade while it’s at 3.78 per contract. By the time I get to the “place order” screen it’s at 4.00, so I tell myself I’m gonna wait a minute for it to get lower again. But then it goes to 4.31. Fuck! So I sit for a minute and wait and it seems like it’s not going down much lower than 4.10 or so. I buy a couple at 4.13. *Seconds* after I buy they’re at 3.95 per.   This neuralink shit needs to hurry up and get here, if I could have just gone “BUY” in my head the moment I saw SPY spike up I’d already be shrek dick green on these puts|2021-10-12 09:27:34

gdnpdv|q6iqma|q6iqma|6|so here is the deal with sofi, and I told you assholes to go full hog last week. They are getting the bank charter. I think it will be Nov 1. They have a motherfucking moat like no one else bc unlike SaaS, BaaS takes the Treasury and FDIC to approve you which takes time. SaaS was different you could just say ur a software company and trust them on their word that they would make money. And there was a lot more competition in that space. Sofi is way ahead of everyone in this space. The Boomer banks kind of suck at it so they aren't competition. There you go.

At worst there will be some service disruption and pretty night sky.  Buy the T and VZ dip.|2021-10-12 13:49:56
