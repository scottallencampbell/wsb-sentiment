fzkuc1|ew3qro|ew3qro|12|This is such a bear trap it's making me laugh. I'm laughing so hard my stomach muscles are starting to hurt. My organs are pressing each other so hard that my anus started releasing small pieces of poop. As the laughter continues , there's no more poop to release so small blood clouts are coming out of my ass.   I'm starting to worry but the laughing is impossible to stop. It's so intense I started crying blood from my eyes.   ...  After 10 hours the joyful laughter is starting to slowly sound like a plea for help. The sound of insanity that can be heard from my room is starting to worry my neighbours. They knock on the door.  I can't move. Im spazzing out on the floor waiting for the market to open. They're calling the cops.  ...  Help me   also short TSLA|2020-01-30 05:33:41

I was incredibly confused as to why my refund went UP after I imported TD Ameritrade. Turns out I had a net loss on my equity options trades but gains on my $SPX & /ES trades. It didn't report the 1256 contracts and only looked at the equity options trades. I had to type the other two in by hand. The $SPX trades were on the 1099 but the /ES trades were in a separate "supplement" 1099 I got later.

The vaccination rate for the flu is only 40%, and scientists say that if 80% of the population all got flu shots, the flu could be eradicated in just a few years.  But assuming people are too scared of needles. If we quarantined everyone in the world... like just stay home and don't go to work for one entire flu season, and no interaction with humans outside of your household unless you're wearing protective gear...  Would that permanently kill the flu virus? Because if we can eradicate the flu forever, just by shutting down the entire economy for 6 months, I think we should do it. For future generations.|2020-01-30 12:59:32

R. H. Hilton has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a golden age of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. A century later, as population growth resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.

g0yrxc|ew3qro|ew3qro|2|I'm trying to understand IV after getting ruined by the crush this morning on some OTM Tesla calls.  This is how I understand IV. An option with an IV of 100% for a stock trading at $10 means that the stock is expected to have a 68% chance of being anywhere between $0 and $20 over the next year? If IV was 50% it would be anywhere between $5 and $15. Correct?  So is it a dumb idea to buy options with an IV over 100%? I have some AIMT calls and it's saying the IV is 130%. Is this a dumb play and should I get out now? Is holding an option with high IV through an announcement (earnings, news, events, etc.) a bad idea?|2020-01-30 14:54:31

It looks like Asia futures put in a temporary floor for a dead cat bounce too (similar to Tuesday), which wouldn't be surprising after the HSI dropped 1500 in 2 days (10% from their last session before the holidays). Still bearish on China over the weekend because I think that's when we'll get flooded with headlines but these bear markets are also accompanied by huge swings to the upside that'll give you whiplash and the premiums are so expensive right now.

I have performed numerous predictive studies of complex human systems and consistently been extremely accurate in my understanding of long term macro outcomes. I've then used that to leverage human decision making toward improved outcomes. The primary difference between me and my degreed collegues is that I am concerned about the forest and seldom if ever become immersed in and caught in the details of the trees while fulling understanding the complex interactions of the trees as they make up the forest. I have had superiors run anova analyses on my projections because they were concerned about trusting them. This was in relation to multi-year projects and they came away no longer questioning my predictions once I fully explained my approach. I can be wrong on short term projections, but long term you're all fucked.|2020-01-30 08:07:30

g02339|ew3qro|ew3qro|1|Live from the WHO meeting:  "Oh, by the way, I am an epidemiologist with 30 plus years of experience. I have performed numerous predictive studies of complex human systems and consistently been extremely accurate in my understanding of long term macro outcomes. I've then used that to leverage human decision making toward improved outcomes. The primary difference between me and my degreed collegues is that I am concerned about the forest and seldom if ever become immersed in and caught in the details of the trees while fulling understanding the complex interactions of the trees as they make up the forest. I have had superiors run anova analyses on my projections because they were concerned about trusting them. This was in relation to multi-year projects and they came away no longer questioning my predictions once I fully explained my approach. I can be wrong on short term projections, but long term you're all fucked."|2020-01-30 09:34:59
