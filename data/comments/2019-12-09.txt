aaguii|e88kuy|e88kuy|7|>Neil Campling, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Mirabaud Securities, said the move by the Chinese government aims to protect against an escalation of tensions with the U.S.  >“That is something that China is looking at to make sure government operations are not affected by escalating tensions with the U.S.,” Campling told CNBC.  In other words ,China doesn't want to not get access to much needed updates, upgrades, etc because of Trumps bullshit. Now they're going to move to linux and their own godson line of CPUs to protect themselves. Farmers will sell some soy but tech is gonna take a beating - forever. China will be closed to them in a lot of government offices. Then a halo effect will work its way down to consumers who will simply buy the domestic stuff out of loyalty and patriotism.

a9yz8e|e88kuy|e88kuy|18|Today I attempted to insert a whole cantaloupe melon into my anus because the local shops had run out of apricots (I buy a lot). Using about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to shit it back out. This is where things got confusing because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots. Further experimentation will be required of course (once my rectum has recovered) but if this turns out to be true then I may be able to solve world hunger.|2019-12-09 07:14:09

Phase 3 data was leading into a top-line beat on expected. Possible break out to 65+ after this data?

aagf26|e88kuy|e88kuy|0|i bought 100 shares of CGC this morning - if i sell a covered call FD, the worst thing that could happen is i miss out on gains if it skyrockets, right?  i figured if my avg cost for the CGC shares was $20.40, then i could also sell a $22 FD covered call and even if it skyrockets past $22 i’d still make profit on the $1.60/share difference  am i retarded?|2019-12-09 10:21:02

aak8kk|e88kuy|e88kuy|0|So I'm making an app that plays youtube workout playlists with different work out genres like indoor cycling playlist, outdoor cycling playlist, workout playlist, and even some movies to watch while excersing. The app will be completely free. The app will be called peloshort. It will be like Netflix for exercise but completely free. I will show people how to attach a phone or tablet to their stationary bike or other work out equipment, and I will show how happy people are they didn't have to spend 3000$ for it. My revenue will come from peloton put investments.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wPeleshort_9950960|2019-12-09 10:45:12
