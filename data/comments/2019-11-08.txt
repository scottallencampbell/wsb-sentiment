6xb3gu|dtdwpg|dtdwpg|17|**Magical Crayons TA.**  It's the year the machines took over SPY. Throughout the day I told you all of the supports and the price points we'd probably hit. We hit them. I guessed we'd stay in the wedge. We did. The problem is I'm a dumb human looking at crayons that I drew, after sticking a few into my nose and into my brain. I shouldn't be right. I was.  Volume blows dick. Bullish market. Bear gang dead. Skynet has taken over. What does this mean?  We're still in the rising wedge that's supposed to resolve by Nov 14. JPow testifying to Congress at the same time. On that same date, the first public impeachment hearing will also be held.  At his last testimony in July, the market did not in a negative fashion as he suggested rate cuts. We've cut them already.   Based on patterns, euphoria will continue. Crayons say 309.5-310 before close on Tuesday. Given the closure of the bond market on Monday, if we see bullish trading without real news I'll put my money where my mouth is and buy puts either Tuesday or Wednesday if we are still trading in the rising wedge pattern ranges I outlined. The news events I listed above will be used as an excuse for why a pullback may occur, but really, it's an excuse to cover up the fact that Skynet is here and see the same things I'm seeing. If we trade flat and exit the rising wedge I'll stay on the sidelines.  If you're bullish and think the wedge will resolve positively, anticipate a jump to 313-315 at/around mid-week or flat trading for the rest of the week. If you're bearish, the support is 307ish, which is the puts I will grab if we enter the ranges I mentioned above. Because sentiment is still bullish, too OTM puts are at your own risk.  Have a great weekend and see you all in the weekend thread. I'll be hugging my tinfoil hats and shoving more crayons into various orifices.

Navarro says NO to any rollbacks during phase 1. And the December tariffs would be delayed not cancelled outright.  The American ask for phase 1 is a commitment to buy like $50 billion in soybeans over two years, the demand for that much American soybeans hasn't existed since like 2012 and China has already shifted their supply chains. The demand wouldn't be there unless they roll back soy tariffs.  So essentially the Americans want China to roll back an existing tariff but they aren't willing to reciprocate.

6wk3vi|dtdwpg|dtdwpg|6|Repo for today was solid. The total NY Fed repo ops for the week is 436.5 Billion. Almost half a trillion dollars in a week. Additionally added 300B to the balance sheet in the last 2 months.   I know that they mainly get paid back next day, but a loan is a loan. If you get a payday loan for 100 bucks, pay it back, then get another 100 bucks the next day you still took 200 in loans.  Kind of mind blowing the levels of money being handled just to keep us where we are. Total Repo ops have move from a steady 1.6T from 2014-2016 to a last print of 2.46T in 10/2019. An additional trillion a month in lending.   Graph to show how hard it‚Äôs spiking: https://imgur.com/a/UF03TUW|2019-11-08 09:53:36

Yet the pump remained.  We pumped to SPY 309 when Chinese said there will be mutual tariff rollbacks. Then Navarro comes out and says actually no, there won't be any tariff rollbacks in phase 1, just possibly a delay of the planned December tariffs. So we fell all the way to SPY 308.

6wni79|dtdwpg|dtdwpg|3|The Fed has begun to grow its balance sheet again, and is purchasing mainly 1-year or shorter treasuries. This should in theory drive down the yield of short term treasuries due to increased demand. However, what we have seen instead is that 1-year treasury yields are climbing, but not as fast as 10-year treasury yields are climbing. So the yield curve is getting steeper, which benefits the banks. The bank stocks have done *extremely* well in the past month and have a lot to do with SPY being at these levels.     I don't understand a lot about bond yields, but increasing 10-year yields seem to suggest optimism about the future of the stock market and the economy overall. This is despite forecasts for Q4 GDP growth of 1% or less. Is this optimism born from trade developments, recent earnings reports, or something else? What kind of event would it take for yields to fall back to their lows of the year, and what would the consequences be for the stock market?|2019-11-08 10:30:32

6wnlhy|dtdwpg|dtdwpg|2|Looking for anyone's opinions on buying put options on Altria (MO). They have a 35% stake in Juul and just took an impairment charge of $4.5B, a third of the value of their investment. My view is Juul is headed for strong headwinds. Not only did they just continue Mint flavor, which is by far their most popular, but they face extreme competition from new cheaper and disposable ecigs. Being in a college town, I'm able to notice the trends in the ecig market and what used to be 99% controlled by Juul has plummetted to very few. I've noticed most college students have begun quitting due to the vaping crisis news or switching to Stiks, Stigs, Mylies, etc.. which are all cheap disposables. It seems no one wants the hassle of buying a $50 device that you have to charge and risk losing when you can get 2 cheap disposables with higher nic levels and better flavors for $15. With Juul in the shitter, I also don't think there's any good reason to believe people are suddenly going to switch back to tobacco products. The vaping market is dominated by young adults who didn't quit smoking for vaping but just took up vaping. This means they wouldn't switch from one vice to another when they never smoked to begin with. The stock has already been hammered due to all this news but is currently up 15% this month. Is this a good time to buy some put options or is all this bad sentiment leading to too high of a premium?|2019-11-08 10:31:32

6w9q9i|dtdwpg|dtdwpg|1|I'm using Think or Swim.  2 days ago I closed a vertical spread that I bought.    My P/L dropped under 1000 dollars before I closed the trade.    Yet when I closed the trade the P/L was about where I was before I bought the spread meaning it was as if I didn't do the trade in the first place.   TOS's account statement says that my balance increased by 517 dollars because of the trade.  What could be going on here? Am I just waiting for the money to clear?|2019-11-08 07:49:19

Down to 11.4 but if it finishes at 11.5 pattern continues.    Not sure wtf that means, MMs keeping price low so they can accumulate before earnings? Or keeping price at certain levels so they can sell off gains from the run up from 8.73->13.5?
