As long as you do not immediately need the money, do not sell. Prices usually bounce back within a few months.  * Commodities such as gold and silver are typically safe investments.  * Physical resources such as firearms and ammunition are a necessity.  * Protect your investments by barricading your home. Closet doors can be used to create makeshift shutters. Place barbed wire on the interior of windows to create entry hazards that are not easily cleared.  * Scout your neighbors. Know what their resources are. You may need to kill them before this is over.|2021-02-23 07:54:21

ogcok8|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|11|I don't believe it myself, but it looks like Disney is currently one of the safest havens.   &#x200B;  1. **Clowns are right and Corona will be over in a few weeks:**   Scenario is self-explanatory... Disiney benefits massively from reopening of theme parks and cruise ships. 2. **Corona will last at least until 2022 or even longer**:    Disney's streaming business is booming and they have even managed to make a profit despite Corona (against all expectations).  3. **Yield shitshow goes into the next round:**   Disney took on more debt during Corona, so rising interest rates could lead to trouble. However, the condition for rising interest rates is the end of Corona and thus the occurrence of scenario 1. That means Disney will have absolutely no problems to pay debts.  4. **Yield shitshow has an imminent end:**   For the current situation, see point 3: In this scenario, Disney can take on more debt and thus push its streaming service further and increase revenues again.   &#x200B;  In summary: Disney will benefit massively no matter what happens in the near future (1-2 years).|2021-02-23 06:36:01

Anger ‚Äì When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; "Who is to blame?"; "Why would this happen?". 3. Bargaining ‚Äì The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for gains are made in exchange for handjobs.  4. Depression ‚Äì "I'm so sad, why bother selling?"; "I'm going to be broke anyway, so what's the point?"; "I miss my money; why go on?"   During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their losses. 5. Acceptance ‚Äì "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it; I may as well prepare for it."   In this last stage, individuals embrace the inevitable future of giving handjobs behind Wendy's|2021-02-23 08:15:43

Of course your risky option plays are gone, but your stocks will reach new highs in no time (few weeks/months). TSLA, NIO, Hydrogen, all gone just because yields are going up? Hahaha every fucking country in the world is planning to be CO2 neutral by 2030. Tech is no longer used because Corona is over? Hahahah of course, no one will use smartphones, computers or the internet tomorrow. Internet Money will drop to 0$ just because a 90 year old grandma doesn't like it? Yes definitely, that's why the fattest investors and biggest payment companies in the world just said a few weeks ago that they will enable their use. Airlines and cruise lines are new cashcows just because Deutsch Bank says so? hahah yeah sure airlines that were already losing money before Corona are certainly a good buy!

Not just for specific car companies. Anyone. They will own the system, but the car manufacturers will own the data.  Revenue by toll (part of app purchase) or annual subscription fee....who cares.  Huge barrier to entry.  They are capitalizing on BB's first user advantage...175M cars.  If an Apple or Tesla wanted to do this, they'd have to start a system with minimal cars and ask them to join a small system.  This is the equivalent of when Apple had enough phones out there that they could then open up an App Store. They don‚Äôt get all the money for each app, but they get a take of anything sold on the ecosystem.  By the way, Apple has $64B in sales on their App Store.

Look for a continued drift lower on no major developments.   If  No Major Developments in the SWAMP continue look for it to ratchet up to a Level 5 Tantric Tantrum.   If you do not know what a Tantric Tantrum is then go ask your wife's lesbian lover who can actually satisfy her.

ogy6r7|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|9|When I was in 5th grade and my parents bought me a gameboy advance and Pok√©mon / Crash Bandicoot game. I was so happy I brought it to school and let some other kids play at recess.   At the end of recess I realized the Crash Bandicoot game was gone and I was so distraught. I couldn‚Äôt pay attention in class and randomly walked around classroom and playground looking for it desperately. I asked the aides and teachers about it and they expressed concern but ultimately did nothing.  There was a poor, Hispanic kid who last played with it and I suspected him for the wrong reasons so I looked into his backpack when no one was watching and there it was - tucked under a sweater, my game cartridge.   I went to the teacher to report it and got in trouble for looking in his backpack. That was probably one of the most disappointing days of my life and all this loss today is just a walk in the park üí™üèºü•±ü§ó|2021-02-23 09:46:56

PLTR at these levels is a good value l, security will only keep getting more vital.   VGAC is a spac that actually has a business and is branching out.

The  market is correcting, do people buy the dip and save holders from a  stock free-fall or does everyone try to sell and re-enter lower?  We've all been taught to buy the dip, which adds to market stability.  Will you trust others to buy the dip, or will you cash out and save yourself..  Questions I ask myself every time I see red. haha|2021-02-23 09:35:44

ogackx|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|6|Elon‚Äôs latest tweet decoded:  https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1364180853866131456?s=20  Excession:  The book is largely about the response of the Culture's Minds (AIs with enormous intellectual capabilities and distinctive personalities) to the Excession itself, a black swan event, and the way in which another society, whose systematic brutality horrifies the Culture, tries to use the Excession to increase its power. As in Banks' other Culture novels the main themes are the moral dilemmas which confront a hyperpower and how biological characters find ways to give their lives meaning in a post-scarcity society which is presided over by benign super-intelligent machines. The book features a large collection of Culture ship names, some of which give subtle clues about the roles these ships' Minds play in the story. In terms of style, the book is also notable for the way in which many important conversations between Minds resemble email messages complete with headers.  What is a black swan event?   Black Swans, Markets, and Human Behavior A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight.  Head for the hills.|2021-02-23 06:07:55

As long as Europoors and Brexitors have Ameripoor stocks in their portfolio, and this yield shit continues, they have much less to worry about than Ameripoors.   The dollar has lost \~20% against the EUR and GBP since Corona. All the shit currently is based on the expectation that the FED will counter inflation and therefore may raise rates in a timely manner. What will happen to the dollar? It will appreciate again and thus EUR and GBP will depreciate against the dollar. Europoors and Brexitors have a natural hedge in their portfolio. If the stock prices of Ameripoors rise, their currency appreciates, if the stock prices of Ameripoors fall, the dollar appreciates. So Europoors and Brexitors always profit, Ameripoors are fucked as always. Only Ameririch profits, YIKES.   God bless America|2021-02-23 05:35:48

oi0wwr|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|2|The moon shines over a freshly-dug grave. A large scavenger lumbers toward the overturned earth, lured by the scent of rotting meat. As the animal approaches, the barest movement can be seen as bits of soil faintly stir. The animal pauses to sniff the ground.  Suddenly, a hand shoots up from the dirt. The animal pulls back, but it is too late. The grip is like iron. The earth splits open, and the fetid corpse of a man flies out. It leaps onto the animal‚Äôs back, teeth and nails tearing at the animal‚Äôs throat. The bear collapses as its life savings drains away.  The monster finishes its meal quickly, and as stumbles off into the trees, it gurgles something out in a guttural, nearly unintelligible drawl:  ‚ÄúStonks... only... go... up...‚Äù|2021-02-23 14:08:35

oguds6|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|4|In this troubled times, do like the banks, invest in gold. If this Bear Market is to stay for a few weeks (maybe a month, who knows) the gold prices will rocket. There are several options: ETFs, buying real gold and saving it at home, buying mining companies. Warren Buffett chose a specific one last year, Barrick Gold, at the wrong time, it has a track of spiking during crisis like the entire sector (such as the 2007 crisis) so since Warren bought it has been falling, today is undervalued at least 50%, fundamental analysis, especial dividend incoming also. So just something to keep in mind. I have at my wallet for 2 months as a precaution and at the moment i only keep Barrick and Abbvie, the rest i will wai to buy/rebuy.  THIS IS A FINANCIAL ADVICE!!!

Stephen Cohen, Palantir‚Äôs (ticker: PLTR) co-founder and president, sold 2 million shares, on Feb. 18, 19, and 22, at prices ranging from $25.07 to $30.03 a share. Those sales generated proceeds of about $53.6 million. The stock sales reduced Cohen‚Äôs stake to 203,647 shares.  Matthew Long, the general counsel, sold 503,864 shares on Feb. 18, at prices ranging from $25.04 to $25.86 a share, for proceeds of about $12.6 million. Long now holds 781,939 shares.  Ryan Taylor, chief legal officer and business affairs officer, sold 218,255 shares on Feb. 18, at prices ranging from $25.07 to $25.85 a share, raising about $5.5 million. Taylor continues to hold 1.58 million shares.

ogjrqq|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|-1|A few thoughts for my fellow apes.   First - as fun as the GME raw dogging was, can we ease up on only upvoting and posting about GME and GME alone? Listen Im still diamond handed and down 80%+.  Ill hold it until Papa Musk and Rabbi Cohen forgive us of our sins and send us to the heavens.  That being said the GME circle jerk banana fap factory that this place has become is fucking exhausting.  Secondly - short selling is not market manipulation you dumb fucks.  In fact, if not for short selling we wouldn't have seen GME go semi-moon in the first place.  Did our ape butts get penetrated by RH?  Of course they did.  But the short positions were the jet fuel that got us off the ground in the first place, it was the lube that allowed us entrance into Shitron and Melvins backdoor, and you can be damn certain it will be the tendie catalyst for the next time us retards stumble upon a gamma squeeze.  This is the way.  Now shut up about GME and give me the next play.  Apes strong together, whatever, fuck you lets get rich|2021-02-23 07:49:53

ogvu4z|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|1|You want to know why meme stocks are dropping hardest? Because people invested in them got the worst economical education. You guys get inflation wrong...   If one does not understand the meaning and the goal of inflation at this point, the logical conclusion would be to accuse the Fed of a bad monetary policy. To support the monetary policy approach of the FED and also the ECB, it is worth taking a look at Japan (for this I quote an older comment of mine):  >The low-interest phase in Japan began with the bursting of a real estate bubble. At that time, the Japanese central bank failed to counteract the crisis with appropriate monetary policy measures. The reason for Japan's continuing economic stagnation is mainly deflation - a persistent decline in the price level for goods and services.   Deflation can lead to depression, and in Japan it has done so impressively. One instrument to counteract deflation is quantitative easing, as the inflation target can be achieved by expanding the monetary base, even if conventional monetary policy measures (e.g. interest rate cut) are no longer effective.   The goal is inflation to stimulate consumption and investment. As an example: Would you buy a car today if you knew it would be 5% cheaper next year (deflation)? No. Would you buy a car if you knew it would be 5% more expensive next year (inflation)? Yes.   So the biggest goal of the Fed, the ECB and the rest of the central banks is to create inflation. This is also reflected in the valuations of shares. So rising stock prices mean that inflation is underway. Also, you should be happy when you notice when you go shopping that you have to pay more (as stupid as it sounds).   How to avoid hyperinflation is another story, because it could also lead to big problems.  TLDR: At this point (with the ongoing Pandemic) inflation is good and neccasary to keep the system running.|2021-02-23 09:29:08

ohnn3f|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|-10|I am in no way an expert in the market. I'm novice at best. I do consider myself rather knowledgeable in the field of human nature, having been immersed in it as an actual human for many years. And what we have here folks is the classic scenario of wanting math to do what it doesn't just because....we want it to. And math is dispassionate. It just does its thing. That thing being logic. And what is not logical is a continued belief that companies which trade at prices which in no way reflect even remotely mathematically sound values will not eventually fall in price so to reflect actual sound mathematical values.   But that's not even the prime driving force. How could it be since the market, while being composed of money, its primary value makers are people and what they do with the money. And once the math starts rearing its buddha head of purity in a manner which people can no longer wish away...well that is when the wind stops blowing - for second - and then begins a gentle breeze possibly increasing to gale force in the opposite direction.   All of life is the seeking of balance and the market is no different, duhh...because it is a thing created by and continued by life. A sell off is occurring. A decline is occurring. The ony question is how low will it go before balance occurs. Personally - two weeks ago - I called Tesla at 716 by 3/19. I was a little off there but fortunate enough to get completely out of it at 818 and change and I said bye bye to ARKK as well.   Now what am I doing? Since I'm a newbie with not much skin in the game and not alot of knowledge about the ins and outs of this and that I'm doing options 101. Buying puts all over the board. I will happily spread the descending wealth through the payment of premiums because this market is diving like an eagle I saw once while driving on a lakeshore in the Seattle area...that bird dropped like a rock and went under the water. Came up with a rainbow trout in its talons, rose high and flew away. I figure at this point that bird is about 20-30 feet away from its fish.  Good luck to all of you no matter which way you play this thing.|2021-02-23 12:32:39

ogmde6|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|-28| Sharp declines are on the horizon.   Only took 33 days for the new leadership to F'up so much so fast.   Yup, it's time to look at moving all longer term investments to the sidelines.   Inflation on the horizon.   Time to get strong into shorting. ANY Major Poppers in a morning are prime money makers for large drops later that day & for the following days.   ANY earnings reports will probably sell the news.     Markets are a disaster.   \*Pipeline stopped leading to dramatically fast rising gas prices. Sure! let's go back to depending on the oil producers in the world who hate America instead of being a self sufficient nation with oil.   \*Iran again being allowed to head towards nuclear weapons. Sure! let's loosen everything so the the major terrorist nation in the world can get weapons to destroy anyone they hate, and they hate so many. Kerry worked with Iran against the Trump administration?? No problem cause we hate Trump!   The great alliance forged with Israel again being ripped apart? Sure! let's F over the one country in that part of the world that is America's friend.   Stimulus package has 80%!!! spending that has nothing to do with Covid relief? Only 20% is actual Covid related relief. Sure! no problem- let Nancy have billions for her pet projects. Let's save those states that have been run into the ground by that disaster Governors & now can have their coffers refilled by using the Covid disaster as their bank.   America again in the Paris climate accords. Sure! let's go back into the 'give us your money' accords when America on it's own has been working to reduce pollution.     We are reaping what has been sown.   Amazing how people don't learn.   Amazing how people vote with their hate.   The complaints will be coming very soon when this chit hits peoples pockets.|2021-02-23 08:13:26

ogu3pm|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|-2|@orlandomadrid1 since they operate as a REIT, they have to pay 90% of the profit as dividend. Now its $1 annually. EPS estimates (3 more probably lost BOP contracts this year, some facilities come live e.g. in Alaska, covid slowly moves out so reduces further costs and increases occupancy levels...etc) EPS estimates can range between 0.96-1.3, so take the 90% of that, lowest divi could be 0.865 and the highest 1.17 (just rough estimates). The dividend might be reduced further but i believe that their recent moves and institutional investor interest (blackrock, burry) and a potential short squeeze plays in the more bullish side. I am avg 8.52 and 9.50 on another account, i dont want to lose money so i dont sell it, the core business is in a good stable state and the stock is currently undervalued and oversold (hated sector), but its services are essential and the trend could pick up with higher inequalities and immigration (thinking about the largest revenue source, prisons), there are other sources of revenues also (healthcare, counseling, construction) so its is well-diversified (also more operational countries but US is by far the largest customer).|2021-02-23 09:15:41

oi1ov4|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|-2|   I just joined your group and thought I would share something that's coming .   Number one state governments are shut down all over the country meaning, millions of construction jobs have come to a grinding halt! For example in Arizona there is over 3 billion in infrastructure projects with no start date! leaving almost 2 million people out of work for the past year.  Number two Native American Tribes have received less than .23% in covid-19 relief funds? that's roughly 3.5 million of 1.5 billion for the 562 registered tribes, distributed equally that's $6,227 per tribe, additionally they have lost over 20 billion in casino revenues and the regular federal dollars received are on hold.  Number three- Small businesses are on the fringe of collapse due to the SBA's lack of loans and restrictions placed upon them. For instance a small business can borrow up to 2,000,000 but only 150,000 for each business meaning they would have to have 13 additional businesses to receive the money they needed, some businesses qualified for this rule and went to apply but the SBA denied there loans and not one small business has received an additional loan above the 150k.  So you think its tough now with the B.S. restrictions they have slapped on our trading platforms? its nothing compared to what is coming! there just getting started with the raping!|2021-02-23 14:13:28

ogvvu8|lqfr4s|lqfr4s|-26|the reddit movement is dead, you are too greedy, and stupid. scattered over several actions, your actions are in vain. focus on an action vote and stop wasting your money unnecessarily to give it to robots or big funds. you have no pride. they got you with robinhood, they brought down amc and gme. gme went up to $ 470 amc made 300%. because you were united. but here you are saying PLTR, TESLA, BB, SNDL, APHA, HYLN, ETC ... You are puppets and CLOWNS. Shame on you So choose an action, avoid being disciplined. And that we recover our money that we take revenge on GME and Amc. they violated the rules of the market we must act intelligently. Choose a single action I take AMC but if I have to choose another one I will do it for the Reddit community. Only one action to take or 3 maximum. But not more...|2021-02-23 09:29:30
