Our economy is thriving and Americans are winning!  Under [@POTUS](https://twitter.com/POTUS)’ leadership, the auto  industry is roaring back in MI! This year alone, GM announced it will add 400 jobs, Ford has announced it will create 900 new jobs & Fiat-Chrysler is already building a $1.6B new assembly plant that will create 6,400 jobs in the Motor City!  For years, "anti-business policies squeezed corporations and left American workers out of the economic recovery," [@SecretaryRoss](https://twitter.com/SecretaryRoss) writes.  Today, President [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) ’s policies are helping American companies AND American workers succeed together. Because of [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump)'s policies, American companies and their workers are succeeding together.|2019-08-20 08:20:49
