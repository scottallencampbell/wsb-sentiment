I really don't understand why someone would buy this.  BILLIONS , and billions and billions of dollars have been lost on expiring FD puts.  It's probably why the biggest reason why I ran for president.  Because I saw for so many years how come nobody is doing anything about it.  On June 16 I took the great presidential office of President to do everything I could about it to give autists a fair chance on their worthless FD's.  And I actually think I have more than kept my promise.  We have daily .5% moves on the SPY, stonks go up, stonks go down.  They just have to get their timing right, they just have to get the timing right, right folks?  And believe me, I know all about timing.  I'm the greatest at timing.|2020-01-15 11:29:09

It may be too volatile of a stock for ya’ll but given its ranked top 100 stocks on brokerage firms and I have profited over 300% on stocks alone in the past 2 months it might be a good buy right now. Do your own DD and you’d be pretty optimistic as I am about the companies future. May the odds be ever in your favor, tah tah for now|2020-01-15 07:27:10

egxwlb|ep0xus|ep0xus|2|Quadrupled down on the recent Antares dip. My chart is looking like a rollercoaster. Over 100 options, over 2000 shares. Everything up over 50% since buy, was 100% but got shot down for a bit there. Consolidation played out nicely though at these levels, not much reaction to AMAG fiasco and they seem to be leaning towards keeping Makena and not selling off the rights.   Generic forteo this year (TEVA, already released in EU; unlikely hiccups), disclosure Pfizer project this year, disclosure of QSM Antares trials shortly, idorsia heart attack drug improvements, Eu expansion for Xyosted. Expecting most to happen in Q3 but so far expecting 33-35m revs Q4 topline year revenues, nothing spectacular but a beat nonetheless. Won’t be a pretty run up but its consistent at least   90% of my pharma play account, my day trading moved to TD. At least until I can get more time to be more active, anything before 2018 Antares dud but getting a solid backbone now, 2020 overall will match 2019s 50% minimum, I’d be stunned if it’s less than 70%. Would still triple my account tho. !Pharma is never without risk!|2020-01-15 10:16:20

Could be a similar situation to TGT, but you'll have to assess how high the vol is priced in.  TSLA has this weird situation where it's IV is much higher in the front weeklies than the back weeks, which means there's a ridiculous amount of theta you can collect if you are brave.

egqenj|ep0xus|ep0xus|1|I'm having a hard time figuring out who is in charge at Wells Fargo's "Wealth and Investment Management division". They seem to be shuffling people around like a frenetic game of musical chairs.  There was a guy named Jay Welker, but he somehow got MeToo'd into retirement because some women complained. Then there was a guy named Dean Junkans, but he, too, retired.  That left us with David Kowach, running "WELLS FARGO ADVISORS" with 1.6T or 1.9T in AUM. But then I hear that he is also gone, moved over to "community banking" instead and leaving a guy named JIM HAYS in charge. To top it all off there are CIO types named Erik Davidson and Jonathan Weiss, and god only knows what they do.  NOPE -- Erik Davidson is already gone --- off doing "faith-based investing"  Can someone provide me with an up-to-date Org Chart for those guys? And also while you're at it, esplain to me the difference between a "wirehouse" and a private bank.  OK, thanks.|2020-01-15 08:54:47
