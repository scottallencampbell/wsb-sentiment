x53iut|n63s48|n63s48|1|Everything looks weird because we turned the bots off and suspended all rules for like twelve hours.  I'm about to flip everything back on with slightly more lax settings and get the sub back in order.  I know it's easy to believe stories about us and buy into memes about how we're shills or whatever, but we turned that deluge of shitposts into a decent feed every day since 2016 because we enjoy contributing. Do me a favor and challenge the next person alleging something about us to provide proof. Ask them who would benefit the most from convincing a bunch of people that /r/wallstreetbets is compromised.  If you trust me, then believe me when I say things are good. There are no shenanigans. Things have changed around us and while we can always adapt, we can't compromise and appease people when we think they're asking us to do the wrong thing. I'd rather see other stock subs carry the torch than allow rule-breaking content solely to not upset someone. I'd like to think of WSB like a sports league subreddit (NFL, NHL) and the single-stock subs as teams. There's no reason for us to fight. They can plumb the depths of their sole interest, we can be generalists. We've always had high standards while simultaneously being kinda retarded and I don't want to lose that.  I hope that all the good work we did and still do isn't forgotten for low-information insults and conspiracy theories. Don't buy all the BS, nothing has changed on our end. Same mods (without the old shill mods), same rules, same effort.  Hell, if people are still convinced that we're somehow exerting control in nefarious ways I'd go so far as to livestream mod logs/spam submission queue.|2021-05-06 07:12:22

Biggest gain was in NET (6.2%) and biggest loss in SPB (-3.18%).  Opening bell edit: Yup I'm fuk.

x5shmj|n63s48|n63s48|9|The way things have been going I adopted a strategy called The Safest Bullshit Ever. It goes like this:  1. Wait for earnings reports 2. If it seems like a red day in general, and 3. The stock just dumped after earnings, then 4. Buy as many calls as you possibly can for like 3 months from now that are already ITM or very close to it 5. Set your sell limit at 15% and walk away  Saves a lot of time frothing and worrying about the stock market and staring at a screen, and minimizes risk. Rinse and repeat.

Look,   simply put we have national debt at almost $30T, annual deficit spending $3-8T, why and how could the Fed raise interest rates on  Itself?

But if the earnings are decent or even good, it‚Äôs so oversold and really there just isn‚Äôt much downside bc it‚Äôs dirt cheap.  I bought more today at 7.05.  My price target is 10-12...someday.  I could be wrong.  My overall returns for 2021 are 300% so I‚Äôm right more often than I‚Äôm wrong.  But I definitely am bigly wrong sometimes too.  Not financial advice|2021-05-06 13:01:29

x63dsc|n63s48|n63s48|13|Unpopular opinion time:  this whole tech wreck is partly bc of apes and their imagined crusade against Wall St HFs.  I‚Äôm not just speculating here, pretty much everything in the WSB basket has been downhill since the GME/meme craze peaked (GME excluded, because whales).  It‚Äôs like the market collectively said ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù and turned on one shot kills mode for everyone who‚Äôs never seen a nightmarish rotation like this before.  Yeah I‚Äôm sure there are a bunch of exceptions but for the most part EV, small mid/cap tech, memes, green energy - all WSB favorites last year have been utterly destroyed.  Sure there are other factors at play (bond yields, interest rates, inflation fears, politics, blah blah blah this mostly noise) but you can‚Äôt ignore the timing of this and the fact that some of it is probably restitution/retribution for losses taken in meme stonk shorts.

Somehow the party blew up on facebook, the party was suppose to only be a couple of the boys. Next thing you know 100 random people showed up. There was too many randoms and the guys couldn't stop them from coming in. This mob of random people decides they hate rock and want to blast mumble rap. Well they out number the original rock guys and take over the stereo blasting their shit mumble rap.  The guys give up and decide there are too many to kick out and simply say please respect the house rules if you want to stay. Well we all know how that is working out....|2021-05-06 09:54:36

It looks exactly like all the 2000 nasdaq charts at the same time of year with a little topping pattern, peak, sell off for capital gains, then a big dead cat as the dumboz "buy the dip."  They say everybody in dotcom knew it was a bubble, but it wasn't really clear it had popped until May/June, months after the peak. Here we are again.   We either see an epic unwind over the next 6 months, or hyperinflation as the monetarists scramble to save the asset holders.

Then suddenly we had the greatest bull market in a long time and she benefited from that and was doing great. But everybody is a genius in a bull market. Now that the bull market is over she is being seen for what she is, just another autist, not a genius. ARK still has a long way down to go. Don't be fooled by her speculative risky stocks she buys with your money through ARK. She bought $Coin on IPO day when it started at $380-$420 something. That was a sign that she is just like everybody else here, she has no idea what she's doing either, just like most.

x6fzxt|n63s48|n63s48|-5| Re-posted: We need the ape gang now more than ever. The banks are the enemies. Bill Hwang is the example.   $VIAC War Cry  My fellow Apes, there is an abuse going on in the market that we must continue to fight. We've begun, we must continue. We've shown the world who we were but again that time has come to remind them of who we are. I fought alongside you all in $AMC, together in $GME, and again in $NOK, wherever I heard the cry of my fellow Apes, I came through with action, buying shares into the high. What brought us together if not the fight for fairness (and of course profit). Brothers, Apes, our time is upon us, yet again. Oversold and undervalued, greedy shorts have not learned their lesson. Are we not strong? Are we not stronger together? Are we not the reckoning of abuses in an one sided market? Did we not bring Citadel to an apology? Should we not continue to strike fear in the hearts of hedge funds, shorts, abusers? Or should we let our foot off their necks? We must not sleep until they ask themselves, "Will the Apes show up?". May we go down in history, rewriting the abuses that have gone on far too long. They've brushed us aside, labeled us a blip in time. Damnit, We will not be ignored! We will not be forgotten! Let's leave those candy ass shorts sucking thumbs in a corner. The perfect opportunity is here in $VIAC, the time is now. Will you show up for the fight? Will we complete our chapter in history?

If that was the case they wouldn't have even bothered seeking the injunction. NASDAQ will at least delay the deadline as a result of this new information, and once they complete their review it will continue to be listed. They have been holding onto PR's for a while, just go look at the chart of the partners they have (Ferrari, Ford, Amazon Web Services among hundreds more...)|2021-05-06 06:25:57

x50rup|n63s48|n63s48|1|TWLO puts after earnings?   They put up 590MM revenue, including 44.6MM of revenue from a recent acquisition; a very weak gain over 548MM in q4, and only projected 590MM revenue for q2. They lost nearly 200MM this quarter and projecting a wider loss than wall street wanted for q2.  at 600MM per quarter(2.4B per year) they are trading at 24x revenue without showing any significant revenue gain from q4 2020 to q2 2021 projections.  Stock deserves a 50% haircut imo, good product but it ain't showing up where it matters.  Thoughts?|2021-05-06 06:43:09

x5jg1x|n63s48|n63s48|-2|Lots of amateurs on here. I‚Äôm still very new to investing in stocks but I keep seeing predictions based solely on how bad a stock has been performing. Most people on here think pltr will keep going down only because it‚Äôs had a bad few months. It‚Äôs possible. At some point it has to go back up. It‚Äôs not a bad company at all. Tesla was stuck at $50 for years until it started going crazy. Maybe pltr will get to $19 but it will go back up at some point. Also just because the market is down doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make money. I‚Äôve made $300 on 2 spy puts yesterday and today. I sell a few days before expiration. I started with only $250 a month ago and I‚Äôm up to $2100 already. I could invest more but I believe I should only risk what I‚Äôm comfortable losing. I‚Äôm waiting for the market to stabilize to make riskier plays. I want to see how high I can take this $250. The investment advice on here is fun but I wouldn‚Äôt let anyone on here manage my 401k.|2021-05-06 09:27:11

I think people are because you're obviously not 'suppressing' them today, lol.  The fact the front-page is pro-GME again is not some organic change but just shows that for whatever reason you're letting the community post what they find most interesting; conversely, it demonstrates just how much you have been suppressing them over the past few weeks.  Honestly though all these tongue-in-cheek attempts at humour (and trying to make points?) shows how far removed from the base of this sub you've all become, not to mention how no matter what actions you take (suppress or not suppress) it's difficult not to lord over the sub with these types of top-down comments.|2021-05-06 07:39:43
