k70vv2|qritp2|qritp2|14|>	China Evergrande Group once again averted a default with a last-minute payment of coupons on three dollar bonds before the 30-day grace period ended. It comes amid wider speculation that the crackdown on the property market in China is starting to ease, with a series of articles published in state media signaling support measures may be on the way. A gauge of real estate stocks jumped 5.7% overnight and high-yield dollar bonds rose. Despite the increased optimism on a resolution to the problems, the wider fallout from slowdown in the Chinese property market is clear.  So they didn’t default? No idea what’s going on here.|2021-11-11 06:29:11

Kinda ironic that many considered the economy to be overheating PRIOR to covid.  Rate hikes 2015-2019 were well-received generally.    Apparently though now the problem is not too much money pumped into debt markets, shitco IPOs / spacs, and real estate.  It's that "real" supply hasn't caught up!|2021-11-11 11:42:34

k7bl4c|qritp2|qritp2|20|this inflation is not that bad... it's tepid.. i am currently living (and have lived) in countries where normal inflation is 15-30% - where the prices on menus in restaurants are written in wax pencil so they can change them daily.  These are countries where the gov only hurts the situation.  The FED has so many tools and capabilities to manage inflation. If you look at the data, the majority of the CPI is tied to fuel costs.  Both direct fuel for autos, and it's trickle down effects on the rest of the economy.          I'm in the oil/gas business,  and like it or not, higher fuel prices mean more jobs, and not just directly in the industry.  It trickles down to large purchases and even real estate.           What i don't get is why republicans bitch about higher gas costs when they are the ones keeping the oil industry pumping by diminishing climate change and pushing against clean energy.

k87p19|qritp2|qritp2|5|I don't know why people say the Rivian truck and the Ford Lightning are in competition. The Rivian truck is double the price, smaller, has a longer battery range, and does 0-60 in 3 seconds. Whereas the Ford is much bigger, has more utility uses like serving as a generator to power your entire house during a blackout, is priced comparably to their current F-150s and again starts around 40k vs the Rivian 75k.   They're for two completely different groups. Contractors and companies will absolutely buy the Ford for it's size and power bank functionality. And wealthier people who want a truck sized sports car will go with the Rivian.|2021-11-11 11:50:17

k8ovib|qritp2|qritp2|4|u/AxemanFromMA and anyone else buying the 12/31 500c - if you plan on holding those anywhere near to the date of expiration, you’re basically betting on SPY going up almost $40 between now and then. Look at the amount SPY has moved between 11/10 and 12/31 for the last few years.   In 2018, SPY went *down* by about $20 between those dates  In 2019, SPY went up by about $11 between those dates  In 2020, SPY went up by about $15 between those dates  I’m not saying it can’t happen because it could, but it seems pretty unlikely. Yes, growth speed has accelerated, but still. If we get a few really big days in the next couple of weeks, $7-$10 days or something, you’ll probably be good, but if shit continues like it has been the last couple weeks those contracts are fucked.|2021-11-11 13:45:17

But while it's doing that, the character arcs and the overarching mystery of the plot are all centrally connected to a meta narrative about the story getting more and more ridiculous. It's a show about people in a cartoonish world coping with the accelerating levels of cartoonish bullshit they have to put up with as they're increasingly torn between the world of their creators producing the show and that of their audience consuming it. In theory, such a show could never die."   Justin Roiland: "Dude, sick. I do silly drawings and funny voices, we should team up."  Dan Harmon: "... funny voices, you say?

k8tef4|qritp2|qritp2|-4|500C 12/31 DD  https://ibb.co/dBqtBwt  https://stockanalysis.com/average-monthly-stock-returns/  Many of you don’t understand the market lag in the summer was because of Evergrande/China (second highest GDP) going into a possible reccesion till of last night. We have Build Back Better coming in and Nov/Dec/Jan are the most bullish months. Also the market is still in the COVID bubble look at Nov ROI% vs the average. The COVID bubble isn’t ending till possibly next year. Watch any FED meeting and they have heavy emphasis of Delta Strain.  Therefore a $30 increase by 12/31 is easily achievable.|2021-11-11 14:16:13

If you really want to make money buy puts on SPY500 for 11/19 wait till the 18th and collect. Don't check your phone often it will go up and down.

k6vbey|qritp2|qritp2|-7|I guess we're in selling pressure but we keep having theta days, today theta gang will do a big pump for Veteran's day, tomorrow they'll pump again just to make the most of the weekly momentum, and then Monday is pivot point where it can either pump for theta decay one last time or more likely all the selling pressure built up over the weekend can be let out of the cage at once. So for me I guess it'll be a call on SPXS today, another one tomorrow, and maybe a SPY put on Monday.   ^(Don't take this as advice, I have openly admitted SPY has got me fucked up today, this is me testing the strength of my psychic ability. According to what I know from past testing, I should be wrong on everything I just said, but if I'm finally getting strong enough to overcome interference on days like this, I'll be right.
