I'm bearish for the Tech market, but AMD is already bet down and I've been betting on a short term rebound/bear rally to at least $110, but hasn't really impressed.  Not sure if we dumping or pumping at open - I can exit pre-market if i want but like i said,   not sure what do to here.  **Be greedy or settle for +30% right here?**|2022-05-03 07:36:37

Solid earnings growth (+5%) and large cash balances among S&P 500 firms will support continued buyback growth. Managements have indicated a desire to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of repurchases. Buyback authorizations, a signal for subsequent executions, totaled $1.2T in 2021 and have surpassed $400B YTD, 22% above the record pace at this time last year.|2022-05-03 11:26:44
