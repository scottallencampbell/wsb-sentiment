The play is 135c 3/19. You can buy earlier ones if you'd like.  **FUBO (high risk high reward)**  This is booming today, and many believe this is going to be short squeezed to 60. Last time, this took 4 trading days to squeeze from 30 to 60.  It is hitting key support at the 20day MA @ 34.75. Closing above this on a given day is bullish.  The play is 40c 1/29.

k2nmml|l1wbdr|l1wbdr|23|Let me set the scene...  You are a 55 year old blue collar worker on the line at a Ford plant. You crushed a few too many PB&Js last night and with your calcium you need to take you are a little constipated this morning. Right now you get to take your paid 15 minute break. You say hey to Al and ask if his wife is bringing over her sweet buns this weekend, giving nod to her incredible baking but also that if given the chance you’d make her cheeks clap so hard you’d need 4 puffs of your albuterol inhaler.  You make your way to the shitter. The middle stall has been taped off because of some coronavirus shit but that’s where you and the men on the line have now stored your vintage playboys. You grab the sept 1997 playboy seeing Nikki Ziering on the cover and remember her days on price is right in 99.  You sit down on the toilet really having to shit but nothings moving and you really don’t want to pop another hemmoroid so you give it some more time.   You flip through, considering a quick tug but then feel down on yourself because you need a viagra to get it up.  You pull out your iPhone that’s in a way oversized otter box and try to click on some boomer app but mistakenly hit your default stocks app that you forgot you had but your son told you that you can watch your Ford stock that you’ve been getting steadily from the company over the years.  F  It catches your eye. Up 10%. You do some mental math and start to well up. Shit instantly flows from your asshole. You are instantly erect and start ejaculating all over the discarded Ziering rag.  Shit shit - Clint is gonna kill me for getting cum on this, that’s a huge party foul.  You check the time, back to work in 1 minute. You wipe your ass, toilet paper is smeared with blood from popping that hemorrhoid. Back to work you go... so quickly you forgot about the 10% gain in your boomer portfolio and no clue hundreds of autists are collecting tendies while you get back on your rivet gun cranking out more F150s.|2021-01-21 10:16:45

I didnt realize IV was insane -big mistake. any downtick id get fucked over. but when it went up it barely edged up.  Second fuck up - not noticing im out of day trades.  &#x200B;  so im panicking being down 20% really fast, and remembered i can sell a higher call. I sold it but it wasnt great as i sold it as stock was going down so less meat on the bone.  &#x200B;  at least i now capped my losses at about 30% .  &#x200B;  today opens, i see stock tumbling and i went from down 17% or so to down 25%.  I wait and when i feel its bottomed i buy back ones i sold at 1/3 the price i sold them at.  Then i wait and close the other ones when i realized im +15%. I was hoping just to save the trade but it was good to be + on it.|2021-01-21 09:36:22

k39dyr|l1wbdr|l1wbdr|5|Something I haven't seen today is talk surrounding TSM. Apple is slated to release killer earnings next week, and TSM manufactures all their custom silicon. A nice revenue jump for APPL will certainly substantially add  to TSM's story. TSM took a bit of a hit because of their projected capex with regard to their investment in new facilities for their upcoming 3nm process. This seems really short-sighted. Of course TSM needs to invest to stay ahead of the competition! They are the world leader, and want to remain so. Further Intel is said to be contracting some of its chip lines to TSM... so all in all it's an extremely bullish outlook for the company.|2021-01-21 12:57:07

I know you all like pretending to be cutthroat greedy sociopaths who need 1000% gains on every successful trade to make your dick hard even if you can only achieve that with trades that fuck the other side, but let's be real, most of us are sweethearted nerd kids who act tough because an ex girlfriend traumatized us and some win-win human cooperation is really what we all need deep down.|2021-01-21 05:21:13

k2dex9|l1wbdr|l1wbdr|3|Buy weed penny stock and hold it until it pays as much in dividends as it cost to buy right now. It's dipping because they just filed a $400m shelf registration with the SEC which they're going to use to milk cash flow out of the impending rise in stock price which will hold back that increase in price and slow it down pretty significantly so today's dip is just an adjustment to future returns becoming a bit delayed. But this dip is one of the best chances you'll get if not the absolute best chance you'll get to buy in at a low price before climbing through the growth phase to big gain money. Only way you'll get a better chance than this is if the big crash happens in such a way that it drags random penny stocks like this down with it|2021-01-21 08:55:37

If NOK hits $10 the amount of outstanding shares will not matter. Stop fear mongering and stomping on shit before it begins.

NOK is getting infrastructure contracts from all over the world and has a contract to put the first cellular network on the more. Next warning report it’s going to Mars.

k237ok|l1wbdr|l1wbdr|4|AMZN will continue to run up into earnings (Feb 4). Next week should be juicy when MSFT reports and has solid cloud growth. Already a nice return on my Feb 5 3450Cs. Nice to see volume return yesterday (\~25% over average the past 6 months), momentum returning. I also expect very solid earnings.  Funds will continue rotating back into Big Tech as the "easy money" plays dissipate in the market and digital currencies under pressure from ol gal Janet. Resilient, predictable cash flows with many growth catalysts remaining.  I don't want to shill AMZN, I don't think WSB has nearly enough capital to move it anyway. I just think it's a good play, with lower near term risk relative to some of the meme stocks. For your consideration.|2021-01-21 07:19:01

You can pay a small fee on the chain that all the cars are connected to via a smart contract and once that transaction reaches the public ledger, all of the cars in the way of your exit will agree to move all without causing a disruption in the flow of traffic because everything is autonomous and on the bchain.

k2d7id|l1wbdr|l1wbdr|2|HA! dumbfucks at JP Morgan trying to say MAXR is “old space” and downgraded to neutral while upgrading PT to 55. Bitch we are the gold standard of commercial satellite imagery. When you use google maps, that’s maxar providing those satellite views. We have 3D mapping and HD resolution from space, perfect for autonomous drive mapping (what up Elon). We have software as a service, oh and btw we’re launching the Worldview Legion constellation in September which TRIPLES our imagery collection capabilities.   You can sell or sit on the sidelines if you want to, but if MAXR isn’t $100 EOY you can ban me permanently. Gotta gimme flair if I’m right though, as it would be the second time I’ve cheated death on here via MAXR.   Positions: approx 88% MAXR leaps , 8% PLTR leaps, 4% BA leaps|2021-01-21 08:53:54
k2dar2|l1wbdr|l1wbdr|2|>	The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell slightly last week to 900,000, still a historically high level that points to ongoing job cuts in a raging pandemic.  900K out of 300M Americans doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, tbh. Of course it would be ideal if those people could find work but you gotta take what you can get. 🤷🏼‍♂️|2021-01-21 08:54:39

The chairman of the board gets bored and just stands up from his chair one day and says "you know what, it's been real, but I'm just gonna go chill at home and collect my dividends." Everyone else on the board of directors are like "wait, we can do that? I'm going too, this shit is boring." The CEO is like "if nobody cares what I do I guess I might as well just go get another job at another company and not fire myself from this one and just keep collecting salary and dividends and stuff from this without ever showing up to work." Then all the other C-level executives are like "well if nobody's watching us anymore we might as well go start another company and just keep using the money and dividends from our jobs and shares here to fund our private business." Then the SEC is like "you can't do this" but literally all the shareholders as well as all the people trading the company's stock every day are like "shut up go away nobody likes you SEC why are you even here" and the SEC is like "wtf I'm trying to protect you from open fraud" and everyone starts throwing tomatoes at them so they just leave very confused. Then all the remaining employees and chief engineers and HR people and stuff are like "this is bullshit, I should have shares" but there's nobody left at that level of management to give them shares but the HR people can still give each other raises and give out bonuses and stuff and they realize it's basically up to them to control the company and keep it financially afloat now but the shareholders are paying zero attention and there is no pressure at all except from themselves wanting to keep their own jobs.   This would be fine|2021-01-21 06:51:08

k2us4t|l1wbdr|l1wbdr|-13|Hello my friends! Love this discussion and WSB. I have made a ton of money with you retards already! GME was a good play—- Never thought I would find a place for such egregious behavior and blatant stupidity from idiots like myself. Was wondering if anyone had thoughts on when RECEY will be profitable ? I just don’t see how England could let this company ever fail. Would be like if we(USA) let Ford fail can’t ever happen and RYCEY is 3-4x lower than just 1 yr ago. Once the airline industry is back they will have cash flow again and as well they are getting into space exploration. With the brand name Rolls-Royce I think it still carries a prestigious perception. With all these space companies exploding in value why would this not happen with Rolls? Anyone else have any thoughts on this? I would love to hear every reason I am a fa-goat, bear, boomer smarty pants.|2021-01-21 11:08:49
