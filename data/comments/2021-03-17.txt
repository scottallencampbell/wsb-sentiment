r9iu3y|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|482|Every single story being told about what really happened with wallstreetbets recently is **wrong**, or worse. Watch a minute or two of this video from the time I deep-linked.   https://youtu.be/y5ar6E46Hio?t=283  Portnoy has his bad ideas out loud. Portnoy was also buddies with our deposed founder. The second he finds out about nerdcoins he has the idea to pump and dump them on his own audience. Mark Cuban showed up in /r/wallstreetbets (at the request of former scammer mods) to shill NFTs and decentralization too.  Weird huh? Remember this. It'll probably become clear within the next week or two why I'm starting to show you more of the truth of what happened. I offered the story to vice and others and they wouldn't commit to not including some scam crypto pitch, so I know which side they're on.  The above should make it less weirdly random and more suspicious that the Winklevii and Cuban were featured in GameStopped, or that the legacy media can't stop interviewing our deposed founder and showering him in money, deals, etc, despite literally being removed for scamming and also [harvesting emails to sell to scammers](https://i.gyazo.com/9e5589650d194d58e0638477b677f1a5.png) before being kicked out.  **More to come.** The rabbit hole is deep.|2021-03-17 13:23:16

r8z6oj|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|13|There was a company that DFV had written on one of his lists for companies to look into. I can't mention it here because it's too low cap. But they make security stuff, are a household name and have a share price under a dollar.  They're slowly climbing.  I didn't look into 'em too bigly but they seem to have a low float and I feel like the name alone is worth more than they're currently trading for.  Edit: If you just sprayed someone in the eyes with pepper spray... 'You ___ed someone.'  I ain't saying it's going anywhere and if my understanding of their financials is anywhere near correct, their annual revenue is about half of their market cap (I seriously am not good at reading financials yet, I'm trying.

r8a0m9|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|9|PLTR thoughts? We bounced up from the 22 area last week. I see three scenarios for the coming week or two:  -If we are forming an uptrend channel we should bounce off 23-24 (fib retracement is around 23.80 I believe).  -We retest 20-22 and double bottom  -We go sub 20.   My bet is we don't make a double bottom but instead a cup and handle, bouncing off 23-24 range this week and uppies for next week.  Positions: 2k shares  3/19 26.5p (bought when we were at 27)  4/16 22/30c  Looking to buy more calls at 23/24 range and will again if we retest 20/22.|2021-03-17 07:23:35

She went on to become one of the Top Gear presenters. You know, adopting animals is awesome, really. But let's take some of those tendies and put it into cancer research. It'll help us all.

Nasdaq down only 1% while 10 year yield is up 0.05% feels like growth investors are mostly done selling.  I still feel like most of this "bond tantrum" has been driven by overbought conditions in tech that were present throughout last summer/fall and exacerbated by the election and stimulus expectations.  (Also just the EV/battery stock speculation of the end of last year was 1999-ish as a valuation bubble and profits needed to be locked in at some point; a lot of those EV stocks went up 2000-5000% last year...).  Of course I could be completely wrong, but just feels difficult to believe that investors will rush to the exits today after the past 6 weeks of mostly selling on growth stocks.|2021-03-17 08:11:32

r8zq3b|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|22|As usual, the market is overreacting merely in anticipation of what Powell might say and what the Fed might forecast. Most likely, Powell will announce the Fed is staying the course throughout the year, will reiterate that the Fed has tools available to keep yields in check, etc etc. No matter what he says, though, the market will probably dip and then, seemingly miraculously, it will rebound.  The paper handed retail traders who just bought in with their stimulus checks will have been shaken out, and institutions and anyone with even six months of perspective will be scooping up things at a discount.|2021-03-17 11:02:46

r82o9n|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|15|Good morning contrarians!  Welcome to Fed Day. (And Happy St. Patrick‚Äôs Day as well).  The concern is that the market could sell off even if Powell sticks to his script. That is because ‚Äòthe market‚Äô has come to rely on (and expect) more juice from the Fed. Lately the ‚Äòjuice‚Äô is YCC or yield curve control (basically showing the Fed is concerned about the long end of the curve, or longer term bond yields. This would be where Operation Twist comes in).  So from the looks of it ‚Äòthe market‚Äô could be setting itself up for disappointment here. Indeed currency markets are kind of pointing in that direction, with the US dollar strengthening against major currencies this morning. This because in this world of fiat currencies, the USD strengthens with tighter Fed policy. (Currencies are the most liquid asset class on earth and trade 24 hours a day. As such they can be a good gauge to look for when it comes to these things).  Where the more medium term future direction of the market is concerned, it‚Äôs unclear how things will be affected. We know rates will move higher eventually. The only question is when. Even when they do though, it takes time for these things to work their way through the economy.   So if there is a sell-off today, that could be a buying opportunity. Could be. Depending on what you‚Äôre looking to buy of course.|2021-03-17 05:47:16

r8t9q5|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|6|1 big thing: Wall Street's "smart money" is still betting stocks fall  Having been battered and bruised by the broad rally in stocks this year and the meme stock resurgence, bearish investors are holding onto and even increasing their short bets, wagering even more money that stocks like GameStop and AMC will sink along with the broader market.  Background: Hedge funds got burned on short positions earlier this year as meme stocks jumped by hundreds of percentage points in just weeks, and then scrambled to reduce risk and square their positions.  That precipitated hedge funds‚Äô largest week of de-leveraging since February 2009, according to data from Goldman Sachs‚Äô prime brokerage unit, CNBC noted. Yes, but: "No one is capitulating," Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, tells Axios.  "Hedge funds that are in these big mover names, they tell me: 'I‚Äôm not getting out of this trade. I just had to cut my shares because the stock price went up so much.'" "'I‚Äôm taking losses, but I think this f---er‚Äôs going back down to 10 bucks. I‚Äôm going to win eventually; it‚Äôs just a matter of me having the backbone to stay with the trade.'" Case in point: Short sellers increased their bearish bets against companies that have gone public through special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) to more than triple their value at the start of the year, rising to about $2.7 billion from $724 million, WSJ reported Sunday, citing S3 Partners' data.  But it's not just SPACs that these short sellers ‚Äî mainly hedge funds ‚Äî are targeting. They're increasingly putting down bets that broader indexes, like the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Russell 3000 will decline. By the numbers: Short bets against the S&P rose 10.2% from the end of 2020 to March 15, touching a recent high of $521.1 billion, S3's data show.  Short interest as a percentage of the S&P's total float declined by 7.8% during that time. "Traders are betting one $100 chip on the short side instead of five $10 dollar chips," Dusaniwsky says. The bottom line: Having amassed searing losses and public embarrassment and facing a euphoric bull market, Wall Street's so-called smart money continues to pile into short bets and has shown no sign of stopping or even slowing down.|2021-03-17 10:14:23

r8d4jm|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|3|# "Aphria Inc. (NASDAQ:APHA) Short Interest Down 22.3% in February"  # DD:  A lot of analysts are rising their target prices of APHA and also either already considered it a "buy" or changed from a "hold" to a "buy".  Short interest is down. I believe that's because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don't want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.  The shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower.  Two important dates:  April 14, voting on the merger takes place  On or about April 20, the merger is completed  I would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it's worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 ‚Äì $18, I personally would still buy in.  I believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.  This is not financial advice.

r8wj58|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|8|Here's the deal...we're in a unique bubble that we've never seen before (makes sense as we haven't had a global pandemic in over 100 years). We already spooked the markets last year on virus fears, but that didn't change our grossly overinflated market, in fact it got much bigger on the "easy monetary policy" the fed created..JPOW knows our economy is on the verge of reopening, COVID cases are down, vaccines are being administered quickly. Inflation will BOOM! There is no denying it. The latest CPI was bs. That number is incredibly manipulated (do some googling, the gov has many reasons to make the public think it's lower than real inflation rate). Economy is reopening, businesses coming back, and the stock market is at all time highs (not coming out of lows from a broken economy, which it should be). This market will absolutely crash 40-50% if the fed waits until we see high inflation (4%+ is in the cards), we overheat, and they are forced to dramatically raise rates. If they hint at raising rates earlier than expected (late 2022 even possible) we're going to start selling off. If JPOW pretends everything is fine while they continue to create this monster, we're going to start selling off as yields rise and markets continue to call BS on the fed's lack of judgement. Either way, we are selling. I stand by my predictions of SPY under 250 (maybe even 200) by year end at some point (these are lows, it will bounce back a lot) as well as TESLA under 200 easily. Amazing buying opportunities will be back, but they sure as hell aren't right now at these historically ridiculous levels|2021-03-17 10:39:06

Our rates haven't been raised since 2006..Fixed income is going to go in the shitter, the fed needs to have tools to use in case we actually go into a recession down the road (they can't currently unless we go negative), and these super low rates cause bubbles (stocks, mortgage, internet currency, pokemon cards, you name it.

r95g3y|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|2|Anyone looking at what's happening with Volkswagen? CEO gave a Elon Musk Style presentation on Monday at their "Power Day", the more liquid preference share VOW3 went up but the thinly traded ordinary shares VOW went through the roof and decoupled from the preference shares (they normally trade very close to each other).  The ordinary has 9% short interest according to IHS markit vs less than 8% float... 53% porsche, 20% state of lower saxony, 17% Qatar and read on bbg that the Porsche family controls another 2.3% via a trust in Austria...  The run up on the ordinary seems to have been caused by the fact that US retails are buying the american ADR VWAGY which is somehow based on the ordinary not on the pref.  looks like the shorts on the ordinary are getting squeezed, anyone else following the situation?|2021-03-17 11:44:54

r8grxz|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|1|If the Fed indicates a rate increase in the first half of 2023 or earlier, that's hawkish which is bad for stocks.  If the Fed indicates they will buy 10yr treasuries at the same pace or slower, that inflates the yield even further which is bad for growth stocks in particular but good for banks.  Bulls are basically hoping that these guys will come out and say that the most recent 1.9T stimulus was not enough. And that they will be buying a fuckload of treasuries to hold down the yield. However there's no way Powell would do that, because he WANTS inflation above 2%. Which means yields will need to be at 2% or higher just to beat inflation.|2021-03-17 08:30:49

Full disclosure - I have puts ( shill position ) and I'm not totally retarded. The rest of the post is in ape-speak - so excuse my aggressive tone.   Today's Short Interest Data on GME:  [https://imgur.com/a/DdBMBnU](https://imgur.com/a/DdBMBnU)  I pay 50$ a month for this data and it's some of the best data a   retail trader can get outside of a 20K a year bloomberg terminal. Apes   will use free shitty websites that update every three days and say it's   better data. They are lying to you. Look at the data yourself if you   want a dose of reality. Short squeeze is incredible unlikely at this   point and even if you do get one, it will be tiny in comparision to   January. Every fucking metric on this chart says so.  DYOR - and don't believe the apes. Use your own reasoning for a  change. And if for some reason you don't believe the data is real, ask a  daily threader with an Ortex account to share it for you - many will  likely do so.|2021-03-17 13:43:09

r9ddob|m6wyk2|m6wyk2|0|Anybody else notice that $77 seems to be a super important level for RBLX? If you draw a straight line at $77 since open it has a huge focus. VPOC centers on $77. I wonder what the implication is.   I feel like that‚Äôs the level it‚Äôs being shorted at the most (not a short squeeze retard). It touched it last Thursday on 2m shares and immediately dropped in huge selloff. Yesterday it was the key level.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-coronavirus-financial-crisis-record-piles-of-risky-corporate-debt-11584627925](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-coronavirus-financial-crisis-record-piles-of-risky-corporate-debt-11584627925)  This article from march 2020 explains the how fucked we are and they've only gotten worse. BTW the leveraged loans in this article are now up to $2 TRILLION.  "The epicenter of risk involves a subset of that total: $1.2 trillion in [leveraged loans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/leveraged-loans-are-back-and-on-pace-to-top-pre-financial-crisis-records-1506250800?mod=article_inline), junk-rated debt secured by corporate assets much like mortgages are backed by homes. The market has exploded, ballooning by almost 50%‚Äîor $400 billion‚Äîsince the start of 2015, as investors desperate for the high interest payments these loans provided threw cash at borrowers."  "The banks that make such loans rarely hold on to them now because of regulations passed after 2008. Instead they sell the debt directly to money managers or [repackage it into complex securities ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunt-for-yield-fuels-boom-in-clos-1508673601?mod=article_inline)that are marketed to investors around the world."  **We are so desperate to keep firms alive to save jobs that banks will literally give a loan to anyone because they make a cut and then pass on all the risk to investors who wants a high yield. This is the same thing as what the banks did with mortgages in 2008. We are STILL doing the same thing with mortgages but now also doing it with corporate debt!**  "The impact will likely be long and drawn-out. Most loans don‚Äôt start coming due until 2022 and the hardest-hit sector‚Äîenergy‚Äîis a small component of the market. Still, loan prices can fall sharply well before companies run out of cash, hurting investors who own the debt. And as business dries up for some companies, they may not be able to stay current on their existing loans."  [https://journal.firsttuesday.us/using-the-yield-spread-to-forecast-recessions-and-recoveries/2933/](https://journal.firsttuesday.us/using-the-yield-spread-to-forecast-recessions-and-recoveries/2933/)  PLEASE, look at the graph and tell me a recession is not coming. The yield gap is only going to widen as the short term rate will remain near 0 (mandated by fed) and the 10 year is expected to rise to 2.25-2.5. The yield curve inverted in mid-2019 but then it reinverted in feb 2020. JUST LOOK AT IT  * A recession occurs, on average, 22 months following a 2-10 inversion. * It‚Äôs not until about 18 months after an inversion when the stock market usually turns and posts negative returns.  I don't think that quick panic in March was the recession. When trillions in debt defaults happen then we will see the real recession!  I yield back the balance of my time.|2021-03-17 13:55:04

Quit trying to hold the ceiling up with calls. Just buy long term puts and wait for a 20% correction. After that, sell puts until you get assigned at a fair valuation in a company that isn‚Äôt SNOW, ROBLOX, CRSR, GOEV, RIOT, or any other shit meme stock.
