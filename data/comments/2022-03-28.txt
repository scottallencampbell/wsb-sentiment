I'm still in disbelief that the market is doing as well as it is right now. FFS a month ago SPY bounced off 410 as Russia invaded.

First and foremost, it's almost 15% BRKB, which is probably just going to keep kicking ass until Warren B actually dies.  Secondly, it closed above $39.50 Friday.  Thirdly, it has two expirations this week, Thursday and Friday.   3/31 $40 will definitely have, at minimum, 10k open interest at open, with .31 Delta, and .37 gamma  It went up to 39.71 over the weekend.  The cheap high Delta and high gamma means that buying NTM calls is going to cause this to squeeze unless they want to outright dump it.

2h21l8|tq5usv|tq5usv|-1|Alright guys.      Advice time.      Bought $30K in SPY and AAPL puts last month. varying expiration dates and values.      I only have $13K worth of those puts left. And they are currently worth a cool $4.5K.      Deciding if I should just sell them for a loss and go calls only again. I really thought with rate increases, possibility of a global war, the fed claiming to stop propping up markets and just how fucking inflated everything is that we would get a good drop but I guess I was wrong.      SPY 4/17 430P     SPY 4/11 440P     SPY 4/14 433P     AAPL 4/22 160P     AAPL 4/14 160P     AAPL 4/14 155P     Deciding if they have a chance or not.

If you bought in at the peak of the 2000 internet market you would still make your money back in just 14 years! If you invested at age 26, you'd be 40 when you make your money back, still plenty of time before retirement. Sure, if you listened to experts you could have bought in low and saved yourself a bunch of financial hardship but why do that when you can just HODL???|2022-03-28 10:44:24
