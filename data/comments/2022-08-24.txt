In order to make money on the bear spread, PTON only has to trade flat or down until Friday.  In order to make money on the put, PTON needs to be at 12 or below, a -10% move.  In order to not lose money on the spread, PTON needs a +4% (be of 13.88) or below move, over 14% advantage vs the put.  But the put doesn't beat the P/L of the spread until 11.50 or below, a -15% move.  Play more spreads for earnings, especially on high IV tickers.|2022-08-24 10:51:00

llndbn|wwff2z|wwff2z|8|I was only 9 years old. I love $BBBY so much, I had all the 10-Q and 10-K reports. I pray to $BBBY every night, thanking it for the life I've been given. "$BBBY is love" I say, "$BBBY is life." My dad hears me and calls me an autist. I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to $BBBY. I call him a gay bear. He hits me and sends me to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed (from Bed Bath & Beyond), really cold. I feel something warm... It's Jake Freeman! I was so happy. He whispers in my ear "This is my meme stock." He grabs me with his pale ginger hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my ass cheeks for Jake. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Jake. I can feel my butt tearing and eyes watering. I want to please Jake. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Jake looks him straight in the eye and says, "Pump and dump complete." Jake leaves through the window. $BBBY is love. $BBBY is life.|2022-08-24 09:52:29

llj0h8|wwff2z|wwff2z|11|Bbby you got fucked again huh? What’s so hard to understand. The previous squeeze happened because there were very few bagholders, lots of shorts. Buyers piled on and there were no shares left to borrow and sell.   Now, after the the recent drop. There are FRESH BAGHOLDERS. ready to SELL. in huge VOLUMES. it’s not complicated. Even IF there is a catalyst, people just want to get out of their positions and run. It’s a different context.   So they’re more than happy to sell. Because without Cohen, most of these people don’t give a shit about the “loan” or whatever.|2022-08-24 09:23:11

lluo8i|wwff2z|wwff2z|7|When you take out a student loan it isn't just $10K. It's $10K with a high % interest rate tacked on every single year until you pay it off. Your $10K loan will really cost $30K after a couple years. Considering that college is usually $20K-$50K a year average you can see how that really starts to add up in debt.   I think if interest rates were capped to between 1.5%-3% for all student loans we wouldn't need forgiveness. But with interest rates hitting highs of 18% that's why people are drowning.|2022-08-24 10:40:28

lls6jn|wwff2z|wwff2z|2|BBBY losing $100 million a month, $5 Billion debt trading at 20 cents on $, yet this sub full of lemmings who tell each other the equity is valuable.   Any attempt to enlighten them is met with shill, FUD etc.    BBBY has to BK to reject leases to close losing stores to survive.    Its simple folks, Amazon sells towels now, and its expansion during Covid killed BBBY and other brick and mortar retail.  Yet this sub wants to believe there is an investor conspiracy against brick and mortar.   I wish brick and mortar had a cost advantage vs Amazon's automated warehouses, but the fact is that it does not.   I was a finance major.  Stocks are valued by discounting future cash flow, and BBBY cash flow is hugely negative.  Assigning a positive value to negative cash flows is not a good way to invest.    Debt gets fully paid before equity gets a penny.   Debt traders value BBBY bonds at 20% of face value.|2022-08-24 10:24:14

"If bad news is good news, adding $1.1 trillion dollars of spending in under a month amid recession concerns and massive inflation is great news" one of Biden's aides who will be benefitting from the plan has said.  &#x200B;  "I feel like I keep rolling 7s" said a member of the class of 2019 who secured a job before the pandemic, got to chill instead of work for his first 3 years out of college, switched roles in one of the hottest labor markets and has yet to pay a penny on his rapidly diminishing student loans. "If BBBY just goes back over $30/share I'll be square"  &#x200B;  Economists could not be reached for comment on this rapidly developing story as they've collectively entered a debilitating existential crisis.|2022-08-24 10:15:58

lm8vbh|wwff2z|wwff2z|0|Watch the SPY EMA 50. Open a chart, set it to 1Y (daily candlesticks) and plot an EMA 50 high and EMA 50 low. (EMA 50 close is fine, but high and low offer a little more insight IMO.)  During bull runs, you typically get reversal around the EMA 50 low as support.  Just getting a drop doesn't end a run, the market oscillates. When you say "market dropped, bull run over" you're just telling people you're emotionally trading on the day like a noob and don't understand cyclical oscillation in market patterns.  We're not at a "bull run over/continuing" point... what we have is a rally that is unconfirmed after a pullback with an indeterminant chart. Yes, that means it could go up or could go down. The chart doesn't always say up or down, uncertainty is a valid position.  SPY EMA 50 high is around 410 right now and low around 404. When we have a close below 404, then bears can make a stronger claim. Until then, you're waiting for trend confirmation. A bounce of the EMA 50 with a new high above 430 after would be an extremely strong confirmation of a Bullish trend forming. Having said that the strong trend is tied to the 10Y yield, which is highly correlated.  The fact that the 10Y is up now but the market hasn't declined with it breaks the correlation at least on the intra-day. I wouldn't put too much into just a 1 day trend on this, but remember that market sell dynamics on 10Y yield increases comes from competition for the risk-free rate of return, with inflows going to bonds with escalating yields to meet demand for higher yield anti-risk positions from investment houses.  When you have the yield go up but inflows still going to equities on a break in behavior, it suggests that appetite for risk reduction assets is reducing, which may suggest either that demand for bonds was met or that institutions are putting higher multiple weights on equity returns in the nearer term, which would not be good news for bears. Right now, we're in a holding pattern on Fed news, so that's dominant, but a continuing break of the bond yield correlation would be very good news for bulls... so I wouldn't go celebrating yet, bears.|2022-08-24 12:09:26

The stock spikes you sell, and say you bought more.  This pump game is all about deceit, which is why it is illegal when it can be proven.  Get a life dudes.  Invest in stocks that make money.

ll8npr|wwff2z|wwff2z|-11|fyi for bbby, good chance it can run next week or two, but the market doesn’t think so, proof is the 8:14 red candle this morning. Don’t blow your load today, with all the bad news going around recently there will be large players like that one looking to take some off the table.  It wasn’t “hedgies” trying to kill your pump, they’re rarely backed into a corner, so if there’s a large sell, it’s probably because they wanted to sell. Keep calm, if you have shares for the love of god get some puts, you’ll be sleeping like a baby while waiting for some real bullish news.  edit: im in bbby, clearly some of you can’t even see a ticker you like next to the word puts.|2022-08-24 08:09:52
