Do you remember the last time you were up 100% on SPY puts? It was definitely back when I had more hair.    Still, buying calls doesn't make you a bull. We don't have to surrender our principles and heartfelt beliefs that this whole market is a house of cards scam waiting for implosion.

Speaking in a CNBC interview, Kudlow echoed        President Donald Trump's statements that the        administration will walk away if an eventual deal isn't good for the U.S.,        but said the economic-growth potential of an agreement could be        "terrific." Kudlow spoke following the release of the November jobs        data, which showed a much stronger-than-expected 266,000 positions added        in the month. "America is working," said the National        Economic Council director. U.S.        stocks .|2019-12-06 09:09:03

9tsxse|e6xdf4|e6xdf4|8|Let me drop some PTON DD for you retards so you don't lose your shirts during the company's next earnings report.   Most of you flip burgers at MCD and can only afford waaaay OTM FD options on your $500 RH account. Probably the same clueless retards who yell "recession"every day.   I'll give you a quick glimpse of how people with disposable income spend $$$ on fitness and health.  My wife and her friends used to go to SoulCycle classes multiple times per week. A single 45-minute class costs $30 per person. Since I was shelling out the money for the classes, I told her I'm going to a class as well to see WTF is going on there. A herd of people (all smell like money) waiting outside of the classroom waiting for the previous group to finish. After they were done, I go in and see about 50 bikes in the room. By the time I was strapped to my seat, the class was packed and they had to turn down more people who were trying to get in. I killed the workout, went home, and told my wife that we're getting a PTON instead.  Last Christmas, I bought 2 PTON bikes (around $2400 each). One for riding and browsing WSB. The other to throw my dirty clothes on. My wife hasn't been to SoulCycle since. Her friends haven't gone back either.   SoulCycle is losing their costumers to PTON so now they announced that they'll build and sell at home stationary bikes as well.   I know you peasants think that PTON is a scam. You probably think that a Lamborghini is a scam too. But nobody cares what you closed minded fucks think. You'll never be able to afford either one anyway.  *This message was sent from my Peloton bike*|2019-12-06 07:13:38

We've had the same routine over the last few days, though clearly where we start the session doesn't necessarily indicate where we'll finish it. Today of course payrolls provide an obvious catalyst to change the narrative, or do they? **At this point you could argue that the only thing that matters for markets, at least in the very near term, is the trade question**.   >   >Obviously today's headline figure will be boosted by the GM workers' return, so in a sense we'll need to average this report with the previous one (however it may be revised) to get a sense of the underlying job growth dynamic. The lousy ADP doesn't exactly provide a lot of comfort, and my model (which does not account for the GM workers) looks for a rise of 102k, implying headline growth of a disappointing 150k.   >   >The year-on-year rise in continuing claims remains positive, which provides fairly compelling ancillary evidence that the engine of employment growth is losing steam, and perhaps not just because the economy is running out of workers. That being said, in an absolute sense continuing claims are really just moving sideways at their lows, which mirrors the experience of mid-2006 through mid-2007 in the previous cycle.   >   >Bond market performance has been less than stellar this week, so if there is a vulnerability to a surprisingly strong number, it may well be there. One survey I saw suggested a broadly symmetrical reaction function to the data, however, so I guess it's probably best not to overthink things.
