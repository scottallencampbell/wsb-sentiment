Yield curve is inverting when we're just 1 0.25 rate hike into the hiking cycle.  Odds we avoid recession when rates go over 2.5% are probably very low and that looks likely by first half of 2023.

Meanwhile over in China: "As of Monday, nine property developers have yet to announce the dates of their FY2021 board meetings, according to Nomura."  They're required to announce by Wed. due to the 7 day board meeting announcement rule and has to happen by 24th at the latest since results have to be released by 3/31.  China real estate is where Japan was in 1990 or the US in 2006.  They may try to prop the bubble up again though so probably have to wait and see.  Every time they prop it up, they make the eventual bust worse/longer.  China real estate prices are flat year over year and account for 70% of Chinese private wealth.  Not many ways to extend this bubble further.|2022-03-22 07:52:30

I get out of the position after I'm suddenly down 30% (protecting myself, you know the BS they tell you) So be it. Of course things stabilize so I say screw it buy another call. Made back the loss plus 1.5X after 2 hours. Of course when I got out of the position it seemed as if TSLA was losing momentum, so whatever but as usual when it comes to my luck   I would be around 8X (yes the moment I'm typing this) if I held. Of course this is the case! If I held all of a sudden huge sell-off. Whenever I say F it, suddenly momentum gone and s#4t stalls!

1oxyj1|tjzhsi|tjzhsi|4|Fed speak is now bullish for the market üôå  Fed's Daly: inflation is too high, and two supply chain shocks are pushing inflation much higher. The major risk I see is inflationary pressures that are higher than we want, need, or anticipated. I don't think we'll be at 2% inflation by end of year. I am concerned that if inflation remains high for an extended period of time, it will 'tug' at the inflation anchor. It's time to eliminate accommodation, marching up to neutral, and determining if we need to go over neutral. The fed could consider tightening to restrictive policy.|2022-03-22 13:22:23

1ot2zu|tjzhsi|tjzhsi|8|*It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era ‚Äî the kind of peak that never comes again. The NASDAQ in the early 2020‚Äôs was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run... but no explanation, no mix of words or memes or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the market. Whatever it meant...*  *There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike 10 baggers anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was profitable, that we were winning...*  *And that, I think, was the handle ‚Äî that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of booms and busts. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our calls would simply PRINT. There was no point in fighting ‚Äî on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave...*  *So now, less than five months later, you can go up on a steep hill in Manhattan and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark ‚Äî that place where QQQ finally broke, and rolled back.*|2022-03-22 12:51:11

1o6nhq|tjzhsi|tjzhsi|2|Ignoring professional investors for a moment, and focusing on retail.  Retail opens the newspaper (website) this morning, checks their social media sources for news on the market. Reads JPow's comments, other fed comments, inverted yields, war on Ukraine escalating, oil going up again, food shortages, EU changing course on more sanctions on energy, China locking down yet more cities and so on. All this massive negative newsflow, and they think this is a good time to buy stocks at near-ATH (single digit drops) prices?  I just don't get it. How is it possible to have such cognitive dissonance.  I understand how big caps can be green because professional investors trade in different ways/goals/whatever.

For instance, the other day in the shower I suddenly realized that I would never consider buying PTON for all the obvious reasons. It was then that I realized that must mean it is destined to go up. By the time I got out of the shower I had convinced myself it was going to be bought by Nike or Lulu within weeks and I needed to buy a large amount. That was a week ago when the stock was like $24. So keep your heads up and buy the stocks that you would never consider touching. The opposite of your instincts are bound to be successful!|2022-03-22 13:38:11
