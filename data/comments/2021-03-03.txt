pj2jf2|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|1|[GME Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwtejk/gme_megathread_for_march_3rd_2021/?sort=new)  [RKT Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwtgh5/rkt_megathread_for_march_3rd_2021)  UWMC was a candidate for a megathread on high premarket volume and mentions, but when I dug into the accounts making those mentions, a lot of them were spam or low effort. We'll keep an eye on it though.  ---  Megathreads have been scheduled for the rest of the week for GME / RKT.  GME will be pinned at 8:30am until 9:00am when it gets replaced by RKT, which stays pinned until 9:15am, when it gets replaced by the rules.  More details on how and when megathreads are collected will be will included there.|2021-03-03 07:06:44

pkz68o|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|7|> The Commerce Department on Friday reported that personal income shot up a seasonally adjusted 10% in January from December, buoyed by the latest round of pandemic-relief payments. Spending rose strongly, too, but with a gain of 2.4% from the prior month, not by nearly as much. And with that, the personal saving rate—or saving as a share of after-tax income—shot to 20.5% from 13.4%. That marks its highest level since May. The only time the saving rate was higher before the pandemic was during World War II.   Things suck now and the market is shit, but I suspect that after the summer ( assuming enough people get vaccinated to reach herd immunity and a complete reopening) we will see a mini-economic boom. The COVID stimulus programs were a huge success, and most people are sitting on much more money than before the pandemic.|2021-03-03 15:42:01

pj7ich|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|11|Bond yield spike still feels too much like 2012-2015 for me.  Markets (and clowns on CNBC) screamed about runaway inflation that never came.  There is still plenty of evidence of a massive output gap that needs to be filled (and the stimulus of the past year will do a great deal to fill it).  But these predictions of interest rate hikes in 2022 (which is why yields are spiking) feels super premature.  There's no reason at all to treat that like a "base case scenario"...  VIX and VXX show little concern with these moves, and until they move there's no reason not to buy dips.|2021-03-03 07:54:44

pjmngz|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|7|hmm, UWMC is in a unique (not saying good, but maybe) spot.  It's currently below price targets, which have an average 11.70 and median 12.00, and that was even after hours (it was at 11.30 when I slept). If we want to listen to the boomers, we might not come out of this red, but it could take a lot of time, and I'm not sure if I want to hold for 12 months...|2021-03-03 09:53:44
pjmvel|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|7|People don’t understand how bonds work and why that affects the markets. Some people are saying why would you invest in something with that little return or doesn’t 10yr bond yields going up mean that people are selling them so more money should be coming into the market. 10yr yields going up means that the investors are selling them but they are switching over to the short term bonds bc they expect interest rates to go up|2021-03-03 09:55:21

pjqoq8|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|64|I'm reposting my original post as the comments are moving fast and I'm seeing people concerned about UWMC 😂😂  Listen guys, don't just buy stocks because it's on WSB, do your own DD (Due Diligence) beforehand. With that being said, if you do your DD on UWMC, you'll see this is a clear winner.   Please refer below:   $UWMC - I truly like this stock.  Quick degenerate outlook. Most recent quarterly earnings had a great earnings report. Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase/growth overall.  Short Interest - Currently I believe its at roughly %50, correct me if I'm wrong. %13.2 as of Feb 12 and an increase of %38.00 as of this week. <---- This is insane.  Fair value analysis  >[Trading at 85.8% below our estimate of its fair value](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings#intrinsic-value)   [Earnings are forecast to grow 4.83% per year](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings#future)   [Earnings grew by 545.9% over the past year](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings#past)  Fair value of UWMC as per Simply Wall Street = $64.40 - Currently going for $10.00.  You look me in the eye right now and tell me you have a hard time seeing this? 👀👀👀  $UWMC 🚀🚀🚀  Mods please make this a serious thread. Thanks.|2021-03-03 10:23:00

pjqkoe|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|6| Rocket Companies shares rose as much as 75% on Tuesday as the mortgage originator became the latest heavily-shorted stock to squeeze short-sellers.   Trading in Rocket (ticker: RKT) stock was halted three times for volatility on Tuesday. Shares closed at $41.60 for a gain of 71.2%. The company is one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, with 39.7% of float shorted.    “Rocket Mortgage-why was 38% of this company sold short?” tweeted Jim Cramer of CNBC’s Mad Money shortly after 2 p.m. on Tuesday. “It’s a really solid company, may not  be your fave if rates soar, but it is so well run!”   [Click here to check the original article:](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/03/rkt-latest-short-squeeze-target/)  [https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/03/rkt-latest-short-squeeze-target/](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/03/rkt-latest-short-squeeze-target/)   &#x200B;  However, the stock is down 16% Today.

pkagdb|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|16|Bullish case on SKT: The bullish case for Tanger Outlets (SKT)  After witnessing the GME explosion, I went looking last week for other stocks with high short %, and ideally low volume.  One in particular stood out to me -- SKT, Tanger Outlets.  [The average volume over the past 3 months is 3.55m](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/key-statistics?p=SKT), and has been slowly building -- the avg volume over the past 10 days is 10.82m, so some scouting and positioning has clearly already been done.    The float for this stock is only 89.64m shares.  That's way less than other recent meme stocks like NOK (5.6 **billion**), BB (508 million), and comparable to AMC (102m).    Given that AMC has a similar float, I then checked out the short % of the float -- for SKT it's **75.26%**.  AMC is 38.12%.  Furthering the case for SKT, [the open interest in puts has been dropping drastically](https://twitter.com/TeresaTrades/status/1354865732748599296/photo/1).  4th largest OI put decrease.  SKT recently reinstated their dividend, and being a dividend/real estate stock, this seems to be one that is safer to hold, and that current holders are less likely to try to exit on a pop.  I live right near one of their outlets, and you wouldn't think we were in a pandemic with all the traffic it has.  Even if malls begin to shutter their stores, outlet stores generally stay open as the stores relocate their inventory to the outlets for clearance, figuring bargain hunters will go scoop them up.  At the start of this year, a new CEO was installed - Stephen Yalof, who previously headed up Simon Property Group (SPG).  He was CEO of SPG starting July 2014, when SPG stock was at 168.19, and hit a high of 227 a few years later.  He ended up departing SPG in April 2020, obviously after the pandemic/crash.  Melvin Capital, as of 9/2020, [was short 1 million shares of SKT](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354162604311261189/photo/1).  This seems like an extremely attractive target for a short squeeze to me and I ended up buying shares and leaps last week, and intend on holding for a while.  The charts the past couple days have been following other meme stocks, but not as drastic -- up 10%, down 8%, etc.  Twice today the stock bounced off the 14.50-15.00 range, and it seems like the [AH orders showed that as well](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_279693951.png)  There's certainly some resistance at $20, but given the low volume and high % of float, OI put interest dropping sharply, I think it's a matter of time before this one hits the radar of more traders looking for the next thing.  Good risk/reward play.|2021-03-03 12:43:33

pizy8q|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|12|Always look for similar stocks that can follow the "market leader to the moon".  They don't have to be a perfect comparison, but often one will show up.  I spend most of my time here posting on what I think will be the next runner after something takes off.  My big mega post on NIO for example followed TSLA's monster breakout in September.  I was talking about AMC a ton (though it was under $1 billion market cap lol) when GME started taking off.  Yesterday, I spent most of my time focused on UWMC as RKT was taking off.  Always look for the "next one"; it will get some interest as the first runner goes, and then it will typically explode later on.  You run a much lower risk of "buying the top" if you buy the next one.  You also get much cheaper leveraged plays.  Yes, you might miss the big move if it doesn't move, but just look at the evidence.  Every single major breakout in these sectors typically has followers; just focus on finding the next one.|2021-03-03 06:38:00

Without this DD there is no reason to expect shorts are wrong on all these random ass stocks like SKT|2021-03-03 11:57:14

pjjji9|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|23|$UWMC - I truly like this stock.  Quick degenerate outlook. Most recent quarterly earnings had a great earnings report. Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase/growth overall.  Short Interest - Currently I believe its at roughly %50, correct me if I'm wrong. %13.2 as of Feb 12 and an increase of %38.00 as of this week. <---- This is insane.  Fair value analysis  >[Trading at 85.8% below our estimate of its fair value](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings#intrinsic-value)   >   >[Earnings are forecast to grow 4.83% per year](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings#future)   >   >[Earnings grew by 545.9% over the past year](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings#past)  Fair value of UWMC as per Simply Wall Street = $64.40 -  Currently going for $10.00.

pj268l|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|15|RKT at 38 or 39 is still a great value play. Rembemer, and this are facts, RKT is not a fary tail, they make profits. They are #1 in the mortgage bussiness, they didn't write sub prime mortgage in 2008 (incredible if you think about it). They have lots of interesting parallel business, RKT Home, RKT Auto, Lendesk (faster grower in mortgage in canada), Amrock, Nexys.   Since Cathy can put whatever valuation to TSLA for reasons like "mkt hasn't price in ride sharing", "Elon is buying shit coin", blah blah blah. I'm going to come up with my own valuation: RKT Homes = Z (39 Billions) RKT Auto = CVNA (54 Billions), Nexys = DOCU (44 Billions). So my ARK valuation is 187 Billions so 1,700 per share!|2021-03-03 07:02:49

pizj50|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|7|Anyone else here just scanning through trying to tease out what the next pump will be? I predict it emerging during trading hours today then a psych up period right before markets close allowing the ticker to pump up through the night and early morning. After that point the stock will pump on Thursday when comments will reach what I call "critical mass" and begin dumping in AH Thursday, continuing in to Friday morning. Time frames may be a little off, but that's been the general trend I see with each of these anomalies.  Note: I don't recommend buying in to them, I just find it fun to try and predict.|2021-03-03 06:33:05

If we see it bounce hard off the $40 mark like we did briefly last week I think we could consolidate around these levels for a bit before heading up. If we break it (which I feel is more likely) we’re going to touch 38. That is our Last support for a while. IF we break that we will find support closer to 30. The good news is if you can time the bottom, you are in for a wild ride back up. Good luck 🥰|2021-03-03 13:07:48

pkkzz0|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|3|My current strategy is to make multiple bets constituting between 5% and 10% of my total account value, some being strictly overnight plays and others being monthly holds. Keep at least 50% of my account in cash and use my 3 weekly day trades to YOLO into hype plays in the morning, looking for easy plays or dip buys that can make me 10% in 15ish minutes and exiting quickly if it doesn't go my way.  Started with $1k on 2/8. Made a $5k deposit last week.

piysvv|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|10|After RKT and UWMC, next one in that industry is probably IVR.  Obviously very different from the mortgage originators, but was an REIT trading at $15-17 pre-pandemic and got slashed down to $2-3 range.  Finally started to see volume buys past month and reached $4.  Can be an interesting runner when it starts to catch volume as I think it would.  Gamma squeeze could easily take it to $7-9 due to how cheap options are on it if/when they get bought en masse.  Most importantly, it's a top 100 owned RH stock and was a meme stock for a bit last year when it went from $2-3 to $7-8 in a few days.  Previous meme stocks typically have more meme breakouts down the road.  Very possible to see another big move out of that at some point this year.|2021-03-03 06:24:24

So the news yesterday of them being near the top of the preliminary list to get added to the Russell’s 1000 and 3000 indexes wasn’t a catalyst finally? You’re telling me a company that is posting BILLIONS in profits every QUARTER was fairly valued under $10 a share last week? Not to mention their 10%  quarterly dividends lmao.

I have to say that all of this pressure by $GME bagholders to push wsb for stickies and flooding the sub with nonsensical posts is getting frustrating.  Post some real DD, not conspiracy theories about HFs screwing you over because you're holding $400+ shares!  All of the hate towards $RKT is ridiculous - that's the whole point of this damn sub!  There was solid DD posted and it would take a few minutes to confirm the information that was presented.  To discredit real DD with conspiracy theories is nonsense and makes this forum more of a target for those saying that all wsb is doing is artificially pumping up $GME.  🚀  🚀  $RKT to the moon!  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  $GME to the moon!  🚀  🚀  If you are butthurt because you're holding bags, post your losses and then get back on the horse.|2021-03-03 07:20:44

pkizyi|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|9|TL;DR- How to deal with anxiety from stocks?  Tips?     I am a first time investor here today, I've missed out on a bunch of tendies because of cold feet, most recently when GME went up to 180 from 40ish (feb 24th, coulda made 4x) and also ABNB's ipo last fall (3x) + Musk's "Use Signal" tweet (to the literal fucking moon).  Each of these times I could have pulled the trigger but I was afraid to.     Today I went all in and YOLO'd most of my savings on UWMC (mostly trading on the margin, pretty much betting the farm) at around $11.30.  My life savings is just money I've saved over the past year, so I didn't think it would be a huge deal, I'm used to being relatively broke.  I completely underestimated the mental toll it would take on me.     I'm down $3k-4k today, I didn't sleep last night thinking about getting up to buy the stock at 7 am.  All day I have had the runs, no appetite, feel like I might puke, and can't concentrate on anything.  I don't really care too much about the money, it's just money, I know I'll be happy either way, but the uncertainty (and lack of ability to control it) is tearing me apart inside. I'm almost ready to just yeet the stock and say fuck it.  I know it's got good prospects and in a week or two I'm almost guaranteed to at least break even, but the stress/anxiety is fucking horrendous.     Call me whatever you want, but help a brother out.  What are some ways that you deal with stock anxiety?|2021-03-03 13:45:03

pk10up|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|7|I mean, the chasers (I'm looking at you UWMC, RKT, GME) are fucking themselves, but in a broader market perspective, it's really starting to look like the hedge funds strategy to beat the era of instant information is to simply lean their chipstack in to try and get retail to leave the market and never come back.  Some of this price action the last couple of weeks just defies any semblance of logic.  Companies like $NVDA should be sitting at 600 right now.  There's zero reason why $BE (the most interesting story in the energy space, IMO) goes from 42 to 27 in 2 weeks.  Texas has a once-in-a-generation snowstorm and all of a sudden all the solar plays are dead?  Commodity semis literally can't make their product fast enough and they get hammered.

I believe we are about to see the largest industry boom of the last 50 years to fuel the past years tech boom. We need materials to create the innovation speculation we saw this past year.   The good news is we are in an era where automation and ai will aid in production and overhead costs. I think these factors will have strong results for the economy much like we saw with the record breaking production of vaccines.   We are opening up, and hungry for opportunity. Be patient, covid showed where society was the weakest and the importance of why we need to innovate now more than ever if we are going to succeed.

One way or another, I think the floor on the price is $30 as the value proposition becomes very strong then, so as the paper hands are shook out the shorts are going to realize they need to cover and then this thing goes up.

pj01sb|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|6|I am not buying the whole reopening play theme. Most of the reopening play companies have been laden with debt, facilitated by dirt cheap borrowing rates. Now if the yields were to rise, their borrowing costs goes up. This would be fine, if the global economy comes roaring back and consumer spending goes up. If the consumer spending goes up (which seems to be the narrative because of high savings rate), these debt laden companies earn enough profits to pay off the interest on their debt. But then again, rising yields would also mean borrowing in general is not as cheap as it is now, so less consumer spending? Somewhere in the yield curve, there is an ideal point but nobody seems to know what that is - not even the Fed.  Paradoxically, the safest companies in this environment or rising yield is big tech since they have huge cash positions. But rising yield means their future cash flow is discounted at a greater rate, making them unattractive. The assumption here is their earnings down increase above what wall street expects them to.  We are looking at a situation which is really very uncertain. Equities have been rallying all these years because of the TINA trade, that is in simple terms - there is no alternative of equities to earn a decent return. But if yield rise high enough, the fixed income bond market starts becoming attractive. So TINA trade goes out the window and equities will finally have competition in bonds.  I have been bullish on equities so far but these hard facts are making me question my position. Maybe this is a turnaround. I don't know. I am inclined to go cash gang than to become a bear.|2021-03-03 06:39:07

pkhs4t|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|8|I was skeptical about $UWMC so I did some actual fucking DD. I know, what kind of a fucking loser does DD, but that is beside the point. Point is that this is a classic wrongful short. This is a good company that is attacked by shorts. It's easy for the shorts to sell the story that a mortgage company is going down because the rates are about to skyrocket. Well the numbers don't lie. Mortgages and refis are still going like hotcakes. The shorts are wrong and IMHO $UWMC it worth more than it is trading for. Even if it doesn't squeeze. But I'm just an idiot that has a degree is Social Sciences because I couldn't pass the foreign language requirements for the the degree I wanted. So don't listen to me.

pj8mc7|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|4|tl;dr: 300%+ upside potential, low cost of entry for retail, currently on sale trading in the $3-4 range \~ Transocean ($RIG)  \+Earnings are trending up - potentially positive EPS this year is not impossible and would blow out all expectations.   \+Transocean has newly patented HALO GUARD technology and will install it on multiple rigs; they have already tested the technology on one Gulf of Mexico rig with a proven positive impact on their operations.  >As evidence of our dedication to innovation, we recently announced our patented Halo Guard technology's successful deployment on the Gulf of Mexico's Deepwater Conqueror. Halo Guard works through a combination of locating device technologies worn by personnel on the drill floor and a machine vision system using leading-edge techniques and machine learning and perception.   >   >As a crew member moves around the drill floor, the technology locates, tracks and alerts the individual to equipment moving in their area and can halt moving equipment, further enhancing the safety of our crew members and overall operations.   >   >The ability for drilling equipment to identify and respond without human prompting is something we have not seen before. We are pleased to provide our crews with additional tools and resources to complement our industry-leading training and safety programs.   >   >This technology adds a layer of protection for our crews, and we believe other industry participants and potentially other industries will also want to consider incorporating this technology into their operations going forward. We are currently planning to install this technology on six additional floaters this year.  \+Transocean has plenty of cash and a backlog of contracts to keep them sustainable well into the future.   \+Oil prices still have plenty of room to run up with reopening plans - stimulus checks and vaccines are coming.   \+The Biden administration is unlikely to be approving new pipelines that could have offset the increased demand.   \+Very undervalued compared to historical, currently market correcting with plenty of room on the upside.  \+The reorganization of debt triggered hedge funds to push them into default. There was a court proceeding that dragged on, and the stock went down to $0.65 but eventually ruled favorably for Transocean.  \+HF was likely long the debt, short the stock, and had CDS if they could win the lawsuit.  \+The downward pressure from the shorting coupled with the lawsuit held the stock low.  \+RIG won the suit, and they were not in default.  \+Bankruptcy was priced in for $RIG; it fell as low as $0.65 from $7-14, but the market was wrong, and Bankruptcy is no longer in the forecast as they have stabilized cash flow and have reorganized their debt, pushing it out over a longer time horizon.   \+HF may be trying to appeal the suit.  \+Transocean is THE LARGEST offshore drilling rig contractor in the world.  \+Transocean has a favorable deepwater rig count and a lack of competitors.  \+Transocean is currently delivering its best overall operational performance in its history.  \+2020 recordable incident rate was 0.24, the 2nd lowest in the history of the company, with 0 lost time incidents  \+Currently delivering 97% uptime on its global fleet, which is the highest in their history, on their most challenging fleet of floaters (ultra-deepwater and harsh environment)  \+Handling of COVID-19 was phenomenal - seamlessly transitioned teams into remote  \+Backlog is @ 7.8B, which will be converted to revenue and ultimately cash  \+New contracts are being secured in Norway starting in Q2 through EOY.  \+Other contracts in Norway extended through EOY.  \+UK contracts extended through Q3.  \+Gulf of Mexico contract with BHP option executed as an increased day rate of $215,000/day, extended through the summer.  \+Asgard (their most advanced asset) recently completed its campaign and is being bid for multiple opportunities.  \+Trinidad contract with Shell extended by one well.  \+New Trinidad contract with BHP signed for $220,000-250,000/day, ending August with Options into Fall.  \+Brazil contracts options executed for 680-day and 815-day extensions; rigs will be working through Summer 2023.  \+Indian contract option exercised for 7 wells through Q4 2022.  \+Petronas in Malaysia terminated a contract for Deepwater Nautilus in November 2020, initially set for March 2021. Litigation will likely rule in favor of Transocean.  \+Deepwater Nautilus signed a new contract that starts operations in March.  \+Expected day rates to rise YoY, with High 200ks expected soon and scaling up each year. More substantial earnings than expected are likely.  \+Reflation trade will likely push the price upwards a few dollars|2021-03-03 08:04:32

Plus options trading just started up on it so heavy buying of otm options can cause a gamma squeeze. Its also being heavily targetted by shorts  So it is the quintessential WSB stock.

GNUS “I like the stock” GNUS is the Kartoon Channel(free app)  I think it has potential to grow substantially and besides GME is where I am invested “heavily”.  Stan Lee super hero kids is due to premiere and will likely drive the stock up significantly.  The board members are all former 80s cartoon/ toy marketing gurus, so I see the plan to grow.  Do some research of your own.  Think it is a great buy $1.65 or less.  The next Disney?!?!?!? $20-$100 share potential?!?!?!?  I hope so! I like the stock!|2021-03-03 08:27:09

pjl2pv|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|2|Great article on Ford's new Mach-E;   0944 ET - Ford's new Mustang Mach-E electric SUV stole US market share from [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=24812378) in February, according to a tally by Morgan Stanley. Ford says it sold 3,739 Mach-Es in its first full month on sale. Morgan Stanley says Ford's sales accounted for nearly all of [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=24812378)'s large market-share decline in February, to 69%, from 81%. EVs still account for only a 2.6% of total US sales, up from 1.8% y-o-y. They surged 34% in February, vs. a 5% decline for the broader market. (mike.colias@wsj.com; u/MikeColias)|2021-03-03 09:42:12

Not to mention they have partnerships with FedEx, Coca Cola, Verizon and oh ya NYC.... they also just announced a 1000 unit charging station at UBS arena.. also highly shorted cause I know you idiots love that. And yes it’s an EV so automatic EV pump should kick in when everyone hears about it. Volume has been up significantly over the last 8 trading days and big money has bought in.

pkklvb|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|6|I am trying to get better at analyzing companies fundamentals by practicing. Give me feedback!! Here it is very basic one for Sun Run (ticker: RUN).  Company market cap: $11 bill  Total paying costumers: over 500,000  New costumers added in the last Q of 2020: about 25,000  Total assets for 2020: $14.2 bill, page 8, see table  Total liabilities for 202: $7.1 bill, page 8. see table  Revenue in the last Q of 2020: $320 mill, for a total of $920 mill for 2020. See Page 9 table  Operating expenses in the last Q of 2020: $500 mill, for a total of $1.3 bill for 2020  Total solar energy capacity at this time: 3.9 Gigawatts.  Percentage of homes in the US with solar systems: 3%  Conclusions: This company has strong fundamentals and is operating in an emerging market that has plenty of room to grow with only 3% of households having solar systems. At this time, they are spending a lot of money to acquire new costumers but they expect this to decrease over time as they gain more brand recognition, supplies get cheaper, and they fine tune this process. Additionally, as the cost of using fossil fuels continues to rise and the cost of manufacturing panels and batteries decrease, more and more households will make the switch. Additionally, there is growing public awareness of climate change and increasing efforts by our government to combat these climate changes. All of this resulting in an incredible opportunity for a company such as Sun Run (RUN).  Source: I read this 16-page document published by SunRun and tried to distill the most important info for you. But I have attached it for you.

pj8fsm|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|5|All-in-all not a bad day yesterday for AMC given how everything seemed to give back from Monday's gains.  There is no doubt this stock is going to explode with mask mandates starting to be lifted, NYC having 13 AMC theaters opening in two days and the fact the Disney CEO is dead wrong thinking people will pay $30-$50 on top of their Disney+ subscriptions to stream first-run movies at home.  People did that during the height of the pandemic because they were forced to stay at home.  People are sick and tired of sheltering in place. All you have to do is ask yourself if you are sick of all the regulations.  People will flock to get out and spend money. Dinner and a movie. Getting the kids out of the house to see a movie and of course teenagers who love getting out to the movies.  There is no doubt we can get this stock flying. Obviously this is not financial advice but hell if each of us added 10 shares of AMC to our portfolios we could all have a lot of fun with this and make good money.  Just my humble opinion.|2021-03-03 08:02:55

pjn6l8|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|4|AMC adapt for the future! Due to extensive real estate in prime locations, AMAZON could make deal with AMC theaters to be a distribution center.  AMC converts 1 movie theater at each location, into a warehouse for pickup and delivery.  Also, they can get better deal with movie distrubution from prime library.  The action created by being a distribution center would also improve traffic for movie business.  Also, provide more jobs. Many thanks AMC management and all APES who support AMC. M🌚🌚N.  Power of M.

pjzuej|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|5|Hey Autists, so came across this article that says we should buy the NIO DIP:  " NIO’s (Ticker: NIO) Q4 earnings were disappointing — and (most) investors were disappointed.  The Chinese electric-vehicle maker’s stock sold off by 13% Tuesday, one day after NIO delivered a tiny sales “beat” — but lost twice as much money as analysts had bargained for.  However, analysts seem to be optimistic about NIO. Data shows out of 10 analysts, 7 are bullish and 3 are sidelined. With a consensus price target of $68.33, the potential upside is about 54%.  "  [Check the original article by clicking  here:](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/03/nio-stock-is-a-buy-right-now/)  [https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/03/nio-stock-is-a-buy-right-now/](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/03/nio-stock-is-a-buy-right-now/)   54% upside prise target by analysts seems crazy for me.

pjnji6|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|3|SKT short squeeze today!!  A month ago I read this and it made complete sense to me. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7g8a0/the\_bullish\_case\_for\_tanger\_outlets\_skt/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7g8a0/the_bullish_case_for_tanger_outlets_skt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  After a spike in price at the end of January, the short interest in SKT increased and became an even better candidate for a short squeeze. So I set an alert and limit buy order for 600 SKT @$17.00 because I figured thats where the shorts would've set their stop losses. Today it crossed that level and volatility went crazy.

If even the low end of those analysts is right, I'll be very happy. Just going to sit and hold and wait. I might not make 2000% returns, but I feel reasonably safe and think the return would be really nice.  Wishing everyone well in all of their stocks and stonks, was just sharing thoughts, I'm not an analyst and no ties to anyone anywhere with special info.  Have a blessed day!  \~Ali\~|2021-03-03 07:56:59

pjj3ks|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|4|My Tesla Bear thesis only gets stronger by the day.  It’s hilarious Tesla has pumped this morning on a Elon Tweet. Meanwhile they keep taking Ls.  They don’t even make the best selling EV in China anymore. GM does.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-joint-ventures-4500-ev-061332516.html  Full Tesla bear case: why the stock is dropping and will continue to drop.  Why is burry short? Perhaps because he realizes all of this:  Software: Waymos CEO who originally produced the self driving software for Tesla criticized Elon last month for being a pretender and not knowing how to achieve real self driving. Elon’s response? “We have better AI & more money” oh really? Waymo is literally spun off of Googles X labs. Lol they have Google behind them.  https://observer.com/2021/01/waymo-ceo-tesla-elon-musk-debate-self-driving-software/  Timeline: Tesla has been said to be years ahead of everyone but they aren’t ahead on software. So are they ahead on timelines? Nope.  The Ford F-150 has already been slated for 2022 to compete with the cybertruck (only 80k version of cybertruck will be available next year)  https://www.hotcars.com/f150-electric-ford-when-to-expect/  And the Ford Mach-E is getting rave reviews and being recommended to buy by everyone over any model Tesla.  Motortrend calling out Tesla’s cheap interiors and their underperformance vs Ford.  https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e/2021/ford-mustang-mach-e-interior-vs-tesla-model-y-interior/  Edmunds recommending the Mach E as the superior car over the model Y:  https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/michigan/articles/2021-01-27/edmunds-2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-vs-2020-tesla-model-y  There are more examples, but by all accounts the Mach E is getting rave reviews and being recommended over Tesla consistently. This wasn’t ever supposed to happen.  Battery: Tesla cannot hit its EPA estimates and continues to vastly underperform the benchmarks it’s supposed to hit. Huge scandal.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/more-questions-surface-over-teslas-ev-ranges-51613091751  Quality: I already outlined that Tesla has quality with its interiors, but is it a wide spread problem? Yes.  China is growing increasingly frustrated with complaints from users over Tesla quality: never mind that China Tesla’s are supposed to be the highest quality versions of the car.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928  Tesla is now ranked last by JD power in quality:  https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302804/tesla-ranks-last-on-influential-jd-power-quality-survey  Ranked worst car maker for reliability and build.  Elon admitting it last week:  https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/business/elon-musk-tesla-quality-problems/index.html  The future: no, Tesla will not have industry leading cars, autonomous software, quality or capacity. Yes every single legacy auto maker has accelerated their timeline and is DELIVERING.  It’s hilarious how a shit post on Twitter that’s a blatant half lie & something hes said is coming for years could provide a dead cat bounce. Oh Elon, what a nice pump. Ill give you credit there.|2021-03-03 09:27:28

But what are your thoughts on GSAT? I’ve kinda been having an obsession over it these last few days, especially after the news of 5G, and feel that it has long term potential. -especially when Nokia came out with their news on it.

It was all fun and games until one of the shady guys tried to show off this fancy rifle that blew up half the palace and made me startle awake. And the guy from Brink didn't even try to kiss me in a shack on the beach. What a waste.

pj2l8t|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|0|Well the hedgies have done a great job of fomenting a following to try and break the gme focus.  Notice how quickly our megathread got pulled (reminder we are still up 164% on the week).  While I'm not saying this thread shouldn't focus on sweet sweet gains on other tickers (that is what this place is all about after all), we should realize that breaking the mega threads is a win for them.  I didn't like the RKT thread in the GME mega, but at least it pulled the people together.  When we lose our cohesiveness in battle is when the enemy has the best opportunity to strike.  While I will admit I'm a new account, I see the DD and I make my own opinions.  I recommend you all do the same with all the buzz flying around other tickers and if we can jump on the hedgies pump and dumps while they try and shift focus from the real play then so be it.

piyare|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|0|Current holdings on GME - 5@116.xx (buying more once holds clear)   The reason for this post is because I’m currently developing a series of portraits of the highest bag holders on WSB. (As well as key imagery pertaining to the moment of time were living in)  Who’s to say what could happen in the next couple months. I feel it would be a great loss to humanity if we weren’t keeping a personal and conceptual record on whats happening in our current situation.    I also thought it would be fun to paint future owners of the company and have them hang diamond hands in the board rooms at GME (long stretch)  The most important part for me to take out of this is record such a valuable historic event that ppl would be talking about for the next decades to come. Im not trying to profit off this i just want to create art.|2021-03-03 06:18:11

pjl52u|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|1|Michaels companies rose 22% on Wednesday after funds managed by Apollo Global Management agreed to acquire the arts and crafts retailer for $ 3.3 billion.  Apollo will launch take-over bid to acquire all of Michaels' outstanding shares at a price of $ 22.00 per share in cash after a 25-day shopping period, during which Michaels may solicit bids from other buyers potentially interested.  Michaels is the largest arts and craft supplies retailer in North America. Michaels' stock has climbed 2,100% since hitting $ 1.00 per share amid the COVID-19 pandemic last year.  The proposed deal places Michaels a stock value of $ 3.3 billion, but the total transaction is worth $ 5.0 billion including the debt that Apollo will assume with the takeover.  &#x200B;  Michaels shares traded slightly above the offer price, with a high of $ 22.30 on Wednesday after the announced deal, suggesting investors believe another bidder could potentially step in to offer the detailing a better deal.  “The company's impressive growth transformation, including our financial and operational performance in the unprecedented pandemic environment, has led to an unsolicited offer to buy the company,” said James Quella, chairman of the Michaels Board of Directors.  The deal was approved by Michaels' board of directors.  Insider markets|2021-03-03 09:42:41

pjq5zm|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|0|I have been a shareholder in Thomson Reuters for about 15 years.  In that time, it has risen by 14 times - so fantastic for a well established company.  For those who don't follow it, TR is a content provider for high end users, such as the Financial Industry, Law Firms, medical, etc.  They are also a major producer of news content globally.  They have recently announced profits above expectations, but more importantly, they have announced a shift in their business structure.  They appear to be prepared to launch their own platform for distributing new and information.  It appears if they are attempting to look more like an IT company.  They already have a Market Value that is nearly 8 times revenue - so the other thing is that they may be looking to use they large content - to enter the retail market - and have major impact on revenue.  I am now thinking of selling the stock - but with this announcement  - with a public presentation to investors on March 16, I am wondering if the company still has legs?|2021-03-03 10:19:16

pixx9g|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|-12|UWMC. I don’t see the play for a squeeze. SI not high/tons of outstanding shares/plenty of borrow/no special div. If the premise is that they are in same biz as RKT it’s bad play. HFS trying to open up another front to divert the RKT troops who have them surrounded!!! Don’t fall for it. Sell UWMC here or at open and buy RKT!!!|2021-03-03 06:13:28

pjyftg|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|-3|ATTN: I know I'm low effort I'm never on here plz help me change that.  Hey guys I am looking for some advice, I am somewhat of trading newbie.  I started on stash and Robin hood somewhere around 2 years ago.  Never have much money to invest as I'm paycheck to paycheck with a family to feed so I left stash..  I typically have anywhere from 500 to $1000 to play with.   Looking at my purchases since I started on Robin hood if I were holding everything today that I had purchased over 2 yrs id have like 1000% growth on my portfolio due to wkhs tesla and other EVs.   I joined up here during the game stop craze but it looks like I must have got booted, idk why I never lost and barely use reddit...but I want to change that, and I want to turn my money into a fatter stack.   I noticed when trying to find the group again today with what's going on with mortgage stocks that there are now multiple Wall Street bets, assuming because there was an influx of people to this one.   Where does a guy like me belong? I just gotta promotions on probably going to have more money to play with this year and I am not an absolute idiot so I don't know that I belong in the light group but maybe I do? If someone could let me know I'd appreciate it.|2021-03-03 11:17:53

pk9xtb|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|-6|HERES THE WORD THEY PUTTIN OUT ABOUT $AMC   12:30p ET 3/3/2021 - Zacks Analysts Estimate AMC Entertainment (AMC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for Mentioned:	AMC The market expects AMC Entertainment (AMC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2020. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.  The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 10, 2021, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.  While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.  Zacks Consensus Estimate  This movie theater operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $3.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1068.6%.  Revenues are expected to be $181.47 million, down 87.5% from the year-ago quarter.  Estimate Revisions Trend  The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.  Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.  Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise    Earnings Whisper  Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).  The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.  Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.  A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.  Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).  How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AMC Entertainment?  For AMC Entertainment, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.  On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.  So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AMC Entertainment will beat the consensus EPS estimate.  Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?  While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.  For the last reported quarter, it was expected that AMC Entertainment would post a loss of $4.66 per share when it actually produced a loss of $5.70, delivering a surprise of -22.32%.  Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.  Bottom Line  An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.  That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.  AMC Entertainment doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

pjbal4|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|1|Fidelity vs. TD Ameritrade     Fidelity transfers from bank account take hours or days to show up and be useable in account.   TD Ameritrade is less than a minute.     I tried to transfer $4k into fidelity this morning.  It's taken 2+ hours (I am on the phone with them now to cancel it so I can use the funds in TDAmeritrade) and in the mean time UWMC went up 15%.  Their system seems old and outdated, it took 15 minutes for a confirmation text to get through, they want you to enter your password on your phone using the number pad when you call them.       I opened TD Ameritrade this morning to trade UWMC, got in at lower prices because of their sweet thinkofswim live trading on my computer's browser.  Fidelity only has a bloated program download that's not compatible with my OS.     I am getting out of fidelity as soon as I sell this stock.  WeBull looks promising too as they have trading at 4 am (every other brokerage I've found starts at 7 am).|2021-03-03 08:27:13

pkrst7|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|-22|No offense to you retards but you should be using charts outside your broker.   Looking at my charts yesterday, I could easily tell today was red. So easy that y’all getting ‘this’ surprised is making me excited because it tells me my charts work and it feels like I’m trading futures, from the future and I’m at least a day in front of y’all 80%+ of the time.   My charts also said UWMC was going to dip from opening price. And I mentioned it in PM in the sub. I read “UWMC buy before $10”. I checked my charts, said hell nah! Almost bought puts AFTER today’s dip.    Right now, I’m not buying SPY because i predict that it’ll either dip lower AH/PM making calls on sale at open. Or, the price will stay the same AH/PM and I’ll just buy in at open on the theta-discount|2021-03-03 14:48:48

pk1quj|lwr7oo|lwr7oo|-6| I am new here (joined in the middle of the GME zootopia) and am curious if someone can tell me how this page works?  Is it just a page where 10's of thousands of people give their opinions and 2 cents every day or is there a spot where a couple of the genius's behind this page let us know what the next plan of attack is (before the stonk has soared) and we follow their instructions?  Since I joined around the peak of GME I have read through so many posts and it just seems to be a cluster f$ck of mixed opinions. During GME spike everyone said Friday was the day of the squeeze and thats when the rocket will soar. Well when Friday rolled around and it did'nt happen everyone started saying it will be the next week instead. Alot of people saying to buy when it was at $350+ per share and I seen alot of new comers buying it at that price. Just doesnt make sense to buy high unless others were looking to sell their shares at $350+.  So is it just hundreds of posts every minute from random people or is there a section that contains a couple posts from the OG's saying what the next plan of attack is?|2021-03-03 11:41:21
