uw3wl3|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|430|The year is 2035. I wake up at 7:30 for the morning scan, and sign into Amazon mechanical turk for work. At 8:30pm I get awarded my bezo bucks, and immediately spend half on stuff from Amazon to stay in consumer compliance. The delivery drone vaults the package into my window which explodes shattered glass all over my living room. Alexa automatically orders me a new Amazon window, my bezo bucks balance goes negative and my account is marked delinquent. Immediately an AWS Certified community spending officer breaks into my home and repossesses all my whole foods groceries, I try to beg for a payment delay but he beats me with a stainless steel 24" Amazon Editor's Choice™ enforcement baton while apologizing and telling me he has kids to feed. Before he leaves he makes sure I rate him 5 stars. I hobble over to my Amazon Fire TV to watch the evening broadcast. AMZN has hit a new ATH of 15,000, triggering a patriot parade. Blue Origin has completed the terraforming the moon into a massive Amazon warehouse.  When the broadcast ends I log into Amazon prime to watch the required ads for an hour then wait a few minutes until I'm approved to go to sleep.|2020-06-15 06:22:16

uxj0h0|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|15|OK I see a lot of retards here that don't really understand whats happening. The FED making this announcement signals (just like when they lowered interest rates the first week of the first crash) that they think a crash may happen this time too. However, with bonds so expensive they know that if a crash materialises much of the liquidity will be drained not only from equities but also from bonds. As bear JPOW said last week (remember retards?) they don't want liquidity to drain from bonds as this may cause trouble even for solvent companies to refinance their debt. This message by the FED is pretty much a "if things go wrong please go into bonds, we got your back". Also it means that they expect deflation which is a BAD signal, they want to keep rates low without having to control yields.|2020-06-15 14:05:06

They continue to say no huge bubble being created yet they keep doing things that have never been done.  Why are they needed?  They are the ones making a huge bubble.  This may run up for a year, 2 years, 3 years but when it busts, people’s retirements will be devastated.  They will lose it all.  The Feds are concerned with the short term while not giving a fuck about any consequences.

uxjvx8|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|24|The year is 2058. For 38 years, SPY has vacillated between 290 and 310. As you stare off into the distance, you feel a tug at your sleeve. It's your grandson. "Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy.

Yan Wang, chief emerging-market and China strategist at Alpine Macro, did the tally for China’s purchases of American soybeans, wheat and other products this year: It confirms the consensus that China is likely to play defense in dealing with the U.S.,rather than being a provocateur. **That means the risk of the trade war restarting is relatively low, at least for the time being.**|2020-06-15 13:42:03

Two, it shields against what we know are about to be the worst earnings reports that history has ever seen coming up.  The fed announcing life support on a market that doesn’t appear to by dying isn’t bullish, bros.  They know something.|2020-06-15 13:46:20

ux2fl1|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|5|Must-read for any HTZ owners:  “Hertz Global Holdings Inc. warned prospective new stock investors they’re all but certain to be wiped out as the car renter proceeds with an improbable share sale in the midst of its bankruptcy.  Equity holders will not see a recovery from any bankruptcy plan unless those with more senior claims, including bondholders, are paid in full, Hertz said as it offered as much as $500 million of common stock. That would require “a significant and rapid and currently unanticipated improvement in business conditions,” the company said.  Hertz has a lot of debt to repay before equity holders will see any money. Its bonds alone are about $2.3 billion underwater, and that amount doesn’t even include what is owed to the banks and any lease payments, interest or depreciation that the courts could make the company return to owners of securities backed by its rental cars.”  HTZ is literally telling you that you will lose your money. I know speculating on drastic upticks on a bankrupt business was fun for some of you new investors, but time to be serious. Don’t overstay your welcome- bankruptcy is bankruptcy.|2020-06-15 11:56:59

uw4gse|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|4|There are three phases to this thing. Phase 1 was the initial reaction (shutdown, economy grinds to a halt). Phase 2 is the reopening. This is where we are now. The most beaten businesses (travel and leisure) start to see some nominal increase in demand, but still way off from regular operations. Within that phase you’re going to have run-ups followed by retracing. Nobody—NOGODDAMNBODY—knows what DAL or MGM should trade at here. It’s all guesswork and it can go very wrong very fast. Not until Phase 3 (back to regular hiring/spending/demand) do we have any idea what the right valuation is. So everyone should have expected sell-offs and rallies during this part. The only real question is how long we’re in Phase 2.|2020-06-15 06:30:33

uwj3li|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|4|Bears: there are likely to be no more circuit breakers because of the fed's involvement. Buy puts on anything $320+ for a conservative play, $310+ if your risk tolerance is higher. Once it drops, take your profits and buy calls. Rinse repeat. If you want bigger gains hit individual tickers with high P/E. Specifically those that are close to ATH precovid when they have no business being there. We're going to need overwhelmed hospitals to get bigger red days, I think it will happen but could take weeks. Would also make moves on IWM as P/E there is ridiculous|2020-06-15 09:19:14

uw8lls|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|14|#It's your boy chimpu and here is my take as people demanded on PM   1)VIX is still on down trend compared to previous months peak   2) 300 is a huge resistance for spy, and when I say huge I am not exaggerating, billions of sell order at spy 300  3)spy is unlikely to go below 290 in short term cause the algo are set up to buy spy on 290 - 295 range   4)put - call ratio suggests that majority retailers are short on this market   5) Hedge funds are starting to build their portfolio with profit taking time to time   6)Algos have gained majority of control in past 2 months, which likely suggests that directions picked in 1st hour end up getting follow through   It's your boy chimpu and will be back with more updates   #Spy Pre-market (297.85) −6.36 (2.09%)   :)|2020-06-15 07:26:48

There’s a table rigged to always come up black! You’re gonna be rich!” You smile and nod.  As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. “You’re in luck buddy! There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.  You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.  “Red” you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.  You see the confused expression on Big Jay’s face as he spins the wheel. “Black” he calls with a sigh.  “This game is fucking rigged!” you shout|2020-06-15 10:25:00

You can't hold it for any extended period of time.. but you also can't buy it when shit hits the fan because that shit is already priced in by the overnight session (which of course you can't buy during).|2020-06-15 06:13:44

ux8cvt|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|3|Best DD you’ll hear today for 0DTE — if Trump late by more than 20mins, heavy bearish.  If on time or before 20 mins, bullish.  If the presser has a nothing burger like when he made us wait 60min to announce churches can open and then walked off, very bearish.  You have to be the judge of that (ie. ranting about sexual rights)  Good luck.  EDIT: IfTrump doesn’t even attend and it’s just the hot blonde, market usually loves her so bullish. 🥰|2020-06-15 12:42:47

LMAO, please take a look at Texas and Florida before saying EU is shit.  I live in Europe.  We follow the rules, they are very strict. Get on a bus or a train without a mouth mask, 100 euro penalty, do it again 400 euro penalty. Throw a party with a lot of people with no social distance, you have a criminal record on your history and also a huge penalty. Movements on the border is very strict. Governments advising no holiday this year.  Test & trace system is in place already. There was a new outbreak in a school a few weeks ago, school got immediately shut down, the whole area as well. Tests took in place for those who live nearby to that area and people who lived in that area went to lockdown mode again. This is how we are doing it in Europe.

I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to J Pow. I called him a cunt. He hits me and sends me to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed, really cold. I feel something warm... It's J Pow! I was so happy. He whispers in my ear "Brrrrrrrrr." He grabs me with his printer hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my ass cheeks for J Pow. He penetrates my Gay bear butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for J Pow. I can feel my puts tearing and eyes watering. I want to please J Pow. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his QE. My dad walks in. J Pow looks him straight in the eye and says, "Spy 350 6/19" J Pow leaves through my window. J Pow is love.

There’s a table rigged to always come up black! You’re gonna be rich!” You smile and nod.  As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. “You’re in luck buddy! There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.  You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.  “Red” you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.  You see the confused expression on Big Jay’s face as he spins the wheel. “Black” he calls with a sigh.  “This game is fucking rigged!” you shout|2020-06-15 08:53:55

Premarket is real time, the two do not have to match|2020-06-15 08:28:36

uwwh9g|h9dhxy|h9dhxy|1|Hypothetical question (actually hypothetical, not something id ever be dumb enough to do or think about doing, but it intrigued me when I had an accidental reversal last week and TD and Fidelity had no real answers)  &#x200B;  Let's say Joe has no money in his trading account, but a fine financial history with his institution. Joe is 100% certain due to supreme knowledge that Stock XYZ is going to pop tomorrow for 10%.  Joe is so confident that he "transfers" 100k worth of funds that he knows aren't going to clear, and is approved on the transfer for 200k including margin.  &#x200B;  Joe sent the transfer Monday, buys the stock Monday, and like he predicted it goes up 10% on Tuesday.  Joe now has 20k in money earned in addition to the "fake" transfer.  On Wednesday the fake transfer of the settled funds doesn't clear.  &#x200B;  Aside from a free ride restriction and the reversal fee, what happens to the 20k Joe made?  Does he just leave the bank with the 20k he gained sketchily, or will those profits be taken back by the bank even though his only technical exposure is the return of the 100k and the NSF fee.  (I swear to god this is hypothetical.  Also, im aware Joe would be financially ruined if his prediction was wrong, but that's not the scenario we're describing here)|2020-06-15 11:09:17

It's kind of like an iron condor but instead of having two in the money credit spreads, you have two out of the money credit spreads. The key is to have enough credit to where if one of the credit spreads busts, you will make a profit from the other becoming in the money. You make money as long as the price changes enough in either direction. Is there a name for this strategy? It's like an inverse iron condor but you make money from volatility rather than the price staying the same but when I looked up inverse iron condor it was something different I think.|2020-06-15 11:51:28

In an interview on the discovery, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said "We feel confident that the months long search for the unifying financial theory is finally paying off. We've invested trillions of dollars in this effort so far, yet the potential returns over the next decade are hard to imagine. Some believe the invention of P/E ratios with imaginary numbers will lead to CAGRs over 100%. Not only is this possible, but I believe likely to happen by 2021. Science is telling us that we can do phenomenal things if we put our minds and our resources to it."|2020-06-15 12:48:23

Some haven't paid since 2019. I used to pay a fucking girl to do this for me, what the fuck was she doing?  I'm about to make Robinhood deposits directly from my business bank account.
