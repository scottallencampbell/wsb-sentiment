Guns are currently sold before the store even gets their shipment.   So how do you make money off of this? Smith & Wesson stock (**SWBI**). Earnings is tomorrow. Last earnings the stock nearly doubled in price (~$19 > $35) after a monstrous quarter. Momentum has certainly increased since. We don't live in ordinary times. Half the country seems to think that the US is on the verge of collapse due to COVID, inflation, housing bubble, etc. This is why guns sales are absolutely bonkers.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!  Around 10 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!  SPY adjusts to the economy all the time, it always follows the profits.     #$SPY 600c DEC 15 2023  *Buy the dip. Secure your retirement guaranteed by Jerome Powell*|2021-08-31 13:28:30

The grass here is brown AF and I live in Canada. Canadian grass was supposed to be green always.  So we \[edit: me and a friend who like to gamble\] thought about the **Carbon Credits/Offsets** thing. Those things will continue to be more and more in demand. I don't know what they are (are they NFTs?) but I believe demand will go up because what self-loving corporation wants to cut their emissions or production? Btw, did you know recycling is a scam and was invented by Big Oil to make us feel better about buying 437lbs of Tupperware PER  year?  Anyway, **Carbon Offsets Futures?** I don't know how to do that. I only know how to buy PLTR high and sell low, as you guys taught me. But I found an ETF called **KRBN but i**t has options! So we can do leaps on this thing!

It looked good so I bought a call with about three and a half weeks of theta. Technically, that wasn't a bad play. The chart looked good. But moving averages aren't everything. I didn't even actually realize that Zoom was about to have an earnings report haha. Honestly ARKK isn't even down that bad and I've still got a few weeks for the trade to play out favorably but it was a nice lesson   If the moving average looks good, maybe check about when the next earnings report is as well.|2021-08-31 10:04:52

b320bn|pf2ra8|pf2ra8|-4|Are most of you bulls aware we are on the precipice of a historically massive, epic market crash and are just playing the euphoria up until the bubble bursts (to be fair bubbles are massive money making opportunities)? Or do some of you actually think we're fine and the market won't crash for years and no bubble exists? I talked to some of my friends and am realizing how ignorant some of them are. By almost every fundamental metric we are historically massively overpriced. Some of these metrics are even at all time highs (worse than dot com, crash of 87, etc.). I've never seen a more ridiculous market in my life...even though I'm too young to have paid attention during the financial crisis or dot com bubble, this is some absolutely obscene stuff happening in our markets right now  &#x200B;  Edit: Oh lord, it's worse than I thought.

b3fcvk|pf2ra8|pf2ra8|-6|we're never gonna have another GME moment because you morons have the attention span and memory of a bat. Someone posted about CRSR a month ago but it just sorta fizzled out because the stock kept sliding. A week ago everyone was hyping CLOV but as soon as GME did something we forgot it existed and now everyones back to stroking it to CRSR because it went up 10% even though it's fundamentally no different than it was a month ago and it's already dropping again lol. The only way we can succeed is if we channel our pure monkeybrain power of will and bleeding wallets into one stock for longer than a few days and stick to it.  edit: the fact that people are accusing me of trying to manipulate in the **daily discussion thread** when I didn't even mention any of my positions or try to convince people to buy a specific stock is hilarious.|2021-08-31 14:27:59

The play is pretty straightforward.  Fed's response to inflation is going to lag behind, that's just the nature of the beast.  Just like they were caught flat-footed this year like crazy, the inflationary effects don't stop immediately.  Malinvestment, excessive planning for growth, 3.5T stimulus etc. will all be inflationary.  People will think that because the market reacts quickly to tapering and rate hikes, inflation will too.

b2pc5h|pf2ra8|pf2ra8|1|Ok, so, who is in ASAN for earnings tomorrow?  With Moskovitz buying up millions of shares between last earnings and tomorrow's, I think we could be in for a ride.  It has dropped today, so I bought calls.  I don't know if it matters, but the liquidity is super low so I think that's why it dropped a bit today ahead of earnings.  With the low liquidity, it is easy to see it really flying if earnings beat.  TEAM is over 7x the market cap than ASAN.  I think ASAN could catch up with the need for more work from home tools as well as the buying that Moskovitz has been doing.|2021-08-31 11:29:00
