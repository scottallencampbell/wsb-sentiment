cqkx1p|jwdx2r|jwdx2r|5|In case you aren't watching Henrik Fisker talk about Fisker, the way they're structuring the company is much like Apple, Apple designs the phones, operating system, etc and Foxconn manufactures it. This means that Fisker itself doesn't need to worry about scaling up production and is relying on an existing, established car manufacturer to produce the Ocean SUV meaning there won't be the same issue Tesla ran into when trying to meet demand.  FSR is a great long term play|2020-11-18 11:34:04

My gut told me this was bull$h*t so I loaded up on XLE leaps which are paying off well now.  A similar thing is happening with BABA now. Wsb is telling me Xi is crushing BABA to teach Ma a lesson so I should avoid. Sounds like a buying opportunity to me 🤷‍♂️|2020-11-18 11:37:44

My wife is an absolutely cold blooded reptile with ice in her veins.  I told her about my $460 Tesla calls yesterday and was freaking the fuck out and wanted to bail when it hit $440s.  She slapped me across the face and said what the fuck did I buy that for if you're gonna be a bitch and bail so quickly. Thank God I listened to her. Now ITM and profitable vs would have taken a 60% loss if I bailed early.  Her position is basically put a play down  and expect to lose it all. Dont abandon early. Ever. If you can't handle it, then don't open up the trade in the first place.  Total black widow.|2020-11-18 10:42:18

Stimulus probably won't even get passed until Feb, or not at all if the Senate is split after the GA runoffs.   Tons of businesses might go under with winter coming (e.g. outdoor dining impossible in many parts of the country) and all protections for evictions come off at the end of December.  There could be a tidal wave of commercial real estate that goes belly up, which will fuck a lot of banks and set off a chain reaction.  Of course the FED will probably step up again, but COVID is completely out of control and there is a ton of risk for real estate.|2020-11-18 08:00:17

cqswbj|jwdx2r|jwdx2r|1|If you can’t afford TSLA options, just buy a spread. You buy an OTM call and sell a different one for the same date at a higher strike.   Basically reduces the cost of entry but puts a cap on the max gains. The max gain is the difference between your strikes.   Buy one spread so you have some skin in the game and don’t FOMO|2020-11-18 12:36:14
