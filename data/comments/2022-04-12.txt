The process:  1) Memestock gets P&D'ed and spammed on WSB  2) Watch as stock goes up +40%.  3) Buy in at ATH expecting +100% tomorrow.  4) Watch as stock drops 30% from ATH the next day.  5) Go on Google and search for articles that confirm the company is a) undervalued b) a hidden gem c) a great recovery play d) a long term play  6) Go back on WSB and bring the good news to all like-minded individuals  7) Quietly sell off your position at -45%.  8) Repeat Step 1.|2021-06-11 13:51:24

1eq618|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|27|Alright quick chat DD because apparently people are spooked here about CLNE: 1. Every analyst projects CLNE to be higher than it is. While the consensus is around the 20‚Äôs some say as high as 40. 2. Large gamma squeeze play happening, if it closes about $13 on 6/18 an enormous amount of shares are bought  3. Great company overall, IE not a bag, constantly focusing on growth and gaining all kinds of new contracts. 4. Amazon is contracted with them at ~$13. Amazon is not in the business of losing money. 5. Two down days after a monster rally is nothing. If that is enough to chase you out, i genuinely don‚Äôt understand how you have any money left. 6. CLNE getting more mainstream interest from Cramer, social media, etc.|2021-06-11 09:49:58

1f5fzw|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|8|No doubt that this will get buried but... MOMO.  I said it when MOMO was $13.50, $13.75, and $14.00.  It is now $15.80.  This stock should be $25 to $35 per share.  This is not a meme stock that is going to "squeeze" and it is not going "to the moon."  It is a stock with a lot of cash on hand and significant year-over-year growth that is consistently beating earnings.  It has paid decent dividends and institutional ownership is on the rise.  The best part?  MOMO offers a very solid product: sex.  For those who are not familiar with the company, it is basically the Chinese version of Tinder, Bumble, and Grindr all wrapped into one.  **MOMO has over 110,000,000 active monthly users**.  That is over one-quarter of the total population of the United States.  In short, people like fucking and are willing to pay for it.  Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.

1fpsds|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|17|I ranted earlier... but CLNE is the future power for long haul trucking. If you think EV will take over long haul trucks, then run a test: take your cell phone and go on two multi hour flights without a power cable or a battery pack and watch videos. Catch is, during the layover, don‚Äôt recharge your phone. You confident that you‚Äôll have enough juice to order an Uber or Lyft? We both know that answer. Long haul freight needs realistic fuel options. Thats why I‚Äôm betting on RNG and CLNE.|2021-06-11 14:09:48

1eeg4y|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|26|The SEC is watching this place like a hawk, and we still have newbs in here saying dumb shit like 'if we band together we can short squeeze X!' This is incredibly stupid, because if there is a coincidental run on one of these companies, suddenly the SEC has to determine if anything nefarious is going on. Quit insisting people do the one thing that could get us more scrutiny.   **If you have a personal opinion about a company, and think others should follow your lead, then lead the way. Post your DD and POSITIONS. If it's a good play others will follow without the need to 'band together' or 'work together'.**|2021-06-11 08:18:37

1f6wfo|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|6|GOEV NEWS -  is this good news or Canoo's demise??  Ulrich Kranz former CEO of Canoo is hired by Apple‚Äôs Project Titan now. Kranz still advises Canoo‚Äôs strategy and IP. This is big. $AAPL might buyout $GOEV at high valuation or partner with us for the use of IP.   Krause and Kranz founded Canoo. Their roles were CEO and CTO. Krause left for personal reasons, Kranz temporarily filled his role until a new CEO could be found. That was Tony.    Kranz resigned (all accounts make is seem like he left in good terms)    And quickly gets hired by apple. (Less than a month)    Almost seems like this was planned. Kranz still has a huge personal financial stake in canoo (.06% of shares) as well as several close associates that he worked with for years (Kim)    Logical would say Kranz has a lot more to lose than gain by sabotaging Canoo.    Correlation does not imply causation so we can‚Äôt say anything for certain at this point.    All things aside if Apple chose the guy who developed Canoo‚Äôs tech then this company has to be legit.  Ulriz still owns more than a million shares $GOEV  What is going on here? Why would AAPL pay $100 for GOEV when they can buy it for $9.50?  I have been watching CNBC this morning. They will mention APPLE hiring Kranz every 1 1/2 hrs and they mention that he is from BMW but they have not mentioned CANOO. I find that interesting. You would think that a financial news network, might find the CANOO exit interesting. But no mention. So strange.|2021-06-11 11:51:45

1eb540|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|20|$WISH is shaping up to deliver some tendies. Available shorts were down another 2m yesterday; the short fee borrow rate jumped to over 8% (from 3%) during yesterday‚Äôs session and it was one of the few meme stonks to end yesterday in the money.   Overnight trading saw the stock price continue to rise, day to day volume is increasing and ContextLogic/Wish continues to be one of the most widely discussed meme stonks on social media, suggesting retail interest is strong.   Looking at the company themselves, they have taken steps to improve their PR, product offering and offer shoppers more features to help them navigate the site. That said, Wish is an online version of the local Dollar Store. It‚Äôs never going to be slick, just cheap. Biden‚Äôs push for rural internet; rising inflation and rising interest rates are going to increase interest in Wish in the same way that economic downturns drive people to the bargain stores in town.   Will Wish moon? Possibly - watch the short shares data to see if it continues to show signs of imminent launch. Will Wish provide gains long-term? Almost certainly, especially if management focus on delivering a better customer service experience.   Not financial advice. Just the random thunks of a retarded ape.|2021-06-11 07:49:06

The pre-denial trading norms were in the mid $50s and it is trading at $12-$13 today.   The drug still has a solid chance at approval by the FDA, as it will go against the advisory board, and even if it does not there are still other drugs in the works by CCXI.

Yes ‚Äúinvesting,‚Äù options, meme stocks, etc. has gained popularity over the last few years, and it‚Äôs easy to want to fomo into the next money making opportunity, but before taking extreme risks that could have you losing your savings or cash, do your own, extensive research, too.  Take time to understand what you‚Äôre actually doing, realize that this isn‚Äôt a get rich quick scheme, and that you‚Äôll probably lose more than you win, especially jumping into whichever new meme stock every other day.   Have a plan, understand the fundamentals, know your own risk tolerance, and be smart.   tl;dr - understand what you‚Äôre doing, do your research, and realize that this isn‚Äôt just some fun game.|2021-06-11 11:31:53

1eb225|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|7|BUY $CLF - DD RESUME UPWARD TODAY after Institutional Long Holders Pairing Off Against Retail  $CLF Not performing on the day with the most chatter the whole day. Post a 14% run up, it's prudent for some of the long institutional people to sell some of their position. They were pairing off against retail buyer flow with a sell program running today keeping the stock tampered the whole day. If chatter continues and WSB community keeps putting buying pressure, we'll see another run up and then that's when the shorts come into play and will start having to cover. The volume yesterday was solid and the price held thus confirming price discovery at this level. They've got their position tapered and we can start trending back upward today! Also the infrastructure bill very much so helps push this steel. BUY cause $CLF is going to crush today!|2021-06-11 07:48:19

1eemao|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|4|Its mad to me that the likes of WISH do anything when its so brazenly an institutional level P&D. They line their pockets with insane profits then sell and crash the price back down leaving you with shit. Worse, you‚Äôve given then collateral to cover themselves for the puts and shorts they stand to lose out on. And at the same time you have a ticker like CLNE which just needs to get to $13 and hold. Good company, novel tech, great partnerships upcoming. Just under $2 increase in price and if that can be held for the next week there‚Äôs a hell of a lot of share options that will have to be covered. Not saying it will be parabolic, but you can be looking at a sure fire profit on whatever you put in. Sometimes its not about making 60% on an investment in a week, especially if the odds are likely that MM will make off with the cash and leave you holding the bags.|2021-06-11 08:20:05

1ewob9|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|3|All right all you retards listen here. If you're not willing to lose a few thousand here and there then you shouldn't be playing the game. This is a repeat cycle every single week Thursdays and Fridays the stonks drop by in at the dip so on the highest people sell and then repeat the process. This is not the way to make them go up. You got to be a bag holder. You want to see another parabolic like GameStop then hold. Watch for shorts and volume trades and make sure the company that you're actually investing in is either worth something to you or worth something in general. Lastly follow the individuals who are successful. Like Zack Morris on Twitter or roaring Kitty or finwit. But if you aren't willing to lose get out of the game and go to Robinhood penny stocks.|2021-06-11 10:37:52

It not you or I or retail or anybody in America keeping this economy from going under, its the printer.   And the markets know this so expect a rugpull to come out of nowhere. Those yield curve numbers are about as real as your instagram.  Be prepared and ready for that rugpull. Look for a surge in $dxy(us dollar) and or gold as signs of an upcoming dump.

Have a bit of leftover, looking for a cheap meme to throw the excess at.    Trying to come up with the best meme I could, I decided to use the criteria of "that will never actually work" as every time I have said that, I've watched it go to the moon later.  I said it with GME and AMC back this past fall, for example.  The two that elicit the most visceral "won't work" reaction from me are $BB and $NOK.    BB is obvious, of course.  It's a good meme, and they really didn't adapt at all. But NOK holds a special place in my heart for being my first phone, and frankly haven't heard a peep out of them in years. That, and they're cheaper. I haven't seen much about them, though.  So I'm a bit torn on what to do.|2021-06-11 10:18:16

1eiil1|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|1|GOEV - my small brain can not figure out of this is good news for Canoo or it's demise.   $AAPL and $GOEV news and price being suppressed. $GOEV is heavily shorted by the immoral shortsellers with short volume of 30%+  Krause and Kranz founded Canoo. Their roles were CEO and CTO. Krause left for personal reasons, Kranz temporarily filled his role until a new CEO could be found. That was Tony.    Kranz resigned (all accounts make is seem like he left in good terms)    And quickly gets hired by apple. (Less than a month)    Almost seems like this was planned. Kranz still has a huge personal financial stake in canoo (.06% of shares) as well as several close associates that he worked with for years (Kim)    Logical would say Kranz has a lot more to lose than gain by sabotaging Canoo.    Correlation does not imply causation so we can‚Äôt say anything for certain at this point.    All things aside if Apple chose the guy who developed Canoo‚Äôs tech then this company has to be legit.  So many questions - like why was there no NON COMPETE in place....????  Ulrich Kranz, the former CEO of Canoo is hired by Apple‚Äôs Project Titan now. Kranz still advises Canoo‚Äôs strategy and IP. Plus, Kranz still owns more than 0.6 percent of whole Canoo.|2021-06-11 08:51:56

Friday's are usually light days for SDC trades, with options traders trying to push the price around. But the options trade has been very active this week, and bulls are coming back to the table in the final hour to reclaim ground lost.  Keep an eye on the close, as how it closes, it is likely to open. This may be the final day for a sub-$10 trade on SDC. Cheers and have a great weekend. X|2021-06-11 14:33:28

Im not an expert by any means but with Biden in the white-house and with countries all over increasing carbon reduction goals and citizens demanding more action, technologies like the one DynaCERT provide are going to grow in demand before full electrification can be reached.   The stock price is currently at .42CAD with a Market Cap of 158.17 Million so there is lots of room to grow IMO.   Like I said not an Expert but was wondering your take on it!

1dwn0g|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|-7|Ignoring the FUD "media spin", there is no bearish case for RIDE. The 10-k had specific verbiage with negative connotations because of legal requirements to identify potential hypothetical risks (however small the risk).  The company has a tooled plant that has a vehicle production capacity of 600k/yr, crash tested (5 star) on route to being the safest mid size truck ever. ZERO debt. On schedule for mass production next quarter. Exclusive rights  to proprietary hub motors (fewest moving parts of ANY automobile). Fully integrated (chassis, batteries, etc.). Enough components (like microchips) for a full years production. They are hiring hundreds of plant workers as we speak.   The only bad thing is the cash burn.. this is a startup that's gearing up for mass production of vehicles... of course they are going to spend a lot of money.  The retards (aka "dumb money") are being manipulated by the media into thinking this company is going bankrupt... I'm betting my entire life savings that they are NOT going bankrupt.

1ewqrn|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|-5|# It's Hip to Be Square $SQ  I've been experiencing a ton of FOMO recently regarding all the action going on in¬†r/wallstreetbets. So this morning I decided to make my first #wallstreetbet and begin building a position in Square, Inc.  Investment Thesis: As a software developer and startup enthusiast I wanted to target a high growth internet company. However, I ran into serious trouble identifying any high growth internet companies trading at modest valuations. All of the great companies which I wished to invest all seemed to be trading at $40+ billion market capitalizations. At such high valuations, is there really any upside left?  To answer this question I decided to take a trip back in history to look at the most recent "obvious" investment I could think of: Google. What was Google valued at when it went public? What did Google's earnings look like? If one were to time travel back to 2004, what would the fundamentals have looked like? Well, here's the answer... Google was valued every bit as high as today's high flyers. Here's a little snippet from¬†cnn.com¬†regarding Google's financials heading into their IPO:  &#x200B;  >In the filing, Google said that it generated revenues of $961.9 million in 2003 and reported a net profit of $106.5 million. Sales rose 177 percent from a year ago although earnings increased by just 6 percent. Google also revealed that has been profitable since 2001.   >   >For the first quarter of 2004, Google reported sales of $389.6 million, an increase of 118 percent from a year ago. Net income was $64 million, up 148 percent from the first quarter of 2003.   >   >[https://money.cnn.com/2004/04/29/technology/google/](https://money.cnn.com/2004/04/29/technology/google/)  &#x200B;  Square, Inc. is currently earning in the same ballpark as Google back in 2003, so I'm pulling the trigger.  &#x200B;  * Square's 2020 Revenue: $9,497,578,000 * Square's 2020 Net Income: $213,105,000  So that's my plan for 2021-- continue building a position weekly in Square (and also Robinhood after their IPO in July). Anyone else long $SQ?|2021-06-11 10:38:23

I think they have huge potential and based on all the positive news articles I can't understand why shares are still trading lower at $13 especially when it's even got analysts saying it should be $28 and earlier this year it was at $35. I think it's worth $100 but is ahead of it's time so I'm sitting on my shares and have been buying at $35 and all the way down till now. That's how much faith I have in it but I feel like these price drops don't make sense? Anyone else trying to get in in this ride?|2021-06-11 08:48:23

(NKLA)   The short thesis for electric vehicle maker Nikola is understandable. Nikola took a major hit in 2020 when founder and chairman Trevor Milton resigned amid allegations that the company had misled investors. Nikola has spent much of the past year fighting the public perception that the company is a complete fraud. Partnerships with General Motors Co. (GM) and CNH Industrial (CNHI), as well as investments from Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, have helped Nikola regain investor confidence. Nikola shares have roared back to life in the past month, and the stock's recent rally may be just the beginning.  &#x200B;  NKLA ALL DAY!!!  &#x200B;  I cant tell you how sorry you will be....|2021-06-11 09:08:25

1f7iqc|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|-3|Another questions about GOEV - Is there no NON COMPETE and if not, why not??  GOEV NEWS -     Ulrich Kranz former CEO of Canoo is hired by Apple‚Äôs Project Titan now. Kranz still advises Canoo‚Äôs strategy and IP. This is big. $AAPL might buyout $GOEV at high valuation or partner with us for the use of IP.    Krause and Kranz founded Canoo. Their roles were CEO and CTO. Krause left for personal reasons, Kranz temporarily filled his role until a new CEO could be found. That was Tony.    Kranz resigned (all accounts make is seem like he left in good terms)    And quickly gets hired by apple. (Less than a month)    Almost seems like this was planned. Kranz still has a huge personal financial stake in canoo (.06% of shares) as well as several close associates that he worked with for years (Kim)    Logical would say Kranz has a lot more to lose than gain by sabotaging Canoo.    Correlation does not imply causation so we can‚Äôt say anything for certain at this point.    All things aside if Apple chose the guy who developed Canoo‚Äôs tech then this company has to be legit.   Ulriz still owns more than a million shares $GOEV     What is going on here? Why would AAPL pay $100 for GOEV when they can buy it for $9.50?     I have been watching CNBC this morning. They will mention APPLE hiring Kranz every 1 1/2 hrs and they mention that he is from BMW but they have not mentioned CANOO. I find that interesting. You would think that a financial news network, might find the CANOO exit interesting. But no mention. So strange.|2021-06-11 11:56:09

1e4qqj|nxcaz5|nxcaz5|-8|SOFI   Check it out.. Been getting primed all week- Today its ready to run (undervalued even if runs to $40 in next couple of days- compared to other fintech).  **Quick Summary of SoFi (from recent article)** SoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a national bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will allow SOFI to take direct deposits & make loans based on those deposits, rather than acting as a re-seller. Sofi also offers Credit Cards & recently announced it deal to offer auto loans. Also, theres SoFi brokerage, which competes with Robinhood.  Then add to the mix, Galileo, a payments processor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for $1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers banking platform for over 90% of all digital banks in North America.  Over 70% of Top100 Fintechs globally are clients- including Chime and Robinhood. All the deals are similar. SoFi is buying capabilities from small players it can roll into a full-service bank-and-brokerage offering for a national audience, running off a mobile app. The comparison with JPMorgan Chase isn‚Äôt pure hyperbole.  **The Importance of CEO Anthony Noto**          SoFi is the ultimate expression of this change and, in Anthony Noto, it has a leader who can drive that change home.          "It‚Äôs the jockey who matters on a horse like this."   Noto is a former Goldman Sachs banker who helped take Twitter public and served as CEO. He‚Äôs also a former chief financial officer for the National Football League, one reason the SoFi name is on the new Los Angeles Rams stadium.          "If Noto continues to run SoFi, I think it‚Äôs in good hands." He‚Äôs a West Point graduate whose business degrees come from the University of Chicago and Wharton School of Business. He‚Äôs still just 52. He could become his generation‚Äôs Jamie Dimon, who also got to the top after a flurry of deal-making with Citicorp and Bank One. "Forget Chamath. Buy Noto."|2021-06-11 06:44:29

If you have enough time until    expiration, it may be possible to repair the position or "leg out" in    order to hedge your risk exposure. Because of the short window    associated with Weeklys, it may not be possible to manage your risk    effectively in this fashion. Also, you may want to practice-trade    Weeklys first to get a sense of how the implied volatility, Greeks, and other factors may differ from traditional options.   >   >These risks are in addition to those inherent in all options. Before    trading any type of options contract, you should fully understand how    they work and what the risks are.
