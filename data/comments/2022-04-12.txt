Your candle--no matter how bright--can get snuffed out quick. Between two wet fingers, with nothing but a hiss.  We were roofing some old guy's barn, and it was hotter than Hades out. Tar and shingles, tar and shingles. All that bending up and down in the summer heat made you dizzy. At least I guess that's what happened. I'll never know for sure. There wasn't much of a breeze. But next thing I know, my buddy is stumbling backwards. Right off that roof. We were probably 15 feet up in the air. Not much, but enough.  I raced down the ladder, and when I got to him lying on the ground, he looked all peaceful. He was just blinking up at the blue, cloudless sky. I held his hand. I don't really know why, it just seemed like the thing you do in that situation. And then he made one simple sound, and that was it. He was gone. With one gentle, "Guh."|2022-04-12 10:49:22

Your one-year-old baby girl found crayons, and then she found a wall.  “Well, stop her!” You lunge for her and rip the crayon from her meaty paw. “Why would you do that!?”  Suddenly, you’re aware of how loud you are. You look up from the red crayon in your hand and see your wife crying. Baby, confused by the moment, starts to cry, too. Your wife scoops her up and wordlessly retreats to the bedroom.  The RoseArt “Red” crumbles in your clenched fist. As you look at her art project, you start to cry also. There’s something familiar about the jagged, descending line.  Your pocket begins to vibrate.

4f951y|u1vesh|u1vesh|6|There is STILL no alternative, folks. Keep that in mind.   Fed has played this nicely with the .25 hike and waiting another month to even think of reducing their balance sheet. Inflation hit the top without them having to take away the punch bowl. All they did was reduce the alcohol concentration a little bit.   Wouldn’t be surprised if inflation downtrends next month and Fed continues with .25, with only 90 bn off their balance sheet. After that, another downtrend month and the JPow is cracking open another bottle of Everclear to re-spike our punch bowl.   If you’re a bull, may be two months of uncertainty and sideways movement to go before it’s back to melt up. If you’re a bear, start stocking up on firearms, emergency rations, flashlights, etc with whatever tendies you made during this brief downturn.|2022-04-12 08:08:36

4fef1p|u1vesh|u1vesh|10|Here's something for the "forward looking" bulls to chew on.   The last 2 CPI reports were 7.8% and 8.5%. Averaging those out, we are currently on pace for 8.2% y/y inflation. Feds use rates to wrangle inflation and have a target 2% inflation y/y. Their current path *WAS* 7 hikes at 0-25 BP (3.25% annually) meaning they projected CPI to end at 5.25%. We need the next cpi reports to be dramatically lower to hit that target. If we end the year at 7%+ y/y inflation, feds will have to raise rates 2%+ than what was expected in order to hit their 2% target. And the White House basically told Jerome to use whatever is in his power to wrangle inflation. Rising interest rates is absolutely not bullish for growth companies.    So yes, 8.5% was expected. And it is still **jarringly bad**.|2022-04-12 08:47:26

4h4ufy|u1vesh|u1vesh|14|My take? Like you all are asking...The market peaked last year. We are still heading lower; another 15-20% until we have a recession early 2023.   The recession will be minor however, and the next bull market will begin when the signs of the recession is ending. We will not see the 2021 market highs again until late 2023 or early 2024.  Until then invest accordingly|2022-04-12 15:23:58
4f1qpo|u1vesh|u1vesh|18|The CPI is basically a huge amount of actual price data collected via landline surveys and other outdated and regarded methods, and then they take that data and run it through an amazingly complicated math equation of their own creation that allows them to arrive at a lower number than reality. They don't even try to hide that they're doing this. Their data collection methods are all spelled out in a 107 page pdf available to the public.  Using tricks like substitution of goods and "owners equivalent rent", they've been massaging the numbers for decades.  They've also always excluded the price of real estate in all inflation calculations, giving no one in government any incentive to prevent hyperinflation in that area. Therefore encouraging the creation of a landed gentry class.  Unless they want to pay TIPS investors and Social Security retirees a hell of a lot more than they're currently making, the BLS is tasked with telling the hugest lie possible while technically telling no lies.|2022-04-12 07:07:40

4ezna0|u1vesh|u1vesh|6|CarMax dropped a deuce and cited macro factors as a reason for stinking.   Albertsons is drilling now premarket. Albertson'ss writes: Gross margin rate decreased to 28.7% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 28.9% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of fuel, gross margin rate was flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due to productivity initiatives, improved pharmacy margins related to administering COVID-19 vaccines and favorable product mix, offset by lower gross margin rates across certain product categories due to the rate impact of increased product costs, higher supply chain costs and an increase in LIFO expense, all driven by the current inflationary environment.    Game over.  Companies already showing signs that inflation is fucking their margins and earnings growth is slowing.  People are going to preemptively sell off due to fear of getting walloped at the margins and slowing earnings. Inverted yield curve thesis that there is an impending recession is gonna get a major boost this earnings season.|2022-04-12 06:48:24

There is still a ton of shit that will keep prices evelated.  The fact that the Fed is going to unload $100B per month is going to hit market sentiment, and it will eventually sink in that so much shit is just overvalued.  This market would have kept getting drilled if it weren't for the Fed last month. The fed was still laughably expanding its balancesheet.  The gravy train is ending.   The other big threat is decreasing earnings growth during this earnings season. CarMax and Albertsons just blew chunks today citing inflation/macro.  Shitty earnings this week coupled with bad PPI numbers tomorrow will add tons of fears that earnings growth has peaked too.  The insane valuations we have now will no longer be justified now that earnings can't keep up with expectations due to inflationary pressures at the margins.|2022-04-12 10:02:51

4f13t8|u1vesh|u1vesh|8|Old man Joe wants to allow summer gas blends to up ethanol content from 10% to 15%, hoping to saving 10 cents per gallon. Yet, higher ethanol content lowers fuel efficiency, a 5% increase can lead to upwards of a loss of 1mpg.   So, simple math, 20gals @ $5/gal = $100, 20mpg = 400 miles.  10 cents off, 20gals @ $4.90/gal = $98, 1mpg loss, 19mpg = 380 miles.   Loss of 20 miles. $2 saved at pump. Now need 1 more gal to make up lost mileage, so $98 + $4.90:  your total for 400 miles is now up to $102.90.   So basically Joe is a fucking retard. This doesn’t even count for production cost increases, corn cost increases.|2022-04-12 07:01:55

I mean so perfectly between major events or if news is about to be released, the market goes up, but then as it gets closer to the news or event in question, then the market starts going down? Can we just stop with this kangaroo shit.  Another theory that I have is that this shit's being manipulated in order to destroy the wealth that retail investors have earned over the last four to six years. I mean inflation is being driven up partly to to rising wages and more disposable income right, we've seen the largest wage increase in the last couple of decades, I think this is an effort to destroy everybody not in the 1%.

People think bears want you to sell everything you have and fuck your life. The reality is the bears in here are screaming at you to get the fuck out now because regardless if you hold or buy more. The people in control are absolutely about to sell everything and the price of everything will drop. Had you sold now you can buy back in when it is cheaper and have more. That’s what the people in control are about to do. They are about to sell every rip until it tests the “bottom of 430” or what I think is the actual bottom of 400-415. And then the market will climb to all time highs of 500-530 by September. The numbers are all here.

I just checked now and SPY tanked within minutes of that decision. Those puts would be profitable had I not sold. I get the whole paper hands thing, but I bought for a specific event and was expecting to sell about that time regardless.   I would like to say that was an anomaly, but it's not. This happens every time for me without exception. Buy, the stock reverses, sell or expire and the stock reverses again. You could set your clock to it.   Seriously, this has to be the matrix. No one can be that wrong that often, in every possible way. I Seriously am a market mover. It's confirmed.|2022-04-12 14:42:59
