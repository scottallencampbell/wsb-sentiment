Who cares if yesterday he tried to take a hard stance on China, impeachment proceedings started yesterday or he's said this many times before.

1fkva5|d92cz0|d92cz0|11|Autists,  Today was a good day for me. Some context to this post. My portfolio was down about 36% going into today. I‚Äôve slowly lost money after discovering this god forsaken forum.   I bought 200 shares of AMD so I could sell covered calls a while back. I did so, and made about 300$ in premium doing so. I purchased 7 long dated AMD calls yesterday towards the end of the day and I was already bagholding DIS calls after passing up on profit. Long story short, my folio was down about 800$ this morning.   In a rage I closed my covered calls, sold my DIS and AMD calls. I watched the market continue to fall and literally put my entire folio in AMD calls. I made about 1.5k and sold reaaaal quick. Then I bought a 12 9/27 297 SPY calls right before it took off. Cashed out for a nice profit of 40% (600$)   I know this is chump change to some of you autists, but it felt good making a couple risky decisions and having them pay off, wiping alot my losses off the table. (Folio still down 23%)|2019-09-25 16:24:43
1e71vg|d92cz0|d92cz0|15|Buying power is negative $29k. Dumb ass TSLA and AMZN tanked too much and I sold naked puts.  AMZN was as much as ~$1830 last week and now it decides it wants to go down after messing up my naked calls the other week.  At first the $240 call for TSLA I sold was in danger since they were around $248 last week. Figured, I'd sell a $240 put to make it a short straddle for free money. Piece of shit tanks from $248 to $222 in a week. Also sold $235, $230, $225 strikes for other weeks.  Gonna have to close some to bring my account back to positive buying power today.  edit: still positive on both, but it sucks ass when these moves happen.|2019-09-25 07:31:30

1enkxb|d92cz0|d92cz0|7|Listen up retards. A lot of you are surprised of a this small ‚Äúbounce‚Äù. But let me tell you why it‚Äôs not a surprise. Regardless of any news, this isn‚Äôt a surprise. We opened 299.41 yesterday and dropped to a low of 294.33 today. If we drop $5 with very little bounces down the way we need to retrace a little. So jumping to 296 range isn‚Äôt surprising. Long story short, you retards tunnel vision way too hard in the short term that you lose sight of the bigger picture. No asset can just go straight down or straight up; it needs to retrace before going in the general direction it‚Äôs going.

In order to make the DOW go to new highs, he would need to make a China deal OR he could just have Mnuchin conspire to manipulate BA stock price.

1en9n0|d92cz0|d92cz0|0|So if I buy calls I'm betting that a company will increase. But specifically I am buying the right to purchase at the current mkt price IF AND ONLY IF it rises to the pt I call at. So when I sell my calls, it's actually that contract/right someone is buying? Puts is the opposite? Purchasing the right to sell at the current mkt value IF AND ONLY IF it falls to the pt I buy a contract at?  &#x200B;  Why are calls/puts that are super high valuable then? Say a stock is $50 and I buy a call in a month for it to be $65. It's generally unlikely it actually hits that mark but if it rises to $51 my value flies up? Is it riskier to hold these more aggressive calls then, hence why the contract is cheaper to purchase?  &#x200B;  Dummies/Autists only plz|2019-09-25 10:40:40
