[https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US10Y](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US10Y)  If these treasuries keep going down or stay low, that tells you increased demand and low yields.  This only happens in an equity sell off . If price action is positive, a relief rally is present in the stock market.  Watch the US 10 Year treasury, it is a measurement of true investor sentiment, not volatile price action influenced by central banks and money injections.  Think smart and be safe. Short positions could be on sale during this relief rally. Don't chase the magic dragon too much.  Edit: Fixed it to make more sense. I am not fully awake at 3 AM yet.|2020-03-02 05:31:07

That being said, and I don‚Äôt say this because I hate trump or am trying to make a political bullshit post, but trump trying to urge Powell into dumping more money into the markets is really starting to concern me.   > As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act. Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive. The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We don‚Äôt, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. We should be leading, not following!  As per Trump‚Äôs charge, maybe we *should be* leading the world, but not in cutting rates, but actually raising them. I‚Äôm honestly afraid trump either doesn‚Äôt understand true economic policy (hence his incessant urges to the Fed) or simply does not care about healthy economic policy.   I‚Äôll wrap it up, but I think heading down a road of minimum to even negative interest rates is a very bad idea. I hope Powell just steps aside and let‚Äôs the market do its thing.

ja6507|fcaiav|fcaiav|9|First and foremost, fuck robinhood.   Secondly, if you went all cash heading into the weekend this is exactly what we want. Should bounce around 300 area for a while.   Barring another last minute moon like Friday, VIX will lower substantially. A flat Tuesday trading in range would be ideal.    Get ready to load up on puts around Tuesday before close or Wednesday if you'd prefer to play a bit safer.   Hedge with qqq monthly calls or even vix puts because on the chance we don't dump further rest of week, I don't see volatility increasing much. We're not getting back to ath in a week.|2020-03-02 10:39:36

I've gone from wanting to go full mitigation on my SQQQ position with deep ITM call sells to thinking now doing something a bit lighter.  Fed cut HAS to happen sometime this week, but is it happening today? Tomorrow?  Timing aside, the macro landscape feels like we're due for a bounce and then more fall-off. But the timeline is anyone's guess. Accordingly, I'm ready to maintain at least some short position until at least the next selling point. Ideally, I'd like to sell SQQQ before the rate cut, and then buy back in, but I know better than to rely 100% on market timing. If I miss the timing, I'll hold through the bounce. For now, I'll hedge my bets with covered calls.|2020-03-02 06:57:08

j9sve9|fcaiav|fcaiav|16|Guys...how is it so hard to understand that death rates are irrelevant with the virus...it's about supply chain disruption, and lost business. Last week wasn't "pricing in" the virus, it was a long awaited correction triggered by the virus. The real damage to the market is only just starting - when earnings fall across the board, and already fragile industries like retail go tits up, a recession will ensue. Only just a matter of time.  Its not about a virus killing everyone - its about consumer buying and supply chains. Unless this shit mutates - then we are all fucked.|2020-03-02 08:19:19

jadvow|fcaiav|fcaiav|14|Copying my comment regarding RH suits:  If you file in court, they‚Äôll move to dismiss, since the ‚Äúproper‚Äù venue is via a FINRA arbitration.   A bunch of these popping up will cause headaches, but it‚Äôll probably be a copy-paste type motion to dismiss, so it won‚Äôt cost them that much $. Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it‚Äôs all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).  Now, there are jurx that don‚Äôt follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.  The main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You‚Äôd want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you‚Äôll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.|2020-03-02 11:51:27

If it were.1 lower and it would have been a contraction (shrinking production).  US10YR still at yields below 1.1 which is bad. Its lowest on record is 1.03 and were currently at 1.07. The lower the yield, the less attractive stocks look. Plenty of people still rushing to buy even at these all time lows.  Still no signal from the fed about an emergency rate cut meeting. Next scheduled one is 2 weeks away.  SPY still trading below Thursdays close.|2020-03-02 09:17:45

jadp9q|fcaiav|fcaiav|4|If you file in court, they‚Äôll move to dismiss, since the ‚Äúproper‚Äù venue is via a FINRA arbitration.   A bunch of these popping up will cause headaches, but it‚Äôll probably be a copy-paste type motion to dismiss, so it won‚Äôt cost them that much $. Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it‚Äôs all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).  Now, there are jurx that don‚Äôt follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.  The main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You‚Äôd want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you‚Äôll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.|2020-03-02 11:49:46

jabzsm|fcaiav|fcaiav|10|Will post this here as well.  We are dramatically increasing availability of testing kits this week which has been the rate limiting step.  You are going to see a substantial increase in the number of relatively asymptomatic infections who have been out and about in our communities for weeks/months.  This will cause another sharp drop initially to the shock,  followed by a sustained rally as people digest the reality that we have WAY more cases than we  had initially though and very little mortality.  I.e., a lot of this overblown.   Summer will bring a substantial drop in cases just like it does with Influenza and most other respiratory viruses.  At that point, we will have stimulus and economic policies in place which will juice the economy into summer-- this is the window to be really bullish.   Next fall cases will spike again, too many unknowns to speculate at that point.  Source: I am a healthcare provider.|2020-03-02 11:33:17

And that does not look like it's coming.   Also boys, remember, it is not just about the virus. The UK just said a trade deal with the US would have "limited upside".

This is why all the death statistics are all misleading. Like this skews the US statistics so some guy who doesn't understand stats will just report the raw death rate.   In reality the death rate of this virus and flu are the SAME except for the group of people who are old and have immune/respiratory problems. If you take out that group, the death rates are pretty much the same. Only issue is if you are old and have immune/respiratory issues, you pretty much die with this virus.  That accounts for the entire difference in the death rate of these flu vs coronavirus.   If only the stupid media understood statistics there would be less fear and it would actually benefit and help people because we would know to be more careful around this certain group of older/respiratory problems group of people.|2020-03-02 13:27:21

j9tbju|fcaiav|fcaiav|-2|I know most of you 12 year old degenerates don't remember this, but there was a thing called the H1N1 back in 2009, which was WAY worse than the beer virus:  &#x200B;  "From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus."  &#x200B;  the problem is all the boomers glued to their phones these days, everyone is overreacting.  oh, btw, wuhan went back to work today:  &#x200B;  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-toll/chinas-wuhan-closes-coronavirus-hospital-as-officials-hail-drop-in-new-cases-idUSKBN20P01K](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-toll/chinas-wuhan-closes-coronavirus-hospital-as-officials-hail-drop-in-new-cases-idUSKBN20P01K)  &#x200B;  I guess by mid-spring (or even earlier) we'll be back to previous levels.

javt4c|fcaiav|fcaiav|-3|Can someone explain 2 things for me?   1. If this pandemic's mortality rate is higher for the weakest humans in society why isn't that a long term bullish idea? My example the bottom 50% dies right so in order to restock labor you replace from the top 50% of humans becuase they survived. Therefore the new workforce is much more efficient, resilient, etc.   2. If this started in Wuhan and everyone thinks this came from a lab prove to me this wasn't and human engineered population check for China. With previous population policy to control growth, and current easing of the one child policy would result in higher fertility and ling term growth again. Convince me this isn't a way for the Chinese government to control population while removing themselves from ethical and moral repercussions of population checks.
