Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!  Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!  SPY adjusts to the economy constantly and always follows **profits**.    #$SPY 600c DEC 15 2023  100 call leaps purchased on July 21 for $330 each are now at $711 which is $38k profit on leaps! https://i.imgur.com/K4sXt07.png  ***Buy the dip.

We go to a bar after and I buy her a few more drinks - then she takes a call from her friend and suddenly she has to go. Get back home and she’s with her friends at a club (from her stories).

jsm52l|qpb8yh|qpb8yh|23|Bears, your problem is simple.  All the big downward moves happen in premarket, when you can’t buy puts. And when something opens big down, it will definitely get bought up, so buying puts at open doesn’t work.  The only say to make money on puts is to literally know the future at least 24 hours prior, and luck out on the rare occasion that a stock temporarily goes down.   So much easier to get money by just expecting stocks to go up, since that’s what they do.  Anyway, !banbet TSLA 1300 by 11/30.|2021-11-08 06:06:06

jspxpp|qpb8yh|qpb8yh|9|Elon deciding to sell the stocks was actually priced in.  It's Priced in  Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.|2021-11-08 06:46:08

jtxs59|qpb8yh|qpb8yh|2|How does "inflation is transitory" or "inflation is caused by only supply-side issues" make any sense when everyone and their mothers are buying shit left and right, borrowing money for dirt cheap and labor as a whole is in short supply?  The Fed has to be straight lying through their teeth when they say they believe this is all supply-shock inflation.  So some semblance of the inflation we're seeing now is likely being caused by an increase in demand, which in normal circumstances would dictate a rate increase or a decrease in money supply.  But the Fed are too scared to hurt the markets, so we run with near 0% interest rates until it's too fucked up to fix and something self implodes.  #Sounds good!|2021-11-08 12:08:39
