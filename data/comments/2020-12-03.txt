ehaj5a|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|72|Bear King Michael Burry in the ring, slappin TSLA with a metal chair. His glass eye open wide with rage as he batters TSLA relentlessly.  "The valuation..." *crunch* "makes...." *crunch* "NO.... " *crunch* "SENSE!" he roars with maniacal autistic glee.  TSLA struggles for the edge of the ring, but coughs blood as each hit lands, and eventually stops moving. Bear King Burry drops the chair.  *Bear King Burry turns to the crowd*  "Was this your champion!? Was TSLA supposed to be your *chosen one!?*"  *A child in the crowd turns his face into his mother's side and cries.*  On the side of the ring WSB can barely move. TSLA was supposed to tag them in, but couldn't make it to the side in time.  "Get up TSLA" WSB whimpers hopelessly, a single tear rolling down their cheek. "Get up..."  *Bear King Burry turns to WSB*  "Now it is your portfolio's turn. Get in here you little bitch."  "Excuse me." Someone replies from behind BKB. "I believe I can give you the fight you want."  A robed figure is administering smelling salts to TSLA. The figure puts TSLA on its shoulder and carries TSLA gently out of the ring.  "And just who the fuck do you think you are?" BKB rumbles ominously.   BKB's fingers squeeze so tightly on the chair that metal bends.  "Who am I?" the robed figure inquires.  *The robed figure stands straight and stretches to their full height. They must be at least 7' tall.*  The crowd stops crying and watches in stunned silence.  "Who am I?" The figure repeats menacingly.  *The figure turns around to face BKB, ripping off his robe. A gleaming light fills the stadium. Before us stands a Golden deity, rippling with muscle. If there is an ounce of body fat it is currently in hiding, only to make way for seemingly endless coiled golden musculature.*  The figure looks directly into Bear King Burry's eyes.  "I'm Goldman Sachs, and i'm here to kill you."|2020-12-03 06:30:40

Predictive Analytics will define the 2020's.    This is going to be one of those companies like Google, Facebook,  Amazon, and Tesla, where people wish they had heard of it in its early  days before it exploded. The difference being when Google, Facebook, and  Amazon were in their infancy, there was no Robinhood, trading apps on  phones, and WSB full of a million strong discussing companies in live  discussions.

eiry09|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|12|DIS will buy up the empty husks of movie theaters for pennies on the dollar and sell "Disney Experiences" or some shit. When a movie launches you can buy like a $50 family ticket for you and your kids. You go and all the characters will be there in costume and they'll have the whole place decked out in relevant movie decorations. The food will be mediocre but it'll have a special theme related to the movie so it costs $10 for a box of "hulk fries" which are just fries but green. Most adults will probably hate it but they'll have no choice because their kids will beg them to go after Disney advertises it to them on a Youtube Kids video. Then you've always got the "grown" adults who never outgrew their Disney obsession who will drop $150 on a premium experience.   They didn't spend millions of dollars getting the Paramount Consent Decrees repealed for nothin.   tl;dr DIS $200 1/21/2022|2020-12-03 14:07:09

ehyy6m|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|6|I've found that the key to options trading is reaching a point where you have no emotional reaction whatsoever to the numbers on the screen. Most people don't last long enough to reach this point.  You want to reach a point where you can earn $50k in a day without getting happy. Then you can finally approach things with a clear and rational mind. And make a lot of fucking money.|2020-12-03 10:29:08

ei1o0g|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|7|Today's market is all about how investors see the world next year and beyond: Free from Covid (Airlines, restaurants, non-online retailers pump), where competition amongst the world powers creates a new AI and cybersecurity-driven arms race (CRWD, PLTR, SNOW pump), data becomes the new oil (DDOG, SUMO, ASANA pump), and thus EV's replacing gas guzzlers (TSLA) becomes a nail in the coffin for traditional automakers (GM), who are way too late to the electric party.  Today's bearish, but recovering trades (potential dip buying opportunities):   \-Anything to do with China (BABA, BIDU, NIO).    \-Any covid-tech play (ZM, PTON).|2020-12-03 10:50:18

eiq8sc|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|5| Look, I think the GME play is full on retard, but it makes sense in the short term because of the way that some stocks skyrocket on bullshit. GME has earnings Tuesday 12/8 I believe. It will probably have juiced earnings, beat expectations, and the CEO is talking bipolar level manic shit about turning GME into the Amazon of video games whatever the fuck that means. So he'll probably blow a metric shit-ton of smoke of wallstreet's ass. If GME pulls back a little more tomorrow even I might take a flyer on it. But careful of the IV crush. It's not as tasty as orange crush.|2020-12-03 13:56:23

Early September (3 months later) - VIX starts rising, while SPY cranks up, BIG dump a few days later.  Now, we're 3 months on from the Sept. dump, and this week VIX/VXX has started flattening out/rising while SPY is up.   I'm loading up on some VXX calls with 1-2 week out expiration. Also, short dated SPY calls, since the last 2 times this happened, SPY rose for several days with VIX. This could be nothing, but it's something to be aware of.|2020-12-03 09:36:12

eioonp|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|5|The stock market MMs are like the fuckin mafia man. Strong arm everything to get what they want. Supposed to be a free market but they strategize on ways to tilt the rink in their favor   GME has bounced off $16 a dozen times in the last three trading days and its apparent to me that someone has a huge position in covered puts being sold  SDC has had abnormal volume on the $12p for the weekly, which was odd because it was holding a $12 resistance several times too. The stock itself it set up to trend past $13 before 2021. Do buying puts at all looks pretty sketchy, the only way you’d win on that is through manipulation. Yesterday, above avg volume hit on $12p, at open the stock dips to $11.40 (the breakeven for those puts at EOD) and then blasts back to +$12. If those Put holders didn’t sell then, they were fucked, but of course they sold. And if they didn’t sell, they just manipulated the stock into a second chance at breaking even on their puts|2020-12-03 13:46:21

By way of relevant update, by Monday and Wednesday next week, respectively, is the FDA's deadline to approve their 2 newest clinical trials.  Monday is for the most potent anti-COVID antibody on the planet (which is why DARPA last week gave them $34 million to work on it for another project), and Wednesday is for the antibody in nasal drop formulation.  By way of illustrative example, the phase 1 trial for what I just called "the most potent anti-COVID antibody on the planet" literally consists of only 2 people.  This is real.  Want to change the world?  Get your COVID test, get nasal drop antibodies sent to your house the next day, and then get better.  That's the news I'm expecting by Wednesday.|2020-12-03 08:59:35

ehte3d|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|12|   I have a Grinch fetish. My boyfriend knows about this and for the most part accepts it. He isn't crazy about it and doesn't really get it but he at least tries which is all I ask. He'll sometimes read the book to me to set the mood, or if he's really feeling kinky tell me "You're a mean one" in the heat of the moment. He's even begrudgingly come around to at least playing one of the three versions of the film every time we do the deed (although we tend to stay away from the live-action one because it's too much for me).  The thing is, I don't want to hear about the Grinch or listen to the Grinch or watch the Grinch. I want to be fucked by the Grinch. And for the record this is common among women. The Grinch's bulging sack of toys to me (and many others) is what a Mack truck is to Cardi B. The fact that he's good with dogs and experienced trauma at a young age makes me want that long, fuzzy dick even more.  My boyfriend asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I told him straight up. I told him to put on the greenest, silkiest Grinch costume he could find, kidnap me from my bed on Christmas Eve, and then ravage me in front of the Christmas tree.  He flat out refused. Said it was too weird for him. I was literally begging this man to let this pussy save Christmas and he was like nah, I'm good. It ended up turning into a fight where he admitted he only gave into my initial Grinch kinks to placate me and was still uncomfortable about the fact that I had moaned "Grinch" during sex a few weeks ago, but only because his song was playing in the background.  So he's drawn a line. And if I don't drop the Grinch fetish (which as I said is incredibly common among women but sadly taboo) he's done for good. I don't want to lose him over this. But it's really hard for me to see past my sexual proclivities especially during Christmas season. Is there any way we can even compromise on this, or do I simply need a more adventurous man?|2020-12-03 09:44:10

They have lots of tailwinds:  (1) Economy opening back up---they have done well to shift to online sales but their main sales channel still remains brick and mortar stores.   (2) Their new partnership with Target is a stroke of genius! Sephora is now playing catch-up by entering a partnership with Kohl's. Unfortunately for them, Target is simply superior to Kohl's with respect to their target market: upper and middle class, mostly white women.  ULTA+TGT = (Becky energy)^2. Both ULTA and TGT are phenomenally well-run companies, this synergy will be insane.   (3) Pent up demand for make-up and beauty products by all the following (sometimes forgotten by WSB but crucial) demographic: Kaileigh (14-18 yrs), Becky (19-35 yrs), Karen (35-45), and Susan (45-60).  So whats the play? Long-dated call options, if you can afford them. Load up on summer 2021 calls and you'll be handsomely rewarded. Yes, I know this goes against the zeitgeist of WSB but there is a reason why 90% got wiped out by PLTR and NIO. Godspeed and good luck to all.|2020-12-03 09:49:38

The captains suggest a blow off top is under way and we may experience some turbulence.  Please stow all OTM options in the hands of the nearest bag holder on the bid.  Profits should be taken and please stow all hedges in the proper spot adjacent to your seats.  Please put your pending order tables up and fasten your seatbelts.   A brokerage representative will be collecting margin calls later in the flight for those who left positions out.  Thanks for flying the markets with us.|2020-12-03 09:27:15

ehz2fh|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|3|So Friday of last week I bought 600 in PLTR calls due to reddit.  Monday market opens and I'm in the green for a few minutes and then boom it nosedives.  I held until Tuesday and finally said fuck it, sold the call for 200 and bought puts.  Puts go the fuck off and I get 1200 back.  I sold yesterday and then waited until I felt it was going back down and bought more puts.  Got fucked today and sold those puts for 600 and bought more calls only this time expiring at end of January instead of end of week.  So hopefully it can just gain without any research groups giving it shit.|2020-12-03 10:30:03

They have record orders for their products and demand is only increasing with big data, cloud computing, IoT, and 5g. The options chiains are all super well priced with very reasonable IVs.  Buy calls out 3 months and beyond for $90-100 and just watch this thing print. The valuation for AMAT is super reasonable, in fact it is probably too low.  If AMAT starts getting valued at multiples in line with its peers in the semiconductor space, AMAT is a $100 stock. AMAT is a solid company unlike all of this other meme crap and cloud companies that are valued at like 1000x revenues and zero profits.|2020-12-03 11:34:53

eibxyx|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|3|Do people not look at the pet market before investing in CHWY?  Market cap is $30B in a $99B industry. And of that $99B they don’t play in about $30B.   Do you really think Chewy should have a market cap equal to 50% of total market sales?   Also remember you have WMT adding pet prescriptions, Amazon adding prescriptions, and less vets working with Chewy to begin with (won’t do online script fulfillment).   🐻|2020-12-03 12:10:37

eid05o|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|5|AirBnB: Good platform with strong uptake but difficult competitive path due to increasing competition and industry positioning. Losing 300 million in 2019 didn't reduce the hype but imo IPO price grey market is overvalued.  DoorDash: Their platform and business model is clever but also retarded, but they aren't as popular in my country so I wouldnt make a judgement on them but seems overvalued. (The whole parasitic model to get restaurants is fascinating)  RobinHood: Neck yourself if you invest in this one  C3AI: Almost profitable now but their super slow growth rate is sure to accelerate with AI progress. IMO this will be a bigger growth area than EV in the next decade, but its hard to know if this company will be a forerunner or frontrunner. Personally its the only one of these four hyped IPOs I'm going for.|2020-12-03 12:18:56

Michael Burry surpasses Jeff Bezos in wealth after closing his historic short position in $TSLA, which now trades at a price of $20/share on the NYSE.  “It was literally free money and tendies” he told the Wall Street Journal in an exclusive interview.  “I mean, it was quite easy to come to this conclusion. They only sell a few thousand cars each year and can hardly churn a profit. Nothing compared to Toyota or Honda. They’ve got multiple companies competing for market share that are just a better choice as well.”  When Burry was questioned about Elon Musks personal and corporate bankruptcies he replied “Well, we were all trying to warn him. He was delusional thinking Tesla could actually one day make it.”  Elon Musk declined to comment on the story.|2020-12-03 13:19:58

ehdt9k|k5vaj4|k5vaj4|1|I feel like if it passes the house the weed stocks will boom. I think its possible. Dems have the majority and support by Republicans is much stronger than you think. In fact most of the big weed investors are conservatives and historically conservatives want less laws. Being sandwiched between 2 legal countries (Canada and mexico) is going to supremely complicate enforcement. Also half the states its legal in some way. Hell in the town i live in Texas you can hold up to 4 ounces and only get a ticket. Thats a quarter pound! With Trump rumored to do a "u.s. companies can't deal with anyone using slave labor" order I think thats going to complicate the use of the prisoners in the u.s. more than anything which marijuana laws have been used to fill up the prisons. Also Trump has stated he doesn't think it should be federal law, thinks it should be up to the states so he'll most likely push senate to get rid of the law not necessarily endorse pot. Biden on the other hand is extremely against legalization. Lots of private prison, alcohol, lawyer lobbists also in the mix so who knows. I'd say its 50/50 and not the no brainer its going to fail as most here think. Ending the war on drugs will save a lot of money and state and federal taxes will provide a windfall of revenue. I know a lot of people say "yeah right, the weed guy is really going to pay taxes". No the big guys will come in, take it over. You'll be paying taxes on it just like with cigs.|2020-12-03 07:13:26

Like I think I’m a nice guy and I’m uncomfortable with all this and want to set the right mood for my crush. Anyone got a good back up plans instead of a bonfire? Help a bro land his dream girl and I’ll donate my left testical|2020-12-03 06:04:56

I really feel like it would make more sense to put it all into one stock rather than diversify it in terms of how I can actually grow this account.
