jvgiyp|wlnmai|wlnmai|16|1. FOMO late in a ticker that is only going up due to coordinated pump n dumps 2. Ensure you go balls to the walls in calls on that ticker, earliest expiration, highest strike to ensure max risk/max reward 3. Go to WSB and spam like no tomorrow to try n recoup ur losses n get others to hold ur bag, because you're not part of the group that pumped it, so they left you holding the bag 4. Realize you're basically not even gambling, you're just trying to scam people 5.

jwbr9j|wlnmai|wlnmai|13|If you're confused about what happened today, look at the 10y yield then look at the top weighted items in the S&P 500: When the 10y went up, growth began to deleverage and the stock leading that charge was TSLA.   The problem is people used to pile into bonds when the market went down. With the current market, instead people pile into "defensive" technology (like AAPL) and volatile high cap stocks (like TSLA) and the chief mover for these events is TSLA as a result.  If you want a bull market back, bond supply has to drop to bring yield down and that inflow has to be significant to fight QT. Since bonds are losing money with the market now people just aren't doing that, so that pushed yield interest in bonds a little higher which in a soft market is competing in institutions for equity capital inflows. That process is basically algorithmic since each time bond yields drop and institutions buy up risk equities, the need to buy bonds and lock in higher yields increases and vice versa until you get equilibrium.  So you want a bull market, stop buying so much fuckin' TSLA and buy more bonds to help reduce the risk free rate of return.|2022-08-11 14:29:50

And right now? I'd pull the rug.  2 month rally on volume that would have been low any time in the last 5 years, just topped a very key resistance (just like we'd just broke under an absolutely massive lower channel when the rally started) the market seems unstoppable. Seems like nobody wants to sell their stock! Inflation numbers and PCI just came back better than expected. China is not escalating (much) Russia Ukraine war intensity level is slowing. It's the best things have looked all year if you're a normie. And therefore, Wall Street must dump it.|2022-08-11 10:28:38

jun5zu|wlnmai|wlnmai|9|I've said this multiple times over the last several months and I'll say it again:  Inflation \\= price levels. Inflation measures the changes in those price levels. It is the first derivative. If something costs $100 and it goes up to $110, then inflation is 10%. If it goes up again to $115, then it's 4.5%, which is less than half of last inflation reading, even if prices still went up.  The Fed is NOT trying to bring down prices per say, that would be DEFLATION, it is trying to cool down the rate of growth in price levels.|2022-08-11 07:51:09

She'll take you to bed and wordlessly explore the space between you until there is none, until that frontier is fully discovered.  You know that tonight she's buying the top on you, but you don't stop her. You know tomorrow she'll find out what you did with that $27,000 loan you both got for renovating the kitchen. You know tomorrow she'll find out what calls are and then scream in violent confusion about why you'd buy them on Bed Bath & Beyond. She'll pull at her hair, that same beautiful hair that fell across her face, and ask, "You mean that store you hate going to with me?"  "Yes, that one," you'll say.|2022-08-11 14:30:14

juvuab|wlnmai|wlnmai|2|296.311 vs. 296.276. That's the difference between the CPI of June vs. July. People celebrating this as a "decline" in inflation, don't realize that prices have pretty much not dropped at all despite what the 9.1% vs. 8.5% will tell you. The reason for that difference is the year/year figure which takes into account the July increase of 2021. Inflation hasn't slowed for shit. Even with the massive drop in energy we're still flat to last month. Will be another monster number in August and September. Get ready for double digits|2022-08-11 08:57:44

A young professional in Tucson is skipping car payments to afford her higher rent. A researcher in Miami signed the lease for her new apartment sight unseen.   i always thought the wealth gap from 2020-2021 pump was already insane via QE, but this after effect is even more pronounced with inflation/QT.   if you're upper-middle class  (or balling) you're gonna be fine.   **fuel and food:** okay this went up but you're not gonna really notice (cuz you prob drive a premium EV already anyways) and you were already buying pricey shit at premium grocers (eg whole paycheck)  **rent:** isnt an issue for you cuz you have tons of equity in your home that you own or you've already refinance at historic low rates. hell, you're just mulling how much to increase the rent on your rental properties to.  **investments:** market took a beating in 2022 but you're not a WSB degen, its not like you went all in on big tech calls/leaps in Dec 2021 like a certain speaker of the house. hell, she's fine too cuz on the way up in the bull market they leveraged the fuck out of their $ and 3x~7x it.  if you're working/middle class you're absolutely fucked.  **meanwhile joe peasant** is struggling over a less than 1k/month rent in mid-size town America cuz their take home pay is barely $1,500/month. nevermind those that work regular gigs in major metropolitan areas. you're stressing over rent in your small ass fucking space. your car broke down and you dont have the funds to fix it. you can't afford to be late to work but the fucking bus takes forever cuz this city isnt really build for those w/o cars. you're pretty sure your roommate does illegal shit on the side to make ends meet.  **conversely WSB degen** here are throwing six figures into TSLA OTM calls or BBBY calls cuz hur dur hedge funds. you're pretty sure Bed Bath Beyond is a failing business since all the stores you grew up seeing are gone/closed down. but this guy on reddit seems totes sure and he's throwing shit tons of money on it so you put your final rent money into meme stock X after it has ran up 120% in a few days and cross your fingers. shit's gonna be ok, right?|2022-08-11 12:13:57

jvodm6|wlnmai|wlnmai|-2|Being a young adult, I've been huge into index fund investing. I pour my major assets (DCA) into index funds. YouTubers recommend against individual stock picking, and statistics show that 99% of individuals can't outperform the market.   Does this mean that one should never see individual stock picking as a profitable investment strategy?   My current assets are mainly index funds, but I dumped $500 into ETC, and $250 into Carvana. For seasoned investors out there, is it dumb to even think about buying individual stocks? I bought ETC because I'm young and #YOLO, but for Carvana, I figured its historical peaks are so high, and it doubled in the last week. I go by the quote, "Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful." I believe that every stock has a certain momentum, and if you don't see it through fully and sell when you think it's starting to plateau, you take the profits and leave. Obviously, feelings aren't facts etc., but what has people's experience with such investing been?|2022-08-11 12:02:24

I think the production number forecast is because no one wants the damn thing.   Never seen one on the road and I've seen 30 Rivians.  So the car is overpriced, buyers will never get a tax credit, the company bleeding out and have zero cash next year, years away from having any chance at profitability.  It gets longer range only from a heavy battery.  Batteries are in short supply.  Luxury buyers don't need range they take planes.  The company has no cheap EV in the pipeline.  US companies will flood market with cheap EVs.   All i hear is year but Saudis invested.  So what?  They will burn through the 7 billion they have gotten by next year and don't have shit to show for it except the prototype of car that is not competitive in the marketplace.    As Elon said, he had more kids last quarter than the 670 cars this POS company made.  Yet the company is worth $30 billion? WTF am I missing?|2022-08-11 11:50:54
