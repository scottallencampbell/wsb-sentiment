giaimj|q77v1k|q77v1k|33|2 years ago I had $300 in my bank account. I was working minimum wage jobs, lived paycheque by paycheque. Life was hard. To make ends meet, I had to go to a food shelter and get anything they could give. Luckily my city had generous donators and I could live off of some canned beans, without the help of my parents.  Then, I learned about the stock market and the compound gains you could earn from just simply investing.   Today, I have $100 and I am still living paycheque to paycheque.|2021-10-13 12:33:00

There were alot of words, would take me an hour to legit read it and care to understand. There may be something of substance in the one's released today, but I don't expect it to deviate from public statements or sentiment.  We know they are likely to announce taper next month, we know inflation is higher than they'd like. We also know that the markets have pulled away from ATH already, so I don't expect these minutes to move it more than 1% in either direction.   In other words, Berz should hold their 415p for 10/15 in anticipation of the minutes being released and Bullz should hold their 450c and we all get fukt.|2021-10-13 12:01:26

Today is going for a retest of the channel's lower boundary and will be desperately trying to close within it and above the neckline of the IH+S pattern.  If it closes within it, we have an Inverse Head + Shoulders and should see a nice bullish day tomorrow (and probably to close off the week...hell, an end to this pullback?), but if not then the Double Top-ish with yesterday's High should mean we drop into a new channel and the pullback continues.

ghgfp4|q77v1k|q77v1k|1|VOL SPIKE IMMINENT? 4250 A LINE IN THE SAND?  The market broke through the 50 day moving average in September and    since then has failed to break back above it twice. The last 4 monthly    option expiry weeks (May, June, July, August) have been characterized by    a quick 2-3% correction which were subsequently bought. However, the    buy the dip mentality has been replaced by sell the pops. Traders are    quick to sell the rallies and so far the market has corrected about 5%.    There is no conviction in the market at this time. Also have Seasonality    factor:  the market is down historically during this time of year   (September / October). With all the option dealers large Vega exposure,    the  market could experience a Volatility Shock similar to that of Feb    2018 when a Vix ETF blew up. [https://youtube.com/watch?v=IIDbpDywO7w&feature=share](https://youtube.com/watch?v=IIDbpDywO7w&feature=share)    According to Vega exposure data, option dealers have a large exposure    and a volatility spike, with SPX breaking 4250 quickly, -- would cause    them to cover. Remember, volatility increases during option expiry week.    If the market corrects more from here, it would be a great buying    opportunity.|2021-10-13 09:08:56

I originally planned to keep tossing $20 or so at it every week until the hold was lifted, but then dug a little further and realized it would probably be a few months before that happened and so I just laughed my $20 loss off and figured I'd check back in a couple months.

gibl36|q77v1k|q77v1k|-2|Starting next week the weather generally gets cooler, wyell likely still have the delusion things are still improving outside Biden making an unpopular move causing backlash. Heading toward the end of the month concerns will be dissipated and the indexes will hit all time highs, including SPY hitting near or just past $500.  We will then see small dips and sideways charts until realities get revealed by leaks and then public announcements going into Nov, and by mid Nov, or before, the inflation, supply issues, china housing market burst, and a renewed covid surge due to variants and colder weather will all hit at once.  Leading to 5-7 days of major drops as the big three indexes hit or come near double digits.  Issue is the timing. I give time frames but for all I know we will be in the leak stage this Friday, or it could be mid November.   Heck it could be tomorrow, it will be when most people are not prepared, the elites and corrupt individuals already know what's happening, they are just waiting for the right time. They will not be impacted. It will be the unconnected upper class and everyone else that will see their assets come crashing down.|2021-10-13 12:39:48
