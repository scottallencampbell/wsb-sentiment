dghhh9|ela5f8|ela5f8|11|Started the 2020 trading year down five digits from naked calls on AMZN and TSLA and stuff.   Only down about 1.5-2k right now, but the loss might be more than that with AMZN gapping up again (sold another call yesterday at open, which turned out to be a really bad move).  Getting back on track to positive though.  Gonna try to make 1-2k scalping futures today. Yesterday was 1420 net on ES and 414 net on NQ (missed out on a lot for closing early in day), so 1834. Will see how things go. If it doesn't move much, might not be able to scalp that much. So far I scalped 219.50 net on NQ overnight from a small short. Not in a rush to get green right away. It should happen by end of this week unless AMZN and TSLA continue being really lame.|2020-01-07 05:36:34

He has been accused of all but sucking Trump's dick in the past couple years, after he acquiesced to the "cross currents" manufactured by the President. Hell, I think I might have even accused him of sucking Trump's micro pp at some point. So, maybe he is motivated to give a middle finger back by sinking the market with the end of the repo interventions and/or a rate hike this year. If I were him, it would certainly cross my mind 🤔|2020-01-07 11:28:03

dhfryv|ela5f8|ela5f8|3|>**SPY Shorts Disappeared Over the Holidays**   >   >By Michael Regan   >   >(Bloomberg) -- In the perennial debate about how much euphoria is in the U.S. stock market, it's notable that we began the year with **the biggest S&P 500 ETF (ticker** **SPY) having the lowest level of short interest since the final days of the meltup in late 2017/early 2018. That moment preceded a double-dip 10% correction.** (These estimates are from IHS Markit based on positions that are a few days old, so Iran-induced shorts aren't reflected.)It would be foolish to think this alone is a sign of an upcoming correction since short interest also was near these levels for much of 2017, which was a very fine year for equities. Still, it shows you just how low the proverbial wall of worry was as the calendar turned and how short covers can't be counted on as front-line dip buyers should a real sell-off start.   >   >   >   >[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/aei9Prx.png)|2020-01-07 12:28:37

Whats a good country, or region, to try and find a fund for?  &#x200B;  \- Mexico and South America is so inherently tied to the U.S.  \- Southeast Asia seems...super corrupt. I guess \^ that is too, though.  \- India doesn't seem like a place I want to park money  \- Fuck the middle east  \- Africa is rip  &#x200B;  Any suggestions?  &#x200B;  edit: maybe a Japan fund?|2020-01-07 12:36:29
