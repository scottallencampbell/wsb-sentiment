55bb1y|dmvv6a|dmvv6a|2|So this balance area really is tough, we tried escaping it through the ceiling two times this week and got cucked at 3015 area both times, both those sessions started with an open above 3008 so maybe that's the issue here ? The session seems to inevitably go back down to where value is : 2990-3005  Maybe we need a session with a rally trashing that 3008 ceiling instead ? We kinda had that yesterday with the W action but it still closed barely above the range and we're back down into range now at 3007.  Still yesterday we closed above the range which is bullish  With amzn announcing losses and dropping 5% tho it's not looking amazing for ATH today.  We'll see how we close today's session as we go into the weekend. There should be some profit taking if we're above range so if we still close above 3008 i count that as very bullish  Gold & silver edged up during the night, [gold broke out of it's downtrend](https://i.imgur.com/GYr8MsZg.png) while [silver had already broken out and is back to 🚀🚀🚀 mode](https://i.imgur.com/sm7KcdE.png), we'll see if both those gap ups stand in session or not.

55ln7p|dmvv6a|dmvv6a|0|AMZN Trying to take over their own deliveries has felt like a total failure. It's rarely straight forward. I don't want to be bothered by the delivery person, asked to meet them outside, or be told they'll put my package in a bush outside the building (happened to my girlfriend a week ago) and last night I got an alert my package couldn't be delivered, and 30 minutes later got a text saying the delivery person can't get into the building. No consistency at all, it's pretty obnoxious and makes me not want to order from AMZN anymore.|2019-10-25 08:21:37
