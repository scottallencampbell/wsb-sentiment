neu40d|g13jnz|g13jnz|26|I know everyone says bears are delusional and "BRRRRR" and all that, but honestly, this shit is beyond absurd at this point. I'm not even a bear, I just do day trades with whatever the daily trend is. Was a bear yesterday, was a bull today. I'm too scared to hold overnight anymore, and any sort of real analysis tends to fail.  But... SPY is already back at Q4 2019 levels and barreling towards its ATH, and the economy is fucking closed, lol. Even if there is a vaccine tomorrow, it will take a long time for unemployment to recover, and middle-class liquidity will be down for the foreseeable future. The housing market will struggle, etc etc. There's no logical reason the market should be where it is. A vast majority of companies won't see revenues like Q4 2019 for a long, long, LONG time. And most analysts agree that shit was already overbought in q4 2019, anyway.  I'm lucky in that I am better off than many, and I don't have financial concerns about weathering this storm. But even I *know* that my spending, across the board, is going to be cut in half for the foreseeable future. I'm a business owner, and my contracts have dropped to 0. I don't *have* to, but I'll be cutting personal silly purchases, vacations, bars, restaurant spending, etc etc for probably a year or more. I was planning on buying a new car soon, but now I won't. I was planning on moving into a bigger place soon, but now I won't.   A majority of americans are worse off than I am, and they won't be spending shit beyond bare necessities for a long ass time, and that's if they don't declare bankruptcy.  Even with the strong fed intervention, this makes absolutely no sense. I feel like this whole market is propped up by euphoria, like everyone has silently agreed that if we just pretend everything is ok, reality will catch up with the market eventually, and we all get to be happy, or some shit.  Shit is fucking weird. I feel like the end result is that investors will lose faith in the market, as they no longer reflect reality. And that is not good.|2020-04-14 15:24:37

ndrcp9|g13jnz|g13jnz|17|>We have a strong, well capitalized banking system. - JPow on CNBC  Fucking bullshit. The researchers who wrote the autopsy on the 2008 financial collapse for the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission said:  >‚ÄúFor example, as of 2007, the five major investment banks ‚Äî Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley ‚Äî were operating with extraordinarily thin capital. By one measure, their leverage ratios were as high as 40 to 1, meaning for every $40 in assets, there was only $1 in capital to cover losses. Less than a 3% drop in asset values could wipe out a firm. To make matters worse, much of their borrowing was short-term, in the overnight market‚Äîmeaning the borrowing had to be renewed each and every day‚Ä¶And the leverage was often hidden‚Äîin derivatives positions, in off-balance-sheet entities, and through ‚Äòwindow dressing‚Äô of financial reports available to the investing public.‚Äù  On April 5, JPMorgan Chase had $2.9 trillion exposure in off-balance sheet items versus $2.3 trillion on its balance sheet with $246 billion in equity capital. That information comes directly from JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs [Uniform Bank Performance Report](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=852218&peerGroupType=&supplemental=) for December 31, 2019 at the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Its off-balance sheet ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù items marked simply ‚Äúother,‚Äù total to a whopping $737.5 billion ‚Äì that‚Äôs almost three-quarters of an undefined $1 trillion at the largest bank in the U.S.  Then there is Bank of America. It has $1.85 trillion in assets on its balance sheet and equity capital of $212 billion. But [off its balance sheet it has another $1.5 trillion](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=480228&peerGroupType=&supplemental=).

ndu9ap|g13jnz|g13jnz|15|This is your daily reminder that you got fucked over on your home loan, credit card loan, car loan, student loan, while the banks got artificially low interest rates, and are less credit worthy that you. They are loaning out 4-5x all of their deposits, while you get fucked.  Also, since they can loan out shot loads of money, while getting sweet deals from the Federal Reserve, which is actually just their right hand masturbating themselves. While they scoop off the cum flakes from their stomach and eat them, you are accepting all the empty ball syndromes. You dont have any cum on your face or bank account.  This is because the name "Federal" in ""Federal Reserve" is taking your 2 brain cells into a deep cave dive, and you think the Guuuuuuuhhhverment is doing their best. (To fuck you again like in 2008 to give the banks tendies first in the repo market.)

neu72k|g13jnz|g13jnz|11|I have a play for y'all. Instead of buying puts like an absolute retard, you should enter put debit preads.    The cool thing? If the debit spread is already deep enough ITM, theta actually works FOR YOU. How do you do this? Well, buy an ITM put with little time value and much intrinsic value (like a SPY $320 put expiring in May is nearly all intrinsic value). Then SELL a lower strike SPY put, that has more time value than the put you sold (a $280 put expiring may is a good example).    The max win is 320 - 280 - debit_paid in this example. The max loss is debit_paid.   Breakeven is at:   min(0,x-280) + max(0,320-x) - debit_paid = 0,   For x between 320 and 280 this is at 0+320-x - debit_paid =0, so x = 320 - debit_paid       It's a simple play, you can chose the strikes to have a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing if you wish. With the max win at 100% return and the max loss at (obviously) -100% return.      A naked put has a lot of its value in the "tail" of the probability event. It's just risky, your gains are nearly unlimited, but the chance to actually win is loooow.     Use spreads, you idiots. And use ITM options.|2020-04-14 15:25:19

Banks' earnings this week shouldn't affect SPY much, considering 02/2020 in China where the entire banking sector crashed to garbage while Shanghai Composite is blood flat.  My bet on the next trigger is still Apple. Apple holds the entire market's hope as the best tech company but it's fundamentally dependent on physical products and sales (rather than service and subscription). It's more similar to Dell/HP/Lenovo than Google/Amazon.|2020-04-14 12:44:23

In the 18th century, this meant that *the closer you were to the king and the wealthy, the more you benefitted, and the further away you were, the more you were harmed*. Money, in other words, is not neutral. This general observation, that money printing has distributional consequences that operate through the price system, is known as the ‚ÄúCantillon Effect.‚Äù|2020-04-14 09:42:14

nef72s|g13jnz|g13jnz|6|CNBC be all like, market rallies because there are signs the number of cases/deaths have peaked and the deaths per day can only get better from here. I don't think that's really what is driving the market. Obviously they feel confident that J-Pow has their back with unlimited money. But beyond that, investors are betting ON WHAT DATE the economy will fully reopen.     It's not about the lives lost. You can't put a price on innocent human life, but those who have tried put it at about $10 million per life lost. That would mean that for every 20,000 Americans lost, it's a loss of only $200 billion; insignificant in the face of the Fed's pace of QE.     It's about precisely when the Stay at Home orders will be lifted and people will go back to their jobs (and it assumes they'll still have jobs to go back to). Trump initially said we'd reopen by Easter. Then he moved it back to April 30th. And privately to his people, he's questioned why we can't just open up and let COVID-19 "wash over" the country. But it's not really his decision because Stay at Home orders are on a state by state basis. He can issue guidelines that are in opposition to what governors are doing, but he can't actually rescind their orders.     With SPX at 2843, investors are obviously betting that the country will reopen very soon and that things will normalize. They're content to ignore an entire quarter, even two quarters, as a one-off anomaly that shouldn't even be priced into the stocks. I want to hear from the retards here though. When do you think the various stay at home orders will actually be lifted?     I'm from Illinois and the governor is saying he hasn't made a decision yet about whether to extend the Stay At Home beyond April 30th. We've had very few deaths in Illinois because we shut down so early. I'm torn because I have puts but I also want to get the fuck out of my house. So I'll probably be happy either way.|2020-04-14 13:18:10

Even if AMD dropped to, say, $49? Doesn‚Äôt matter how the market moves, yes?  Enabled spreads and sold to open the next up option, 57.5. Now to wait for it to be filled? And this secured the $1180 price it was, not necessarily my full $2080 equity I have in my $56 AMD Calls?  Now, I can have a bit of peace of mind correct.

Rejection from HOD is very likely right now as RSI is approaching 70 on 15m and 5m. I‚Äôll be damned if we go any higher than this atleast for now. If we do and manage to break 2850 then 2930 is going to be reached with little resistance as long as volume is there.  tl;dr: should see strong rejection here back down to 2810-2800. If not then if we break 2850, 2930 is likely if volume is strong.|2020-04-14 11:22:19

ndtkro|g13jnz|g13jnz|5|If Tesla is the first to market when it comes to level 4-5 autonomy. The margins after building out a fairly conservative model, seem to be it would add at the very least 700 billion dollar market cap to the company, if you believe the assumptions below:  * Traditionally, past software problems that were solved like map navigation spread to other companies fairly rapidly. Algorithms like Dijkstra could be proven and implemented by anyone once understood. Neural nets that solve problems will not be like this. If an engineer from Tesla goes to Uber and implements the same neural net, it's effectively useless without Tesla's proprietary data. The point here is, Tesla, if first to market in this area, will gain a very considerable majority market share >50% globally. * Using Uber's financial numbers, an expense of 75% of revenue goes to drivers. Assuming Tesla halves Uber's prices, it quickly becomes not very economical, especially for those living in cities, to own a car. This means the Tesla network will grow very rapidly as its economic value is immediate. A conservative assumption is 50b annually (this number is derived from looking at Uber's revenue and multiplying by 5 due to the economic incentives of using cheap transportation) in global revenue after the first 2-5 years. There's now at least a 25% margin, which is 12.5b in profit. As a comparison, Microsoft made 40b in profit in 2019. Assuming a revenue growth rate of 50%, that would value this section of the company at least at 600 billion dollars, but likely a lot more given such a dominant position and pricing power the company would have.  There's more to this, but just wanted to share. I never really even considered autonomy in my thesis for investing in Tesla, but it's quite an opportunity. Analysts are disregarding the first mover advantage to this industry. Not to be hyperbolic, but I think this could possibly be one of the highest barrier to entry industries to exist once it forms. Not only would they need data, but they would need access to millions of vehicles to fit with the software to even put a dent in Tesla's market share.|2020-04-14 10:13:52

ne3hqe|g13jnz|g13jnz|3|https://i.imgur.com/xSyZsb3.jpg looks like we‚Äôre about to break below this channel and trendline as RSI is high and volume is dry. Downside likely.  Edit: Attempt to get back in and above. https://i.imgur.com/hqEviTJ.jpg  Edit 2: https://i.imgur.com/OjjxJuv.jpg looking for 2820 break to get our leg down to 2810-2800. Break below that and easy gap to 2785 (50% fib retracement).  Edit 3: This is now the 7th test of this upper daily wedge on 5m chart. https://i.imgur.com/WQZLIml.jpg  Edit 4: Broken above trendline. Very surprisingly. Should reject bottom of previous channel. If it breaks that then it is confirmation for a gap to a minimum of 2835, then 2850.  Edit 5: still testing bottom of previous channel. https://i.imgur.com/xVylyKF.jpg  Edit 6: attempt to get back in channel looks good. https://i.imgur.com/Zmnztws.jpg  Edit 7: Testing bottom of wedge now. Break below and we‚Äôre headed down. https://i.imgur.com/aUo9DZ3.jpg  Edit 8: *sigh* more chop. Back in wedge. https://i.imgur.com/JhfEgIS.jpg looking weak though. I‚Äôm still expecting downside.   Edit 9: Need break below 2820 to confirm downside.  Edit 10: We‚Äôre approaching the end of this wedge. This has to go one way or another. Need to break ~2830 to confirm upside. 2820 to confirm down. https://i.imgur.com/4Vwy8W8.jpg  Edit 11: Welp. https://i.imgur.com/DMSwa4J.jpg 5m closed below. Should see small attempt to get back in as usual. Attempt should fail. Should see down now. 2820 to confirm down.  Edit 12: This is why 2820 in case you‚Äôre wondering https://i.imgur.com/GjA8vwR.jpg  Edit 13: The range continues. Broke upside despite a lot of selling pressure. ~2830 to confirm upside but I‚Äôm still confident on downside here. https://i.imgur.com/bSbRHWG.jpg  Edit 14: now bouncing between bottom range of previous wedge and top range of previous wedge. Wish it would just pick a direction so I can enter my trade. https://i.imgur.com/k2iVWVo.jpg https://i.imgur.com/soPrpka.jpg  Edit 15: Now testing 2830. If we break this (white dotted) we are headed higher short term bar a sell off during power hour. Rejection down to back in wedge (solid white) we are gonna test bottom trend line again (pinkish dotted) https://i.imgur.com/7M9fDpS.jpg I still think downside here.  Edit 16: 2836 (HOD) then 2850.  Edit 17: if volume doesn‚Äôt pick up then rejection of HOD (2836) back to 2830 is likely as RSI is approaching 70 on 5m and 15m. If volume picks up then 2850 is as high as we‚Äôll go given 70 is being touched here on RSI.  Edit 18: HOD reached, 70 RSI, Upper bound on VWAP. Rejection imminent.  Targets: 2836, 2830, 2820, 2800 before we see another bounce.  Edit 19: waiting for ~2840-2850 before I enter my position.  Edit 20: 2830 target reached. Looking for 2820, probably see a bounce there/bigger test. Depending on that 2800 is next, unlikely but if we go below that 2785 is next. If we break below that big gap fill down to 2740.  Edit 21: https://i.imgur.com/K0nIL0l.jpg testing larger trendline now. https://i.imgur.com/XA1I0kD.jpg  Edit 22: Should see bounce at 2820 which tell us if we will gap down to 2800 or re test 2830.  Edit 23: Bounce at 2820 likely. RSI below 50, trendline support, bottom wedge line from yesterday as minor support. Should touch 2820 before re testing 2830. 2830 test will tell us where we‚Äôre going.  As for more medium term. Need to close below 2800 to test 2785 again tomorrow, after 2785 is 2720. Close between 2820 and 2850 will make us range bound tomorrow similar to a few weeks ago until one or the other breaks. If we close above 2850 then 2930 will be reached either tomorrow or later this week. 2930 will be the last major level I see before the rug pull of all rug pulls.  Edit 24: found support at that dotted trendline. 2850 and 2820 range bound. Looking bullish like we‚Äôre going to break 2850. If we do then this week is 2930. Breaking below 2820-2800 supply level (unlikely unless power (half) hour dump) will mean 2785 test tomorrow, which if broken below means 2720 gap fill.  Overall we‚Äôre choppy af unless 2850 is broken (going to 2930 before rug pull) or 2785 is broken (going to 2720 to test, if broken below then rug pull).   Either way this thing ends one way. Down. I kinda want us to break 2850 here so we can just hit 2930 tomorrow and get it over with.  Edit 25: https://i.imgur.com/VuS3z8W.jpg https://i.imgur.com/vtnhZc3.jpg channel here. Bearish as it can be drawn as a wedge as well. With 15m RSI approaching 70 we could see a drop. Even though I want it to just go past 2850 already so like I mentioned before it can hit 2930 and just die. I think we close at ~2830-2826 though.  Edit 26: Closed outside. https://i.imgur.com/sQjdptQ.jpg break below 2833 to confirm. None of this shit matters if we don‚Äôt break 2820 or 2850 though.  Edit 27: Closed at 2837. Flat day tomorrow with range of 2850 and 2820 until one of those are broken. If futures are below or above either level we‚Äôll gap back into the range so don‚Äôt get your hopes up lol.   Again to sum it up:   2850 broken = 2880-2930 followed by rug pull.  2820 broken = gap to 2800 followed by test (could see bounce back to 2850) of 2785 (big test, could see bounce back to 2820), if broken then 2720 (big test, could see bounce back to 2785), followed by gap down to 2630-2650 as next test. At that point I would expect retrace back to 2720 before plummeting to 2550-2580. Then plunge to 2420-2400. Idk what happens at that point whether we see another relief rally (similar to one we are in but obv on a smaller scale) or just simply plow back down to retest lows ~2200.  At this point I‚Äôm just using reddit as a way to document my thoughts lmao.|2020-04-14 11:40:00

ndxzsr|g13jnz|g13jnz|0|**Why EVs will take over**     * EVs are 70%+ cheaper to fuel * EVs should be 70%+ cheaper to maintain (due to significantly less moving parts) once EV service networks reach economies of scale. * Due to experience curves for key components, EVs upfront price should be less than an equivalent ICE car within 0-5 years, varying by market and segment. (Model 3 is already better value than all $44k+ ICE sedans). * EVs should last 2-3x longer than an ICE car in terms of miles (0.5-1 million). * EVs depreciation per year should be significantly less than ICE cars due to their longer lifespans, cheaper cost of ownership and fears of ICE car bans. * Consumers are not stupid, and when EVs are cheaper, they will buy them. * ICE cars kill 4m+ people per year from pollution. * ICE cars will lead to 2 billion + people losing their homes from global warming. * EVs are significantly safer to drive due to front crumple zone, lower center of gravity (limiting rollovers) and lower combustion risk. * Over time, this should drive significantly cheaper insurance vs ICE cars. * All self driving cars will be electric because after stripping out driver costs, an EV taxi service will make 2-4x more profit than an ICE taxi service due to lower fuel, maintenance & depreciation. * Regulations are supportive of the EV transition, particularly in China, and as the EV transition gains momentum it becomes a much easier political decision to ban ICE cars. * EVs are faster to accelerate and brake and are quieter and more fun to drive. * Leaving a car to charge overnight at home or during the day at work is significantly more convenient than regular trips to the gas station. * Fuel independence from Russia, Africa and the Middle East is a major advantage for national defence for countries such as China and much of Europe. * The EV transition will massively accelerate the experience curve for batteries which will make building solar/wind + battery storage cheaper than continuing to operate existing fossil fuel power plants. This will rapidly transition global electricity to renewables and ensure cars are charged by clean sources.  **Why Tesla is best positioned to lead in the $3trn EV market and $2-3trn stationary storage market.**     * Tesla started the EV revolution, they are still leading the revolution 10 years later, they are the company most incentivised to make it happen, they have a business model tailor made for it and all they need is 5% market share generate $40-$50bn+ EBITDA from car sales alone. * Tesla is leading in technology for all key EV components; it has developed the leading battery pack, motor, inverter, cooling system and auto electronics and co-developed the leading battery cells. * Tesla has the leading market share for EVs in terms of volume and generates the vast majority of all gross profit in the global EV industry. * Tesla has the quickest design to mass production cycle time in the industry by a significant margin. This means that not only does it have the leading R&D in the lab, but it gets this R&D into its products significantly quicker. * Tesla has a massive level of vertical integration which will allow it to make higher margins, while selling at lower prices and allowing significant agility to continuously upgrade its technology. * Tesla has a culture of rapid iteration and rapid progress perfectly suited to take advantage of the experience curves for EV components. * Elon has the best track record for disruption and rapid innovation of anyone in the world. * What Musk has already achieved at both Spacex and Tesla is significantly more difficult that what he's got left to do to reach his goals. The breakthroughs to get from 0 to 1% are a lot less visible to the general population than getting from 1% to 100%, but once you are at 1% it gets easier as you have proved technological viability and have momentum on experience curves. * Tesla owns its sales channel and is 100% incentivised to sell EVs. * Tesla has the most capital to invest in the EV transition (yes, this is true). Tesla does not have to waste its cash flow on ICE R&D, capex and redundancies or dividends or share buybacks. Tesla‚Äôs cash flow available for expansion capex is currently running at c.$4bn per year and will grow rapidly with new products. Its shareholders would also be willing to invest more equity to accelerate growth. * Tesla and Elon‚Äôs reputation mean it has the greatest choice of engineering talent. Over 500k people applied for jobs at Tesla in 2017. * Tesla has a vision that its employees, customers and investors believe in and are willing to work towards. * Tesla has the most data and the best track record for battery degradation. Many new EV programs are likely to face significant brand damage when they meet degradation or quality issues. * Tesla has the leading vehicle safety in the market, both for accident avoidance technology and for lower probability of injury once in an accident. * Tesla is debatably the leader in autonomous driving and has by far the largest real world data set to train its AI algorithms. Achieving self-driving could lead to almost unlimited demand for Tesla cars, appreciating second hand car prices and $50-150k profit per car per year to Tesla for every AP2/3 car it has ever sold.|2020-04-14 10:52:57

Even if Q2/Q3 actuals are worse than projection it's not going to crash the markets again because once the case count is low enough shit will be back to normal within a year.  The retail investor who's actually got enough money to throw into the market isn't laid off and their company has enough cash on hand to weather the storm.

nefdxl|g13jnz|g13jnz|1|So I have a few 5/15 SPY 200-250 PUTS which are down like 95% so I don't care about them anymore. I will let them roll or expire worthless. I can just hope SPY drops eventually. Anyways I would have made a massive loss had I not bought calls when it crossed 260 resistance which I sold for a profit at 275. Added some more SPY 300 calls yesterday before market close. Target is to sell half when SPY hits 285-290 range. Let the remaining roll and sell if SPY hits 300 or up. This way now I am still diamond hands on my currently worthless SPY 250 PUTS (which could eventually still print) but also recovered those losses + some extra  This strategy is only working for me because SPY is super volatile in this mad market right now and it could very much drop down 30-50 points in 2-3 weeks|2020-04-14 13:19:49

ne445h|g13jnz|g13jnz|-5|Boys, I am going to make a DD about this soon, but you need to buy $VIRT calls. Look at 05/20 30c.   VIRT is a market maker, they make money on volatility. The last time the VIX spiked in 2018, VIRT went from 18 to 36.   VIRT is currently trading at $24. Earnings is on May 7th. They will post an INSANE earning amount. Get your calls now. $VIRT 05/20 @ 30c|2020-04-14 11:45:16
