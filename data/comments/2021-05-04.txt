And it all happened so gradually over the last three months that I'd hardly noticed. I just wish people who hadn't been a part of WSB or at least lurked before GME would fuck off. Like a Great Purge.  I'm well aware that my decisions to buy speculative stocks can bite me in the ass. I don't need *your dumb ass* to reiterate that which is already an understood concept.

ww4f97|n4klyx|n4klyx|22|Stock futures are mostly flat this morning. Tech is seeing a bit of selling, with the Nasdaq off 0.3%.  This follows a day of reopening optimism that lifted retail stocks. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will fully re-open on May 19. Florida is open effective immediately.  So the rotation trade is apparently back. Not much in the way of economic data today. Factory orders at 0830. We do have a bunch of earnings: CVS and DuPont just beat. Later we have Pfizer, Activision Blizzard, Akamai, and some oil majors: ConocoPhillips, Marathon Petroleum, Dominion Energy, Devon Energy.   Oil is up this morning, by the way. Crude up 1.8% to $65.50, another post-pandemic high.  Looks like things might be melting up. Sell in May and go away at your peril. Not sure there was ever any real basis for that anyway. Just sounds good.|2021-05-04 05:50:26

wwi8kj|n4klyx|n4klyx|22|Yes, the market does actually go down, kids.  THIS is when money is made. THIS is when there are expected dips AND unexpected dips in shit stocks and solid ones.  Do your research, buy some dips.  If you liked a stock at $50 then you will sure as f\*ck like it much more at $40. When everyone went into their panic rooms last March, cooler hands went in and bought JPM (it was in the $80s, it's now $150), FDX (it was in the $90s and it's now $300+), or CAT (went to $90s and it's now $225+).   Relax. Hold the good stuff even if you feel like you'll be "underwater forever" at that price, especially if it's got a decent dividend.   On that note, I bought more PLUG this morning.

It impacts every part of your life.

ww3gpu|n4klyx|n4klyx|3|“THE MARKET IS CONSTIPATED”  Most don’t understand wtf is going on in this market, including myself. And like most I make up my own story in order to be at ease and decide what to buy /sell.   Overall think the explanation is quite easy and straightforward. “THE MARKET IS CONSTIPATED” Since last year it ate a ton of shit SPACS, shit EV stocks and wanna be vaccine wanna be biopharma companies”.   So constipated it can’t go up even when the Crown jewels; MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GS, JPM are doing amazingly well and deserve to go up.    The only remedy is for the market to take a massive shit and it’s not whether it will it’s just a question of when.  And after last week and yesterday it may be much closer than we all May think.|2021-05-04 05:37:48

wwzfh1|n4klyx|n4klyx|5|Hi, me mo mo Tim Heidecker, and welcome to discount prices. I’ve got $1.99. I’ve got $7.99. I’ve got $16.99, cheap cheap cheap prices. $14.00, $11.00. $2.49, $3.00. My prices are so small you can barely see them, small prices. Tim’s discounted prices shatter to the ground. Buy premium prices. Hi, I’m Eric, and welcome to Eric’s premium prices. I’ve got all the premium prices. I’ve got $19.99 for sale for $20.00. You come to me when you want Fine European Prices. They’re premium. Come on in. Buy $35.50 for $40.00.  Oh, lay an egg. Go to Tim’s discount prices. Our $6.99s are down to $2.99.  Tim buys his prices from China. Mine are real, American made.  Who used to pay a premium for prices? Come on to Tim’s discount prices and pay small prices.  Look at this discounted price. There’s no meat on it. You throw it back. Stay in the water. I’m not going to serve you to my family.  The man is a dirty fellow. He’s got a stink down here.  Discount price are for the birds. Tim’s got crap prices. Kick it.  Don’t let Eric get near you. He’ll rape ya.  Tim makes up random prices and sells them in a discount. That’s bullshit…  Eric is a compulsive masturbator. He masturbates all over the store.  My competitor is a liar. Cut it out.

wxq30j|n4klyx|n4klyx|6|“There’s no good picks left”-the market. Meanwhile JD sitting at a single digit forward p/e and a market cap less than its revenue last year, Baba undervalued af and beats every earnings, and NIO already solved their own chip shortage issue before it became priced in and is making a fucking super factory that will net them 1 million cars a year. And there’s plenty of decent US value stocks if you sort through em as well, like qualcomm trading at 133 and they will be netting 7 dollars a share for earnings seasons soon. There’s plenty of good picks out there right now, even big tech will grow into their valuations within a fucking year, market makers have no real excuse they just want to burn it all down to fuck retail. Don’t buy short dated options, they will quit this bullshit when WSB quits donating them money, they are literally targeting us and options players, if you haven’t figured this out yet...please do|2021-05-04 14:13:06
