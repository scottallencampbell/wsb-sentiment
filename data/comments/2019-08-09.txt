The headline EPS shortfall is due to confusion around timing of the reverse stock split, yet net income of -9.86mn was better than our -11.4mn. Gross margin of 55.6% was 170bps below our estimate due to an acceleration of expenses that should reverse in 3Q, but tight opex controls boosted operating profit to -9.44mn above our -10.1mn. 3Q revenue/EPS guidance was in-line at $48.0mn/-14c vs our $48.1mn/-13c and FY19 revenue/EPS guidance of $193mn/-55c was a tad above our $191mn/-56c.

wf30a8|co0uvn|co0uvn|8|Yuana know something..  The construction sector is also considered a fundamental leading indicator of the business cycle, given its correlation with the U.S. housing cycle. Figure 2 plots the dynamics of employment for the construction sector as a proxy for the housing cycle in the U.S. and compares it with the dynamics of total nonfarm employment using the methodology described above: The use of construction employment yields similar results to the use of manufacturing employment. In some cycles, notably the episode of October 1980, construction employment slows prior to a yield curve inversion. However, construction employment generally moves contemporaneously with total employment prior to yield curve inversions. Similar to manufacturing, this seems to rule out current housing trends as an earlier and more consistent leading indicator than yield curve inversions.|2019-08-09 06:13:45

If you're bagholding here, your best case scenario over the next 12 months is a buyout or merger.  Not sure what the point of bagholding is here unless your horizon is literally 2+ years out...  It's got to show that it can either reach a faster growth curve or can hold its present level of growth longer than expected to fully grow into a higher valuation.|2019-08-09 08:55:32

wg8hca|co0uvn|co0uvn|2|DD thread on OSTK got deleted, so here it is if anyone cares:  OSTK is the stock to follow over the next couple of weeks if you're looking for another BYND-like situation where longs force the price up to try to get shorts to capitulate.  This looks like a potential short squeeze in motion. S3's pre-earnings update: " [$OSTK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24OSTK&src=cashtag_click) short int is $381 mm; 17.23 mm shs shorted; 60.81% of float; 61.86% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +4.8 mm,+38.4%, in 2019; +637k, +3.84%, over the last 30 days; but down -618k, -3.46%, over the last week. There has been some covering ahead of the [\#Overstock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overstock?src=hashtag_click)'s earnings. "  Obviously OSTK hit it out of the park on earnings and is near $25, but there was some covering before earnings, so we need to wait and see what the current short interest/borrow fee levels are next week.  We'll have to see how the short interest and numbers look in the days ahead post-earnings bump. Might be best to just keep it in mind and follow the short interest/borrow fee levels. If the shorts cover too quickly and borrow fees come down fast, there won't be much of a squeeze here.  The squeeze scenario probably requires short interest to stay over 50% and borrow fees stay over 50% which would lead algs/longs to try to force this to mid-30s or higher. My advice is to let the IV come down and see if there's some calm before another potential leg up develops.  Note that in 2017 when it mooned, OSTK was just following BTC due to crypto announcements they made. There might be some of that kind of effect at play too given their blockchain work with tZero; so crypto rocketing due to currency war probably helps this thesis.|2019-08-09 13:43:52
