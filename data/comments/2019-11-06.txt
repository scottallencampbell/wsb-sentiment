6p43x7|dsespz|dsespz|136|Can I just say how incredibly proud I am of this community? I was going to make this a separate post, but I figure here is just as good to thank our PRT soldiers in the field today. The solemn pride I have is the result of years work on my part to troll Robinhood, and point out how incredibly predatory their shitty, retard-bait app is on the tendencies of young autistic men like ourselves.   When I was banned from Wallstreetbets for about 9 months a while back, I began posting my memes on Robinhood. The corporate, Californian, asshor licking ikemen they are - they wrote an email to the Robinhood subreddit team saying I wasn't "inclusive" enough or some shit. Which is bullshit, probably written by an Indian. Anyways they got me banned from my refugee subreddit and one month later I was back on WSB.   To see our movement of truly retarded people, embodied by our Guh-d, CTN, take down this piece of corporate garbage gives me immense satisfaction. But to have it done via a blatantly obvious glitch, providing free money to arguably the most retarded and reckless people on Earth, brings me a sense of satisfaction that I cannot explain. I thank each and every one of you for your service. You have lived our creed, and fulfilled the promise of our shining city on a hill of other people's money.   Yours sincerely,   General Haupt91|2019-11-06 07:27:11

6q8fos|dsespz|dsespz|12|Time for **Magical Crayons TA.**  As predicted [last Friday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dq9hiv/weekend_discussion_thread_november_13_2019/f61pyc4/) the technical correction was supposed to hit Nov 6-7. We hit right on time to the date which is spooky AF. We filled our most recent gap at 306.2 almost perfectly and recovered, which is a bullish sign. Again, if you're a bull you want these small pullbacks for continued running.   We still haven't fully resolved the wedge (we're still trading in it) but because of strong buying I'm not sure how far the next drop is, if we see it at all -- the market is currently far stronger than I could have anticipated. If you wanted me to guess, it would have to be a collapse of 306 tomorrow which will push us towards 304.5, which will fill our most second recent gap. If we never see 306 by EOD tomorrow we have increasing support, which will mean that the 304ish level will be in the rearview mirror for the short term if a future drop does occur.  If we DO touch the 305 range tomorrow but trade between 307 and 305 for a day or two, it's good for bulls from a technical standpoint. Collapse of 304.5 is obviously a negative sign as we'd be heading towards neutral sentiment, which would put the current bullish trends in danger.  All in all, nothing technically has changed. Stonks still strong, market still strong, GUH still GUH. Continue onwards friends.|2019-11-06 14:38:31

6pgbgn|dsespz|dsespz|4|ROKU ROKU ROKU...  Been holding on to 200 shares of this bad boy since IPO... I'm really bullish on it but I'm about at my risk tolerance for it. Also volatility prices for earnings are insanity.  Sell covered calls at high strike prices?  Hold shares and make no other plays?  Buy more calls and yolo earnings?  Be a weenie and buy protective puts to not get demolished?  Bull put calendar spreads?  Bull call calendar spreads?  So many options... I'm probably just going to hold shares and hope for moon.  &#x200B;  Edit: Thanks for all the replies gents. I'm bullish enough that I really don't want the shares to get called away, so I'm not really considering selling calls that are any lower than 150 strike price. It's not worth the few hundred bucks of premium to sell 160+ strikes for me. I think 20+% moves are not out of the question...  Last earnings call they reported being the operating system of 1 out of every 3 TV's sold in the US, much larger than anticipated monetization of users, and phenomenal growth...  I think decent chance they don't meet the hype (I'd say 60% chance this stock drops after earnings, but if they exceed the hype I think there's a 20% chance of a 20+% move).

[then some map geek posted this.](https://i.redd.it/lv4mw88hwdv31.png)  The missing persons regions match perfectly with cave heavy regions. All these people just died in caves. They werent kidnapped by "satanists" or the "deep state" or bigfoot or UFOs.  That's why we dont have their bodies. No one bothered looking too deep in there. Its dangerous for rescue crews to go too deep. So we just write them off.  Paulides career just ended. no one is buying his bullshit 'wink wink' conspiracies anymore. Its just poor souls who thought caving would be fun or fell in while drunk and never made it out. What a masterful scam though.

You can get a gym membership for cheaper that has in person spin classes that are better.   Any serious cyclist would use an actual bike with a trainer. Anyone buying a peleton is likely an out of shape "this will be what will get me into shape" buyer. Those kind of buyers probably fall off the wagon within 6 months and will cancel their sub.   Beyond that is isn't like the $2000 bike is anything someone would buy again after the first time. Once you have a stationary bike, there is no reason for you to ever buy on again, it isn't like a phone. It isn't some "gotta have the latest one" tech device.|2019-11-06 10:52:48

As I've said this entire week this correction is expected and suits technical trading patterns. Because we're in a bullish market, dips WILL be bought up and buyers will step in. The support today is 305.5 and another at 304.8. I expect a lot of fighting before 305.5 if it touches that level today so if you're holding puts and want to lock in gains sell a bit before that level.

6qdlgl|dsespz|dsespz|2|Email I just got from $REAL CEO...  To Our Customers & Consignors:  Hello. I am writing to you today as valued customers and consignors of The RealReal who have helped us become the leader in authenticated luxury consignment over the past eight years. You may have seen recent media stories attempting to discredit the business we have so proudly built. Please allow me to share some insight with you.  Counterfeiting is a global issue and those engaged in its practice are egregious and relentless. Therefore, the entire team at The RealReal works diligently seven days a week to ensure the highest standards in our authentication practices. We employ certified experts such as gemologists and horologists, luxury experts who have worked at companies like Sotheby‚Äôs and Christie‚Äôs, and brand experts who have worked directly for luxury brands. We are constantly and consistently training our teams, and evolving our technologies to ensure your items are the real thing. There is no other resale company doing more to remove fakes, and put counterfeiters out of business, than The RealReal.  This is a complex problem, and fighting global counterfeiters is hard work. We strive for perfection, but may not be perfect every single time. As has always been our policy, if there is ever a concern about an item, it can be sent back and we will make sure the issue is resolved to your satisfaction.  Our pledge is to provide you with the best, safest and most secure place to purchase authenticated luxury consignment. Thank you for your trust in us.  Julie Wainwright  Founder & CEO|2019-11-06 15:22:13
