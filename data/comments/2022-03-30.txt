2pb40x|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|91|A man walks into a village and says to the villagers, “I’ll give you 10 bucks for each pig you can find”.   The villagers think this is a reasonable offer, and they go around rounding up a bunch of pigs to sell to the man.   After a while the pigs start to become scarce, and the man says “fine, I’ll give you 30 bucks for each pig”. The villagers once again go around collecting whatever pigs they can find, and sell them to the man.   After a while, almost no pigs remain. The man says “I’ll give you 100 bucks for any pig you can find me, but I have to run to town really quick, so please sell them to my assistant”.   The man runs off to town. The villagers are having a very difficult time finding pigs, and after a while the assistant says “you know what, why don’t I sell you some of these pigs here for 50 bucks, and you can just sell them to the man for 100 when he gets back”.  The villagers all scramble to buy as many pigs as they can, they spend their life savings on these pigs.   And they never see the man or his assistant ever again.   This is 🌽|2022-03-30 06:37:49

2qvoyj|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|3|'So far, the EU and G7 nations have rejected Russia’s demand to switch their payments for gas to rubles. Russia said it will not provide free gas supplies, suggesting that it is ready to shut off the taps. If that happens Moscow would lose between €200 million to €800 million each day of the embargo. However, Russia could redirect some of the gas to Asia. Europe would likely face an economic crisis not seen since WWII, as soaring energy prices would send the region’s economies into recession. So, who will blink first? Place your bets.'  Taken from an rt article. Damn, if nobody blinks, gas prices gonna soar even higher. This is worth a yolo play|2022-03-30 13:25:51

Consumer sentiment and spending were actually down last quarter.  Next quarter's numbers are going to be a 'shock' at how anemic they are.  It's not shocking when you look below the hood of last quarter's GDP #s.  They aren't sustainable growth at all.    Current FED GDPNow for Q1 is 0.9%. That's a huge drop from 6.9%!

2qqfas|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|7|Unfortunately for Apes, the longer the stock doesn’t squeeze more upward, the more likely to fall. As time goes on and the stock stays flat/down, the theta eats into the premium calls. When the premium drops the gamma does too which means market makers can reduce their hedge against the calls they sold: meaning they can sell their shares proportional to the % chance the options will expire in the money.   In other words: as GME doesn’t go up, MMs are slowly selling shares because they can reduce their hedge sizes.|2022-03-30 12:51:10

2q1kff|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|2|Does anyone here actually have shares in the market right now? With Fed hikes, 10-2 yield inverting yesterday, inflation accelerating, asset tapering, reformation of the global economy, suppy chain issues, China lockdowns, and coming out of an "outlier" year in terms of consumer spending; do you really see a case where the indices continue to increase for the foreseeable future?  The average SP500 PE ratio is 26, from 2010-2020 it was around 20 and this with a stimulative economy and sustainable growth.  I guess my question is, do you see the current PE ratios climbing higher despite already being 25%+ above the 10 year average in this environment and if so why?|2022-03-30 10:06:33

It may also happen when antibodies are present at sub-neutralizing concentrations (yielding occupancies on viral epitopes below the threshold for neutralization),[5][6] or when the strength of antibody-antigen interaction is below a certain threshold  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement  VADE = Vaccine induced antibody dependent enhancement.

In the first week of January, the Co. addressed all FDA concerns by doing everything the FDA asked of them.  If the blockbuster drug is approved, the stock should go to $100 or higher, giving us a fifty to one return in just a few weeks. If the approval comes in late April, @#$% it. It's worth a shot.  The reason we're shooting for this early April window is because, according to the AXSM CEO, the FDA typically responds within three months (from early January).|2022-03-30 12:00:41

2qcxea|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|-2|KLIC short interest is currently 61%, which is higher than AMC or GME.  So KLIC recently did a $150 Million dollar share buyback. These buybacks are usually performed gradually over the course of weeks or months. But KLIC's buyback was instantaneous. This means that there must be an institution that opened a large short position to give KLIC these shares. Normally I think short squeezes are retarded, but the company is extremely solid. They have a low p/e and are the global leader in wirebonding for semiconductors.|2022-03-30 11:22:47

2p7ari|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|-4|so if inflation is 6% and company grows 6% it doesnt really grow. But still probably plows money to working capital and maintenance capex 6 % more on average? thus invests like it would expand 6%. So say a company has a 12% ROIC, and it grows 6% so it has plow back half of its earnings or something? FCF drops like 50% or something?   im too lazy to take a pencil and paper so I might be wrong. what a fucking pain in the ass this inflation to cash flow. And then that fucker eats from my discount rate as well.   I need to buy exceptionally high ROIC companies among the stable ones and companies that improve quite a bit if I play the rate of change game. What a fucking pain in the ass it is to look for those opportunities. Might be easier to just play puts. Then on the other hand I should know what to buy if my puts print so anyway I have to do the research.
