With Fed hikes, 10-2 yield inverting yesterday, inflation accelerating, asset tapering, reformation of the global economy, suppy chain issues, China lockdowns, and coming out of an "outlier" year in terms of consumer spending; do you really see a case where the indices continue to increase for the foreseeable future?  The average SP500 PE ratio is 26, from 2010-2020 it was around 20 and this with a stimulative economy and sustainable growth.  I guess my question is, do you see the current PE ratios climbing higher despite already being 25%+ above the 10 year average in this environment and if so why?|2022-03-30 10:06:33

2psfwt|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|3|Lower volume is usually not a great sign for squeezes, but you need to keep in mind that a lot of apes have literally cornered themselves into DRS. With little to no net covering over the last few days, I'd say this thing still has a lot of juice (unless SPY tanks bigly). However, there is huge OI for this week, if MMs can hold out, this loses a lot of short term juice.  Full disclaimer I'm short AMC at $22 with plenty of margin. Made quite a bit shorting it since November so I'm fine tapping out tbh, but also looking to add some cash to the account and just long hold this garbage back to teens. We'll see.|2022-03-30 09:04:04

It may also happen when antibodies are present at sub-neutralizing concentrations (yielding occupancies on viral epitopes below the threshold for neutralization),[5][6] or when the strength of antibody-antigen interaction is below a certain threshold  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement  VADE = Vaccine induced antibody dependent enhancement.

In the first week of January, the Co. addressed all FDA concerns by doing everything the FDA asked of them.  If the blockbuster drug is approved, the stock should go to $100 or higher, giving us a fifty to one return in just a few weeks. If the approval comes in late April, @#$% it. It's worth a shot.  The reason we're shooting for this early April window is because, according to the AXSM CEO, the FDA typically responds within three months (from early January).|2022-03-30 12:00:41

2qcxea|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|-2|KLIC short interest is currently 61%, which is higher than AMC or GME.  So KLIC recently did a $150 Million dollar share buyback. These buybacks are usually performed gradually over the course of weeks or months. But KLIC's buyback was instantaneous. This means that there must be an institution that opened a large short position to give KLIC these shares. Normally I think short squeezes are retarded, but the company is extremely solid. They have a low p/e and are the global leader in wirebonding for semiconductors.|2022-03-30 11:22:47

2p7ari|ts2yb1|ts2yb1|-4|so if inflation is 6% and company grows 6% it doesnt really grow. But still probably plows money to working capital and maintenance capex 6 % more on average? thus invests like it would expand 6%. So say a company has a 12% ROIC, and it grows 6% so it has plow back half of its earnings or something? FCF drops like 50% or something?   im too lazy to take a pencil and paper so I might be wrong. what a fucking pain in the ass this inflation to cash flow. And then that fucker eats from my discount rate as well.   I need to buy exceptionally high ROIC companies among the stable ones and companies that improve quite a bit if I play the rate of change game. What a fucking pain in the ass it is to look for those opportunities. Might be easier to just play puts. Then on the other hand I should know what to buy if my puts print so anyway I have to do the research. Fucking fuck. oh well might as well try to make money with puts while doing dd.|2022-03-30 05:55:40
