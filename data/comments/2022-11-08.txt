vj8l6r|ypipxo|ypipxo|78|Here's a recap of the FTX drama that's on the verge of killing the corn market:  -	FTX creates their own version of corn out of literally nothing. -	FTX then “gifts” their homegrown corn to a trading firm owned by FTX’s CEO. -	The trading firm then takes out loans using the FTX corn as collateral. -	Anytime the trading firm needs to puff up their balance sheet, they just have FTX grow more of their special corn and gift it to them. -	A competing corn exchange company also holds a large amount of FTX corn and is currently liquidating their position entirely, purposefully driving the price down to force the insolvency of both FTX and the trading firm owned by the CEO of FTX. -	FTX is the world's 2nd largest corn exchange by trading volume, their insolvency will likely destroy the corn market.  This is a private company based in the Bahamas printing their own money and using it to manipulate a trillion dollar market. And cornbros willingly invest in this type of environment?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  Thanks, but no thanks. I think I'll stick to writing OTM 0 DTE SPY options to be bought up by WSB degens.  Edit: Binance and FTX have "come to an agreement on a strategic transaction." Wow, looks like this was all a hostile takeover by Binance. Amazing maneuvers by Binance, genuinely exciting to witness in real time. And now everything pumps.  Edit 2: …well that pump was short lived. The excitement continues with FTX corn **dropping over 70% in less than 24 hours**.|2022-11-08 05:11:00

vk7d5y|ypipxo|ypipxo|7|I know there's a million stories like this out here but I thought I'd share mine anyway. I was in Las Vegas recently on vacation with some friends. Someone in our group mentioned that the smaller "locals" casinos have better odds and payouts than the strip properties. We found this little hole in the wall place with like 8 machines in it, didn't seem like a nice area but are from out of town and didn't want to get lost. We walked inside and the smell of cigarettes and old carpet immediately takes over. There's only two people at opposite ends of the bar and the bartender is nowhere to be found. I sit next to the guy on the left and jokingly say to him, "what's a guy gotta do to get a drink around here." The man looked back at me and said, "you have to gamble and then you'll get you drink for free." He gave me a little grin and didn't look away for over 30 seconds. I noticed when we locked eyes that one of his eyes was a prosthetic and then it hit me. I knew this guy. This random guy sitting in this shitty bar was Michael Burry. I tried talking to him again but he acted like he couldn't hear me, and he kept feeding $5 bills one at a time into the machine even though he wasn't running out of money. After 2 and a half hours, my friends and I left, and not once did Michael Burry look up from playing 3 6 9 keno. As soon as we got up to leave I noticed that he poured his orange juice on the seat i was sitting in to presumably deter anyone else from sitting next to him.|2022-11-08 10:01:29

Everybody hates the Cops until it’s their shit that gets took.  EDIT: I’m not shitting on crypto as a whole. Coins like Ethereum (just one example of many) have real use cases and compelling arguments as investments. HOWEVER these exchanges and crypto influencers are not your friends. If you’re serious about owning crypto learn how to do it properly and know what you’re owning instead of forking over your cash to offshore exchanges for their proprietary shitcoins.|2022-11-08 08:02:25

vkr6rz|ypipxo|ypipxo|3|As far as the midterm, elections and Republicans and democrats, and how they affect the market, it’s always pretty laughable that voters perceive Republicans as good for the economy when, in fact, they’re terrible at fiscal policy, but really great at giving lots of money back to rich people.  The economy does better factually longer-term when Democrats are in charge if you look at the years of Clinton versus Reagan, or if you look at the years of Obama versus bush.  But the media and political parties like to spend their own narrative and so the people are duped time and time again.   if the lunatic Maga Republicans take control of the House and the Senate, you can expect gridlock which the market will like. The Santarelli will get turbo charged for sure. Ethically and morally. I would not like this to happen and hope that the Democrats retain control. Everything isn’t about money and long-term you make more money with Democrats in charge.|2022-11-08 12:09:46

vjv67x|ypipxo|ypipxo|0|My ex broke up with me 2 weeks ago because of severe depression. We were together for 1 year. I saw this depression in waves. She said she couldn't handle a relationship on top of her depression. She said she loves me and as much as she can love me right now. Everything was fine until the day of the breakup. I got a phone call and text. I know deep down she wanted us to happen. I’m going to give her space- even if it’s forever. Our relationship was great- i never put a ton of pressure on her. Her friends and family loved me. I’m at loss. I know I probably dodged a bullet but right now it feels like I've been shot.   Her depression was bad. She was anorexic, slept too little/ too much, smoked a lot of pot, and struggled to go to work.  This breakup feels really bad. I can’t help her. She said doesn't want help and needs to fight this alone even if it means shutting everyone else out. What do I do besides give her space and move on. Are there hopes of salvaging this relationship? Do depressed partners come back?|2022-11-08 08:39:41

vjwz61|ypipxo|ypipxo|1|Spy fighting for its life at 380. I think theres a good chance we hit 382 today but I would prefer we go the other route and get to atleast 379 again. Its had enough volume over 380 I wouldn't consider it a resistance line anymore than matter, which means to me that 382 is semi inevitable. Hopefully I'm wrong, but if so I will double down on puts. Might get a few more at 381, but realistically if we go above 381 and chill then we are 100% retesting 382.|2022-11-08 08:52:16
