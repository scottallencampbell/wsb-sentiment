For Reddit‚Äôs band of self-styled ‚Äúautists‚Äù‚Äîa term of endearment, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people‚Äîthe chief prize is ‚Äútendies‚Äù (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a ‚ÄúGood Boy‚Äù). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.

Again on the VIX, we would need to see vix drop below the 21ish level to indicate a bearish to bullish reversal. There also exists a resistance level on the VIX at the ~20.30 level.   Downside target extension is around 3078 if we reach the 3100 level again. Hard to say what will happen with this much volatility.  Trade safely my friends.|2020-02-26 08:19:25

iun25c|f9rm6p|f9rm6p|10|MID DAY MAGICAL LINE TA (/ES):  So as many of us thought, there was a big pump at open (+1%) which actually brought us up to a previous extension (3173) that we blew past yesterday. Tried to break through twice before rejecting hard through 3147 which then acted as resistance. It then tried to break and hold above 3147 before dropping HARD right as the candle touched the 200ma (5 minute chart). It fell right through the 3125 level that we bounced around eod yesterday before some good news from NY caused a momentary green dildo. We're currently testing 3125 again to see if we can break and hold above. We've already tested and failed on 2 consecutive 5 min candles and if we see 1 or 2 more failures, I'd think we're headed down to 3104 which is the next extension down.

iusmbi|f9rm6p|f9rm6p|17|A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.  The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open.  On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which has been designated as SARS-CoV-2.  France reported the first death of a French citizen from the epidemic as cases grew rapidly across Europe, with Spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in Germany, Greece, France, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland. A new case in Brazil marks the first known case in Latin America. Although China announced a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the number of infected people soared in South Korea to more than 1,200, with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200,000 people.  Here are the latest developments:  ‚óè A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday, bringing the country‚Äôs total to 15.  ‚óè France reported the first coronavirus death of a French citizen amid a dramatic uptick in cases within Europe. Most new cases are connected to an outbreak in northern Italy, still the largest on the continent.  ‚óè Brazil confirmed its first case, which also marks the first known case in Latin America.  ‚óè Europe‚Äôs benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.6 percent in midday trading Wednesday, while Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7 percent and Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 closed down nearly 0.8 percent, as the coronavirus‚Äôs rapid spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea seemed to reinforce investor fears that the worst is yet to come.  ‚óè Statistics released by the Chinese government showed a decline in the number of new cases in mainland China; an additional 406 cases were reported Wednesday morning, along with 52 deaths. All but five of the new cases and all of the new deaths were in Hubei province.  ‚óè South Korea reported 284 additional cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, raising the national tally to 1,261. That number is expected to rise in coming days as the country begins the mass testing of more than 200,000 members of a messianic religious movement at the center of an outbreak in the city of Daegu.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/02/26/f889693a-580e-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036_story.html?utm_source=reddit.com|2020-02-26 14:05:07

itupyh|f9rm6p|f9rm6p|14|Looks like the market is finally reacting rationally to the virus. Ironically, my puts expired last week. What a sick world we live in.   Sold my msft calls (aprils, so only down 50% compared to 90% March 20's) and bought a tqqq put at today's top. Already up 50 dollars. Only 350 dollars more to go!   My prediction is that the market will trade down to flat or just a bit percentage higher than flat today. I think it'll pump and dump Thursday too and then just DUMP eod Friday.  I think any common retail investor is spooked AF and big investors are going to wait to see virus developments before they go back in for real.   I believe that we won't enter a recession and that this is a healthy correction. However, the correction likely isn't over. We could see a sort of mini-recession until this virus passes but I don't see it killing the economy *yet*   I read an article about ppl investing in India as a virus safe haven. That seems insane and if I could bet on any country getting fucked by this virus it would be India. Once more than 10 cases are in India I'm buying puts.|2020-02-26 09:10:10

The one thing Donny can do to save or reverse the market is the one thing he has never shown an ability to project...   Cautious optimism.    If he comes out the gates saying it‚Äôs terrible but we‚Äôve got it under control the market will tank    If he comes out saying everything is fine, don‚Äôt worry... well we all know that‚Äôs a lie.    If he comes out with a rate cut, then we know shit is fucked and we are selling off and gold will rocket.   But.  If he comes out with cautious optimism and levelly talks about the possibilities, the market could have a recovery until it shits the bed again.

Based upon some quick research, it becomes quite rare once the equity indexes are down 7 days in a row.  8 days is rarer, and 9 only happens about once a decade.  With 5 days down, the market often recovers losses in about 2 weeks.  Once you hit 7 days, recovery time increases to about 30 days, and once you hit 8 days, recovery time increases to more than 60 days.  Regardless of how long it takes, once thing is always true... the market always recovers and hits new ATHs.

I'm guessing he will say we have it all under control, CDC doing amazing job, etc. He might even announce funding for it.  I'm thinking we might even open green tomorrow before market realizes none of that matters and we go right back down Fri or next week.|2020-02-26 09:39:51

iubaid|f9rm6p|f9rm6p|8|This is not going to be a long lasting recession, it's literally just overreaction to the virus. But we will see more cliffs. Buy positions now that they're cheap, but only buy a little each day and keep lowering your average.   In the short term, buy puts with close expiration, or buy calls on inverse ETFs. Make some profit off the puts, and continue to add to your positions for the distant futures. Stocks will be fine in the long term.  I keep seeing everyone complain that they keep missing. That's because you're buying too late. Put the bulk of your money into positions for the Long haul. Either buy shares or options several months out. Buy puts or calls on inverse ETFs and hold them all. The puts will profit soon enough, so just wait. The rest of your positions will lose money, for now. But like I said, tack on a little each day and keep lowering the average cost of your shares/options and just wait. The stock market isn't dead forever. Once bat flu is dealt with, they will rise. You made money on puts in the short term and now your long term positions will show big gains  Unless this IS going to be sustained recession and we're entering bear market territory.

itjdd2|f9rm6p|f9rm6p|5|Virus is still spreading implying economic activity goes to 0 as it grows.   That's why markets continue to go down.  It's a race between spread and the Spring when temperature goes above 25, and we see if it reduces the spread.  Look to brazil. Theres a case there and weak public health. If it grows rapidly there then Spring wont stop the virus.  The growth is slow in thailad/vietnam/singapore so it supports that virus will eb seasonal because of a warm climate.  Brazil is a good test  es for this hypthosesis.  Bears feast on this 20% correction.  Bulls join us or gather money for the continuation of repo in late spring; perhaps when the virus slows.   Bears switch teams in late spring in preparation for repo continuing with Fed QE.|2020-02-26 06:57:14

iufave|f9rm6p|f9rm6p|5|Guys lets be realistic here.  The Corona virus is only going to shift the demand for the products and services a month or two forward\*. This combined with the market pricing in the lost revenue means that as soon as the companies start posting their Q1 2020 earnings the stocks are going to pump to ATH. This correction is just an overreaction to the virus (market didn't price it in before), and people looking for a reason to sell (stocks were too hot).  If you're calls are a few months out you'll be fine.  I might be retarded tho since I put half of my portfolio in TQQQ and the other half in QQQ June 30 $240 calls so don't listen to me.  &#x200B;  Adding on my other reply.  The virus hit during Chinese new years when the factories were already shut down. The new year holiday just got extended for a week. (source [https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-extends-lunar-new-year-holiday-february-2-shanghai-february-9-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-extends-lunar-new-year-holiday-february-2-shanghai-february-9-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/) ).  New cases of the virus have also started decreasing in China meaning the worst is over. (source -  [https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/in-china-newly-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-infection-are-falling](https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/22/in-china-newly-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-infection-are-falling) )  Right now Xi is trying to get the factories back in production and considering the circumstances they're doing quite well (some provinces have 90%+ of their businesses and factories reopened) (source - [https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/25/as-its-covid-19-epidemic-slows-china-tries-to-get-back-to-work](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/25/as-its-covid-19-epidemic-slows-china-tries-to-get-back-to-work) ). We only lost a few weeks of production (which could potentially be made up for) and a few weeks of consumer/business demand (demand will shift from Jan and Feb to March and April). Unless a companies quarter ends in March or earlier you'll be fine.  **Reply**|2020-02-26 12:05:03

itqxux|f9rm6p|f9rm6p|2|> (Bloomberg) -- They don‚Äôt ring a bell at the top -- or the bottom. There are signs that U.S. equity trading is becoming more emotionally-driven, but there are enough crosscurrents to keep the picture murky, suggesting there‚Äôs **no capitulation yet.** Total U.S. trading volume on a five-day moving average basis has jumped to the highest since late December 2018. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs been a fast rise in the CBOE‚Äôs total put/call ratio as playing defense becomes more dear. Still, neither one is at extremes. More to the point, the jump in the put/call is too fresh and new. Baycrest Partners technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky says the **10-day moving average for the ratio is only now edging out of what he considers complacency**. And while the breadth of the decline has been overly negative -- for example, 98% of S&P 500 stocks fell yesterday following a 97% down day on Monday -- the ARMS index is tame. **The selling has not displayed the ‚Äúirrational behavior‚Äù** that BMO technical analyst Russ Visch is looking for. Lastly, the generals of the rally are usually the last to go. The three-session downdraft in the S&P 500 has been led - on a percentage basis - by energy stocks, not technology (though it does come in second). **The relative buoyancy of computer and software names is not comforting**, as MLIV colleague Cameron Crise noted in his post on a lack of capitulation yesterday. **The takeaway: the bottom is most likely not in yet.**|2020-02-26 08:29:28

Azar gave the 30 million number when talking to the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday.  Today he clarified it like this:  "We have 30 million surgical masks. Those would be the gauze tied behind the ear-type masks meant to really protect people from the healthcare workers spreading. We have 12 million N95 NIOSH-certified masks in the stockpile and we have about 5 million N95 masks that I believe may have expired, they're no longer NIOSH-certified.‚Äù   Azar did not go into detail about what an expired mask means, or whether it can still be used. NIOSH refers to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.  Azar explained that N95 masks are ‚Äúmostly for health care workers.‚Äù   When asked if the public should access N95 masks, Azar said, "No no, we do not recommend that. We do not recommend that, no,‚Äù adding the best defense is basic public health hygiene ‚Äî washing hands for an extended period of time, not touching your face and coughing into your elbow.  Still, he said the stockpile is not enough. ‚ÄúWhat we have talked about is approximately 300 million additional N95 masks from the emergency supplemental," Azar said.|2020-02-26 11:38:31
