id5swv|qhjkuz|qhjkuz|9|*Joe Lonsdale, a founder of Palantir Technologies Inc. and a prolific venture capitalist, stoked a debate on Twitter about parental leave, saying any prominent man who takes six months off with his newborn is “a loser.”*   I never took six months off, and I’m lucky enough to work from home and have the chilliest job in the world – can set my own hours, don’t deal with meetings, etc. I’ve talked to many friends and colleagues who have had kids, many who worked long hours to earn more money to afford the bigger house for their family. With their kids older now, pretty much all of them say they wish they spent more time at home and that the money wasn’t worth it in theend. You can’t buy back time with your baby growing up, and those are precious moments. I’ve been so lucky to be the first to see my son crawl and walk because I was at home. And I think my son is already better off because he’s had both of his parents at home way more than either of us did growing up, especially when you factor in the pandemic and the lost time he’s had with his grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc. Americans are truly fucked when itcomes to maternal/parental leave (as well as vacation time in general). No wonder people are generally apathetic and dealing with existential angst all the time.  TLDR: Calls on PLTR. Puts on Joe’s family life.  |2021-10-28 05:45:27

It's all the same anyway, and now with fractional shares the argument that the "common man" can't buy doesn't hold for most stocks, (brk.a excluded).   Is the idea that in a year or two people will "forget" it split and it will "reset". So today if x happens it goes up a dollar. Tomorrow after a 2-1 split if x happens it goes up 50 cents. But maybe in a year or two if x happens it will go up a dollar again, because the world sort of reset on to the new normal?  Otherwise I don't see any benefits, except I'll own 2 times as many shares that are half as valuable. I guess that could move someone into covered calls category if they previously had 50 and now have 100.|2021-10-28 11:18:42

Every day when the guy left for work his wife would sleep in for another hour or two I noticed. One day I snuck onto the front porch and checked the door and confirmed my suspicion that this guy was leaving the door unlocked. So a few days later when he left for work I walked up, went in their house, quietly searched around until I found the bedroom with his wife sleeping in it, and nutted all over her sleeping face.
