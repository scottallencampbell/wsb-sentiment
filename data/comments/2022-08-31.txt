Without fail I‚Äôve made the worst possible moves since opening a brokerage account in may. I‚Äôve  wasted months worth of my shitty income.   At least a couple people will laugh before this gets lost in the sands of the thread moving on. Looking forward to taking my 30% smaller (if I‚Äôm lucky) account balance out. Selling everything, Putting it all in a saving account, being broke, never owning anything, and continuing my miserable existence.  I‚Äôm sure others are worse off; but goddamn‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Kudos to everyone who got out/ has puts today.

mixjbp|x29l12|x29l12|7|Stopped listening for the crowd, analyzed fundamentals and bought 8000k NYSE:X at **$23.38.**   While everyone is pointing to companies with PE of higher than 15 I got the one with PE 1.6.   It has no dept and keeps running buybacks.    According to Benjamin Graham rules the company worth about $57 a share.    They have total assets 30% then it's capitalization. Look up the fundamentals and tell me if I am wrong.     Here is my analysis a few days ago.     NYSE:X Current stock price: $24.89     Current P/E ratio: 1.45 Earnings Per Share: 3.86 Total Equity: 9,103M     Shares Outstanding: 237,226,996 https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/X/key-statistics/    Book value per share (BVPS) = (Total Equity-Preferred Equity) / Shares Outstanding I could not find Preferred Stocks for this company, so I would assume those were not issued, thus will not be included in my calculations.     **Book value per share (BVPS) = 9,103,000,000/237,226,996 = $38.37**     According to Benjamin Graham formula a fair stock price is calculated: Fair price per share = SQRT( 22.5√ó (Earnings Per Share) √ó (Book Value Per Share) )     **Fair price per share = SQRT(22.5√ó 3.86 x 38.37) = $57.7**|2022-08-31 09:24:39

mjdvso|x29l12|x29l12|6|The 12 million shares offered by BBBY is only the beginning.  It is a supplement to the S-3, which actually governs how many shares that can be sold.   In that document, the limitation on shares is 900 million.  The company can cut and paste this 12 million share supplement, and file a new one just like it to sell 100 million more any time it wants.   Now that the S-3 is in effect, it literally now takes minutes for them to sell as many shares as they want.In other words, squeeze, impossible.    No way it gets above $20 again.   And it won't liquidate new shorts until it hits $30.  Until then, it is a game led by liars who sell when they say they buy.  Ponzi schemes are not new.|2022-08-31 11:11:11

I think once they realize what‚Äôs happening you‚Äôll start seeing an exodus from ETF‚Äôs to bonds for the ‚Äúsafer‚Äù play.

mk55xj|x29l12|x29l12|6|UK inflation predicted to be 18%.  Germany facing double digit inflation, and they're already turning out the lights and turning off hot water to conserve energy due to the looming energy crisis.  All of EU is staring down the barrel of an energy crisis.  China's economy has now been described as 'disturbingly weak' (https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-economy-manufacturing-51661933781?tesla=y). China has severe droughts all over and a massive heat wave that is forcing them to shut down factories etc.  Couple all of that with continued COVID lockdowns, and the world's manufacturing center will continue to fuck supply chains. Who the fuck is going to buy iPhone 14s and Teslas when China's economy slips into a massive recession...and oh yeah, their property sector problems still are fucked.  We got food prices skyrocketing everywhere. The price of natural gas has exploded and will inflict tons of pain in the winter.  Mortgage applications are precipitously falling as interest rates skyrocket. Property values may fall as well, hitting wealth effects harder.  Many Wall Street companies reporting weak earnings and lowered guidance.  Inflation is still sticking around and we have a hawkish fed.  USD is destroying currencies and the threat of a currency crisis somewhere in the world is now very real.  Oh yeah, and the Russian War still hasn't gone away, and we got more tensions with China/Taiwan.    Can we just admit we are fooked?  The markets need to lose 70% from ATHs in 2021 in order to hit the reset button and get rid of all of the excess that has been pumped into assets since 2009.  SPY 280 plz.|2022-08-31 14:05:11

mje2hj|x29l12|x29l12|2|Forget about a soft landing. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now aiming for something much more painful for the economy to put an end to elevated inflation. The trouble is, even that may not be enough.   It‚Äôs known to economists by the paradoxical name of a ‚Äúgrowth recession.‚Äù Unlike a soft landing, it‚Äôs a protracted period of meager growth and rising unemployment. But it stops short of an outright contraction of the economy.    Powell ‚Äúburied the concept of a soft landing‚Äù with his Aug. 26 speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG LLP. Now, ‚Äúthe Fed‚Äôs goal is to grind inflation down by slowing growth below its potential,‚Äù which officials peg at 1.8%.|2022-08-31 11:12:22

mjh4s9|x29l12|x29l12|2|Morgan Stanley: Retail investors net bought an estimated $1.4bn of equities on the week (< 20th%ile vs the last year and since 2016). That was largely from single-name net demand of $1.6bn as self-directed retail traders were marginally more active at the aggregate level this week. Broad-based ETFs were net bought to the tune of $700mm, but was more than offset by $900mm of supply across sector-focused ETFs. Despite higher activity on the week within single-names, demand has consistently been muted at the aggregate level over the last month with total net demand flat ($1.1bn on a rolling 1m basis, 24th%ile vs the last year) and the standard deviation of daily net retail demand at only the $630mm ‚Äì that‚Äôs the lowest level since November 2021 and represents the 10th%ile vs the last year.  Financials was the most net bought sector on the week at $775mm, followed by Comm Services with 1/3rd the size at $330mm. Discretionary single-names were the most net sold at $450mm. Tech was the 2nd most netsol sector but largely from ETF supply.|2022-08-31 11:31:42

Bed Bath & Beyond Corp., et al., Case No. 2:22-cv-02541, asserts claims of breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of ¬ß¬ß 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of our securities from March 25, 2022 through August 18, 2022. The Complaint alleges that certain of our disclosures about the Company‚Äôs revenue and proposed divestments, as well as other disclosures made by certain of our investors about their holdings, during the putative class period were materially false or misleading. The Company is in the early stages of evaluating the complaint, but ***based on current knowledge the Company believes the claims are without merit.***  &#x200B;  ü§°ü§°BBBY says claims are without merit So ThEY MuST bE FalSE!! ü§°ü§°|2022-08-31 14:37:31

These shipping costs were incurred by the company or passed onto consumers. The dropping rates will result in increased margins for companies and lower prices of goods for consumers.

mj7so4|x29l12|x29l12|1|Point 1‚Äì Banks may use the excess liquidity during QE to make loans, including those like margin debt used for speculative purposes. During QT, however, they may not reduce their loan book, thus effectively reducing net liquidity available to others. Point 2‚Äì Banks, understanding that liquidity is declining, may ‚Äúhoard‚Äù excess liquidity. Such actions reduce system-wide liquidity. Point 3‚Äì Liquidity is allocated poorly during QE. When removed, it can have unequal stress on Treasury markets, where banks rely heavily on liquidity to maintain balanced two-way flows. Point 4‚Äì During QE, banks tend to loan money for shorter time periods. This can be for speculative purposes and short-term loans. In many cases, the short loans need to roll over once they mature. With QT draining liquidity, stress can occur as the borrowers may struggle to borrow to pay off the original loans. Such can result in the forced liquidation of assets to repay the original loan.|2022-08-31 10:31:51

mjmv0l|x29l12|x29l12|0|Ok, I'm torn on what to do. Here are my options:     I have some TQQQ 35 Calls for October 21st, currently down a bit so my thoughts are to sell weekly calls using my long calls as one leg. But I'm torn on what to do with the premium:     1) DCA down my existing 35 Calls for October 21st  2) Roll my calls out to November 18.  I'm kind of leaning for #2 because I can continue to sell weeklies for longer if I have to. The debate arises because it will cost money to roll them out, vs. just DCA'ing down on my existing ones to allow for me to collect profits on those at a much lower cost.  What do you folks think?|2022-08-31 12:08:07
