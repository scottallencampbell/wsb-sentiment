7bv3qp|ui32yd|ui32yd|7|We rally, then next time he will say we looking at 0.75-1% then market tanks again, then fomc he says we will do 0.25 next round. JPow is always bullish look at that old boomer you think he will retire with a red market?|2022-05-04 14:13:35

7akawk|ui32yd|ui32yd|9|I think we all have to come to grips with if today’s Fed announcement comes out and we really start falling off the proverbial cliff. The recession talks will really ramp up and I hope we don’t start a cascading event down. Bear markets are brutal, a lot of people haven’t really experienced them. They can destroy wealth, they are long and usually drawn out. But just know at the bottom of the cascading event you can buy everything cheap af. Just play it smart, don’t over leverage. Buy on the way down at every major level. Major indexes at down 20%, 40%, etc.. don’t panic the market can’t go to zero, we all have much bigger problems if something like that happens.|2022-05-04 09:02:06

7btuaf|ui32yd|ui32yd|3|>Amid the market's slide, stock investors have reached new levels of pessimism. Bearish sentiment, which are expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months, rose sharply to 59.4% in the latest survey by the American Association of Individual Investors. The last time bearish sentiment went above that level was in March 2009 during the financial crisis.  >Such weak sentiment can be a contrary positive indicator for stocks. The net spread in the AAII survey between bulls and bears fell to negative 43 percentage points in the latest survey, with a four-week average of negative 29 percentage points.  >Since 1987, when such an average four-week spread has been below negative 10 percentage points, the S&P 500 has risen 15.5% on average over the next 12 months, according to RBC Capital Markets.  - Reuters this morning|2022-05-04 14:05:18

7bsyqr|ui32yd|ui32yd|8|Those of you expecting a crash don't understand the elasticity of the market in response to volatility. Hedge funds hedge - they protect against unexpected shocks. When there's uncertainty and risk, like a 75 bps hike, they hedge against that, just in case.   It doesn't matter that everyone knew shit was bad. Hedges were worried it was even worse than expected. Now that things are as expected, they're unwinding their short term protections, causing the melt up.   If you want to trade FOMC, you need to know how to ride the unwind.

7avyn5|ui32yd|ui32yd|5|Here’s a scenario for the meeting today…they come out with a hawkish surprise, either on the rate or the pace of QT. Market inexplicably buys it up tho off the letter release, similar to how it sold off following the letter release in March. This is confusing but it ends up being dumb retail money flowing in expecting the same pop we got last time just on the removal of uncertainty. This continues up until Powell starts speaking when he underscores the hawkish perspective and retail realizes the smart money isn’t flooding in behind them to buy, slowing the pace of the rally until it ultimately reverses, sending us cascading to new lows.  A huge amount of what ifs but in that scenario shorting the beginning of the speech would yield massive gains. And even if the rally continues you have very limited risk. Just cut if whatever resistance you get in against breaks.|2022-05-04 10:21:27

7ai79q|ui32yd|ui32yd|2|Do y'all ever play the "woulda coulda shoulda" thing?  I had an option on stupid $AAPL that was expiring on Friday. I picked it up I think Monday. I paid $350 for it and it immediately dropped down to like $25. For the last few days, I've watched it bounce between $25 and $50 and I didn't feel like closing it and taking $30 for it cuz honestly, that's basically the same as letting it expire worthless. So this morning, at open, I put a limit order to close it and I asked for $70.   It sold about 2 minutes later for $70 and now I'm wondering what would've happened if I just asked for a bit more. Heck, maybe if I had hung around I could've gotten it back to what I paid and not lost anything. Or even made a few bucks.  How much time do you spend on checking the value of things you don't own anymore? Just to see if you made a mistake that you could maybe learn from?|2022-05-04 08:46:43

'Soft landing' is as much bullshit as inflation is transitory, due to the supply chain, and due to corporate greed.   Dead cat bounces are the most epic. 12 of the top 20 Nasdaq 1-day rallies happened during the 78% drop from 2000’s top. 9 of the top 20 S&P 500 1-day rallies happened during the 86% drop from the 1929 top.

7aakb0|ui32yd|ui32yd|3|ADP #s show the labor market is tighter than expected.  The gap between number of jobs offered and job seekers keeps widening. JPow needs to be more hawkish than expected because the labor market  remains extremely tight and wage growth is mooning. It is leading to more and more permanent inflation. It is paradoxical, because while all of the wage growth sounds like a good thing for the middle class, real wages are actually falling behind inflation. It is cost-push inflation, which is a much more beastly problem than trying to cool off inflation due to excess demand.  Last week's ECI #s came in the highest in the history of the index. That also follows over 11% PPI.  We are now caught in a cycle of high inflation -> workers demand higher salary -> workers can get more salary because they have leverage in this extremely tight labor market -> high wages and higher input costs get passed down to consumers by companies with pricing power. The cycle repeats over and over and over again and is very difficult to break. JPow has also publicly cited ECI data as being important for influencing fed policy.  Companies that do not have pricing power will start to get obliterated due to our of control labor costs and costs for inputs.  They will have to start laying people off if margins start compressing. Labor and wages that are pushing up inflation are the biggest problem now, despite the story they want to push about CPI and PCE having peaked. Real wages, which are now negative, has always been massively influential on Fed policy.  Jpow may be frostier than expected. I wouldn't get comfortable yet.|2022-05-04 07:46:36

7atyhu|ui32yd|ui32yd|2|Jesus Christ......so many you permabulls are delusional.  Even if JPow comes in line and the market has a nice rally, the top is likely near 4400-4500. Wow, congrats still a loss for the year.  This will not end without a recession. Anyone who thinks the Fed can thread the needle for a soft landing probably believed inflation was transitory too.  Nope, we may get a bull run or two, but this is primed for a hard landing and inflation won't go away until there is a nasty recession. So much hopium on the insane idea that you can have a pro-growth environment while bringing down 40 year high inflation.  The labor market is too hot and GDP is still OK.  The economy can take a good whack from the Fed to rein this shit in. The stock market no longer matters.|2022-05-04 10:08:10

7am6m7|ui32yd|ui32yd|-2|lol.   I tried to tell you about AMD.  Sell the news.  Semis have topped out, but all I got was nasty replies.  Look at the charts for semis...they've all increased by multiples already over the last 2 years.  So much growth has already been priced in, yet you permabulls think they have multiples more to run.  Even with the outstanding ER, look at AMD. struggling to get above $100, which is about 10% below where it was just 2-3 weeks ago, and 40% down from ATH.  You're literally trying to buy at the top and trying to squeeze blood from a stone.  That's the problem buying shit in which so much growth has already been priced in. Even after massive earnings beats, the stocks don't go anywhere because companies just cannot keep up with expectations that have already been pulled forward.|2022-05-04 09:15:31

Every time he's faced with a choice between doing the right thing and doing nothing and keeping the party going, he's turned the music up louder.  In March they finally hiked after YEARS and then only by 25 bps. Every single economic indicator has been screaming for higher rates for years and he delivered...25 bps...

Should I be worried..? I don’t like that it’s only down a little bit.. actually I’m pissed off. Should I sell?  Edit: NFLX dropping 5% avg/day not value of my puts.

Confirmed drivers at highest level since pandemic started.  Unlike LYFT, they do not need to increase driver incentives to entice drivers.  Expected to turn a profit before year end.  Also, rideshare revenue now bigger than Eats.  The only negative is the DiDi investment tanking, which has been a known quantity for 3 quarters now.  Yet the stock is currently down 11%.
