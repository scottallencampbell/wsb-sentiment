m4j7pz|fsxqpm|fsxqpm|26|If you're expecting big unemployment numbers tomorrow, it might not pan out for your puts. Here's some local DD from NC -  I laid off 45 people when my restaurant was forced to temporarily close. 5 full timers and 40 part timers. Out of those 45, maybe 30 have filed claims. The remaining 15 are too lazy to bother getting free money. Seriously. The NC unemployment website is a disaster and it's taking people hours to get it to go all the way through the steps to file.   Out of the 30 that have filed, I have received and approved 20 claims (I have to certify that they were laid off and not fired for misconduct or job abandonment to expedite their claims).  Out of those 20 claims I have approved, at least 12, including myself, have gotten delayed due to "cannot verify social security number". The people who are rejected this way are asked to take their social security card to the unemployment office in person (great for social distancing, right). Only two of the 12 have actually done this.   So, out of 45 layoffs, only 30 (66%) have filed for unemployment, and only 10 (22%) have actually been approved for benefits. I don't know at what point they become initial jobless claims (is it when they apply, when they are approved, or when they actually receive a check).   I bet this is a transparent attempt to show lower unemployment numbers. If this type of fuckery is going on in every state, the unemployment numbers are being VASTLY underreported.   Point is, don't count on initial jobless claims to help your puts too much tomorrow.|2020-04-01 10:32:47

From the sound of it, we were and still are woefully underprepared to handle what is to come. Lives are being torn apart as people are dying alone in the hospital because visitors are no longer allowed in. Employees who show symptoms and are waiting for test results to come back are told to come in to work in the mean time. People who show mild symptoms are not even being tested, just turned away and told to stay home. Shit will get wayyy more scary before it will get better.

For example, Starbucks will not lay-off for 30 days.  The point is that this will be a downward spiral as companies lay-off. Consumer spending will be reduced and causing companies to do more lay-offs. $1200 is way too little to keep the economy running.

With riots everywhere, going outside was almost suicide. But who cares? North Korea had launched a nuke. It would be here in a few minutes. I went outside and stood in the middle of the street.  Just for shits, I decided to take out my phone, and give Robinhood one more look over. I look at my puts. All of them up 100,000%. At least I could die rich. Then there was rumbling and the sound of whistling. The nuke was here. Not much time left. Hastily, I hit sell on my put with a smile. I can die rich.  And as the wall of fire hit me, Robinhood responds with, "Cannot place order at this time."|2020-04-01 16:20:49

Since its in a 401k I only have level 0 options - cash secured puts, covered calls, married puts.  I have 100 shares, a short call, and a long put.  I was like, are you sure?  I believe I have a collared position on BA.  Trade desk replied back and apologized, acknowledged that I do in fact have a collar on BA.  I just want everyone to know that I'm probably the first WSB'r to have Schwab's trading desk email back and say they were wrong about my position.

Apr 9 options have decent low IV premiums on call side (but crazy high on put side). Apr 3 options have decent IV on put side.

m4y2hb|fsxqpm|fsxqpm|4|Advice from a jaded gay bear: Stay cash gang overnight, now is the time to strategize your day trades.  Reason: This market WILL NOT act rationally. It is impossible to tell what news is priced in or not at this point, and on top of this, the Fed has promised (and proven) that it will intervene without notice in the face of significant downturn. We could get horrible news at 5pm today, after-market/futures/pre-market could crash, and we'd still get pegged by JPow's giant green dildo tomorrow morning.  You can time a rational market, but this is NOT a rational market. The rules these prices are following are hidden to us, and if you think you have a good reason to expect a certain movement, you WILL be proven wrong. Trying to predict what this market will do based on traditional reasoning is like playing Monopoly by the rules of Candy Land: You by-definition cannot win, and if you do, it will be an accident.  People say that historically a retest is inevitable, but this isn't 1929. Our federal government has made it explicitly clear that they will PRINT AS MUCH MONEY AND BUY WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO to stop the market from crashing. Yes, it should crash, and yes your puts should print. But put your autism on hold for a second and contemplate the possibility that JPow does not give a shit about you, and will print a trillion $ just to keep the market trading sideways.  TLDR: Our federal government cares more about securing wealth for the top than it does for the entire nation's health, and they won't hesitate for a second to print another trillion to prevent another downturn. If you think you're clever for holding the (correct) position that the market should retest the bottom, just think about how clever those companies you're betting against feel knowing they have a fucking DOLLAR PRINTING MACHINE watching their backs.|2020-04-01 12:40:53

Over the past few days I have opened a few shorts; LVS and WYNN a last week and CCL just yesterday. Waaaay up on all of them and they pretty much keep my portfolio green. Don't have to worry about time and volatility, just direction. Strongly recommend.  &#x200B;  Still have about 100k left in non-margin buying power, any of you guys have good SHORT ideas that still have a healthy downside potential?|2020-04-01 09:51:25

m5ckhv|fsxqpm|fsxqpm|1|Okay, lets see if I did this correctly:  Owned 100 shares of $F that I purchased for $4.40/share.  Sold a single 4/3 $4.5c for $0.13/share.\\  worst case scenario is $F plummeting and my shares becoming worthless in which case at lease I have $13 more than I would have if I sell the worthless shares.  Most likely case is that my contract will be exercised in a day or two which means I will have made $23 profit and lost my position in $F  Second most likely scenario is that the contract expires worthless and I made enough money to buy a burger in addition to being ashamed of owning 100 shares of $F.

m5a3tc|fsxqpm|fsxqpm|-6|Be gentle, new to options and I made a rookie mistake. I lost track of time last night and didn't get my spy put in before the market closed. I missed the put for $242 at around $2.60 and the market dropped on reopening and I acted quickly thinking I was buying the same thing but it was at $232 strike. In the rush to get skin in the game I fucked up. Now all I can think about it is the one I missed for the same price with a $10 higher strike. Truth is, I'm learning so I'm only playing around with one contract at a time. Still I'm not keen on missing out on that $1000 difference. I assume there is no shortage of people who missed out of far more money than this because they made a mistake. How do you deal with the urge to punch yourself in the face?|2020-04-01 14:25:26
