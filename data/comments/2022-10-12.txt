s1td82|y1zscn|y1zscn|12|Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement    For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT        Share    Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.        Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.        The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3-1/4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.        In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.        Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Esther L. George; Philip N. Jefferson; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.        Implementation Note issued September 21, 2022|2022-10-12 13:05:44

We could always -- if we needed to -- reverse what we’re doing, if we thought that inflation was headed back down very, very quickly,”    “For me, the bar for such a change is very high because we have not yet seen much evidence that the underlying inflation -- the services inflation, the wage inflation, the labor market -- that that is yet softening,”    “I think we’re quite a ways away from anything like that,” referring to the idea of a policy pivot. “I think a much more likely scenario is we will raise to some level north of 4% -- maybe 4.5% -- and then pause and sit there for an extended period of time while the tightening we’ve already done works its way through the economy.”|2022-10-12 11:46:41

s0r6zj|y1zscn|y1zscn|3|Regarding AMD and NVDA, one of the things I like to do when buying a stock that's falling is to break it up into 40-30-30 so when I think it's low I use 40% of what I set aside for it, if it goes up from there I buy with 30% of what I set aside and let it continue to grow from there.  But if it falls after buying with 40% I buy with the 30% and then wait again to see if it falls lower, if it does, boom sti have 30% left to buy with.  My movement margins for that is like 10% of stock value change, otherwise that's just fluctuations to me|2022-10-12 08:49:31

s0k21h|y1zscn|y1zscn|4|High PPI doesn't automatically mean higher CPI, although PPI can effect CPI.  Not all companies can just pass through higher costs, so some of the PPI comes out of margins, especially with inventories as high as they are.  Companies still have to generate revenue albeit at a lower margin.  High PPI doesn't bode well for future earnings though, there should be some repricing to adjust for lower future earnings, unless it got priced in already.|2022-10-12 07:53:16

They're going to have to devalue their currency, and their status will drop a peg for our lifetime. A resource starved, snobby little island. The arrogance. The hubris...   Make no mistake, you know when shit hits the fan here, the feds will do the same, to allow the rich to exit a little more gracefully using the taxes levied on the poors... and give announcement like the BoE did to "sell, get out of your positions in 3 days" .   The rich will ALWAYS be allowed to exit their bag holding positions. Always. So what does that mean for us?  Live. Live a little more, take such outsized risk in the next cycle that would make Burry and Warren Buffet blush. That would make Elon Musk and Bezos blush in the risk taking.   Greed and risk taking is the only thing rewarded in this life.   Go, and do what you must.  TL/DR: buy puts. Scale in long term buys at the next large drop ( 10%)|2022-10-12 09:58:15

s1hte9|y1zscn|y1zscn|5|Is it time to buy calls right now? No. There is plenty of volatility and CPI is tomorrow.  When then? After October/November earnings, so that companies are properly priced in relation to the effects of inflation.  Why? As we head into 2023, the Fed will reach their target rate after the first quarter or so. They will **pause** rate hikes and observe to see if enough demand destruction cools inflation down.  What does that mean? Very likely a rally starting in December/January.  Note: this is all invalidated if inflation keeps rising.|2022-10-12 11:50:37

Way to fund the economy with that stimulus money you've been taking.  Holding strong on my calls and keeping them at this rate.

There is even an entire economic theory, known as “cost-push inflation,” that stems from it. Problem is, the data don’t back it up.  **As you probably also noticed, PPI almost always runs higher and is more volatile than CPI**—a fact that hopefully brings further comfort today. We delved into the reasons for this in our “What We’re Reading” sidebar today, but in short, PPI focuses on goods prices, which tend to swing much more than services. CPI, by contrast, is about 60% services.  ![img](emotet5_2th5218630)![img](emotet5_2th5218630)![img](emotet5_2th5218630)![img](emotet5_2th5218630)![img](emotet5_2th5218630) copium straight into my veins|2022-10-12 07:58:43

s12ll0|y1zscn|y1zscn|1|Hi guys, I'm new here. I heard about this forum back when the game stop thing happened. My best friend works on a deep-sea mining ship. They were attempting to mine minerals for batteries, something that was never done before at those depths. They finally made it. Yesterday he send me the video of the actual stones rolling into the ship. This morning the first news came out but the stock just went up a little bit. I think this is historic and is going under the radar. I don't know if this is the right place to post, please advise. Here is the link of the news. Thanks!  https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/3013-nasdaq/tmc/129335-tmc-and-allseas-achieve-historic-milestone-nodules-collected-from-the-seafloor-and-lifted-to-the-production-vessel-using-4-km-riser-during-pilot-trials-in-the-clarion-clipperton-zone-for-first-time-since-the-1970s.html|2022-10-12 10:10:02

There are 4 types of red-green color blindness:        Deuteranomaly is the most common type of red-green color blindness. It makes green look more red. This type is mild and doesn’t usually get in the way of normal activities.    Protanomaly makes red look more green and less bright. This type is mild and usually doesn’t get in the way of normal activities.

sa773s|y1zscn|y1zscn|1|A curious case.![gif](emotefree_emotes_packdownvote)  What do you think about those **shares that have one or very few reference shareholders and that control almost the totality of the company**? They are usually quite stable shares, although the minority shareholders could hardly change the price of the companies, and would end up selling when, after some time, and bored by not seeing the price rise, they would throw in the towel and sell their shares. I do not know many of these companies, but I have recently come across one, and it is an animal (literally).  I am referring to the Spanish stock **Squirrel Media (SQRL), ISIN ES0183304080**, and I have been analyzing it for a few weeks (yes, you read that right, it is named like the animal that eats nuts and climbs trees, is it meant to be a metaphor?).  Now I want to tell you what I have discovered about this company.This stock is listed in the Spanish market and has a very big peculiarity: its CEO and one and only majority shareholder, owns, either directly or through his holding company Squirrel Capital, 96% of the shares of this company. The last time he declared the amount of shares he owned in this company was in 2020, and he already owned 92%. Subsequently he has been buying back, mostly minority shares, and declaring those small purchases until he increased his position to 96%.  This company has a total number of issued shares of 89 million, so its owner owns 85.44 million shares, and therefore its free-float is a ridiculous 3.56 million.All this can be checked on the website of the Spanish regulator CNMV (Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, cnmv.es). I can´t put any images but below is the link to the Squirrel page and you can check it there. [https://www.cnmv.es/Portal/Consultas/DatosEntidad.aspx?nif=A84856947&lang=en](https://www.cnmv.es/Portal/Consultas/DatosEntidad.aspx?nif=A84856947&lang=en)  If you check the percentages, he has bought 40% of the shares since May 2019 until now, especially since March 26, 2020 (36%), in a price range between 2.81 and 4.34. And the previous ones it has at higher prices.  The share is trading right now almost at historical lows (2.80), only surpassed in March 2020 for health reasons already known.  It seems that the owner and maximum shareholder of the company wants to keep the whole company only by buying the daily drip of sales of shares of retailers, who fed up with seeing how the company does not go up, decide to declare losses and leave with what is left of their money elsewhere.  It is a stock that moves very few shares daily exactly for the reasons already mentioned, and you know that some days it only moves 1 (1!) share.  As an example, at the end of January 2022, where it went **from trading at 3.18 to 3.89 in one week moving only 10,000 shares!**![gif](emotefree_emotes_packupvote)  Well friends, just to let you know that this stock is **like a squirrel**!!!! ;)![img](emotet5_2th524270)|2022-10-14 07:55:53
