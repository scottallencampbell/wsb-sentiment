Stop making excuses. Stop being so fat. Fix your hernia so you can workout. Get the nice car. Smell good. Be fun to be around. Have good stories. Get your teeth fixed. Breathe through your nose. Do everything in your power not to be a pussy. Talk about shit you really love it'll seem genuine. Mention that you are a well-known Elder on the largest financial forum in the world. Ask her to sign a consent form and make her wonder if you really keep one on you at all time. Draw attention to your erect penis with a lighthearted joke. At that point you just have to bring her home to the room you have covered in plastic and get to business.

In a statement on GoFundMe, the workers alliance said many events have caused the alliance "to initiate a work stoppage until demands are met and worker representation is finally given a place within the company."        The alliance also said the donation effort will help offset wages lost from the work stoppage.        The strike fund has topped $100,000 from nearly 1,600 donations in over 14 hours, while the goal is to raise $1 million, GoFundMe data show.        Shares of the video game publisher fluctuated in Thursday trading.        Price: 58.59, Change: -0.68, Percent Change: -1.15        MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Like how does this company have anything good going for it. The only argument I've seen is "it's already gone down a lot" but analysts still seem to be bullish.

Give me two years mandatory military service for all Americans aged 21 years, men and women, and I will show you a nation stronger than all the other nations. Love God, and love your neighbor as yourself; this is the command of the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords we celebrate this Christmas.
