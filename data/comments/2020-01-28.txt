ftkdhm|ev46l5|ev46l5|14|My predictions for this week:  1. Coronavirus continues to spread at an alarming rate, however the news headlines stop caring because they have the memory and attention span of a goldfish. People regularly dying of coronavirus becomes a normal thing. People die every day and stonks don't care because they be stonkin' 2. However, stonks do care about earnings. I predict that most earnings *will* beat on revenue and guidance, yet they will still go down, much to the pikachuface of bulls. Guidance will still indicate an economic slowdown and remind shareholders that their shit is overbought. Massive profit taking ensues. 3. I predict the Fed will keep rates the same, and they will express a desire to gradually lessen their repo assistance and QE, so as not to cause an equities bubble. As the extra liquidity drains away, the market will snap back to reality and ope there goes gravity.|2020-01-28 08:47:00

fu7w3u|ev46l5|ev46l5|5|Ok y‚Äôall listen up. Apple ER is VERY convoluted this go ‚Äòround so personally, I will be day trading after the announcement tomorrow morning and not holding overnight on a ‚Äúprayer‚Äù either which way.  The Good: Q4 revenue and sales absolutely will kill expectations. People could not buy enough fruit this past holiday season. AirPods were nowhere to be found, even the laptops and desktops were sold out lots of places. Anyone who didn‚Äôt already have an iWatch who wanted a tracking device also scooped one this past quarter.  The Bad: guidance will not be great, China has gone dark, no real upside from here in terms of innovation/hype until later this year.  I think IC is the way to go. 335/295 and just collect some premium if you really *need* to have money in the market on this one.   If that‚Äôs too complicated for you and you want a simple upsies or downsies, *go with puts* because the market cares more about the future than the past and the outlook for Apple though great, will be uncertain at best in terms of trying to duplicate the Q4 EPS.   Oh wait one last thing, I have ONE rule and one rule only: Never under any circumstance bet against Apple. So calls it is.|2020-01-28 12:32:29

funp3w|ev46l5|ev46l5|2|Foolproof money printing method (I use a Dow derivative)  \-  Wait for a daily low point-  Buy a tiny low risk long position set stop loss level at 0.5% of your total capital-  Wait for that position to be in modest profit (e.g. 50 points up e.g.)- Set guaranteed stop loss on open position at 1 point profit- Buy another position, also tiny.- Repeat whilst market is rising, so you only ever have one position that might make a loss- After market has risen around 200-250 dow points, sel, for a profit, all but the last open position.- At this point, experience says that market has a high chance of correcting slightly and going down, if it continues up, start a new round of opening positions.  PROS  \- You only ever have one position that could lose a max of 0.5%- No trying to guess the market direction as you only go long...if it goes up, you win, if it goes down significantly or crashes, congratulations, you got yourself a whole new fresh range of cheap buying opportunities.  \-E.g. Fridays correction down to yesterdays opening values created fantastic BTD opportunities.  CONS  \- Profits are small and steady...maybe 3-6% a week growth, varying...some weeks can be frustratingly flat.- No 1000% gainz in 2hours  More PROS  \- No 95% losses in 2 hours.  With a portfolio of ¬£20k/$20k you can make yourself a tidy monthly side income and do all those fun things you've wanted to (buy a yacht, learn to fly, travel etc.).
