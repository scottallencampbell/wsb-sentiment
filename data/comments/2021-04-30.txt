wess2j|n1qned|n1qned|14|Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street. Small caps seeing the worst of it with the Russell 2000 off about 0.6%. Nasdaq is down about 0.5%, the S&P 500 by about 0.4% and Dow 0.3% lower.  Commodities and bonds are being sold off a bit as well. Crude oil down 1.5%. 10-year yields up to 1.647% That‚Äôs as of 0625.  The selling appears driven primarily by Covid concerns. Rising cases in India and Brazil. New variants. How many times have we seen this story? The toll in India appears to be serious from a humanitarian viewpoint. But the global economy has demonstrated it can adopt to quarantines and shutdowns  Inflation may be a concern as well but that appears secondary in this morning‚Äôs activity. I say that mainly due to commodities prices dropping. And the bond sell-off is not particularly serious at all.  But watch for more inflation concerns in the personal income expenditures and income reports for March, due out at 0830. This is the preferred gauge watched by the Fed (more than CPI). The PCE is expected to be 0.2% higher MoM. If the number exceeds that then the inflation drum will start to beat, perhaps loudly.   That, more than anything, will move the Fed to taper and eventually tighten. And that, more than anything, will put an end to the bull market.  We are also due to get quarterly earnings from Chevron and Exxon Mobil before the open. Consumer staples Clorox and Colgate-Palmolive report during market hours.|2021-04-30 05:51:44

Large risks on the horizon are potential rate hikes, inflation, tapering, disease flare-ups, and recession from these massive GDP numbers. The market is hanging in the balance right now without much catalyst or directionality. Any movement lately seems very reactionary and temporary.

wfp61e|n1qned|n1qned|8|I've been smoking a lot of weed with 4/20, Earth Day, and SPY hitting $420 all in a short amount of time. There has been much to celebrate. Whilst blazed I enjoyed the classic stoner flick "Grandma's Boy" where Dante references the strain "The Brown Bomber" which gets you so high you shit your pants. Then it occurred to me. More people smoking to celebrate = more people getting so high they shit their pants = increased underwear sales. Hanes earnings 5/11.

wezy7z|n1qned|n1qned|4|MVIS bag holder checking in.  I listened to the entire call.  So boring.  Earnings sucked but that was expected. However it was also expected that they announce an acquisition or partnership which did NOT happen!  They simply went from saying they were "exploring options" to negotiating potentials... and wouldn't comment further.  They are also under NDA with customers and cant say shit about shit. They have a customer that pre paid 10M and once they fulfill that qty the customer will buy more.  So basically the earnings reported no news other than they completed a test production line to prove to potential partners that their product can be mass produced (which is good!) and their product innovation is promising.  Rumors are still acquisition by Microsoft, Google or NVIDIA (MSFT Hololens 2 uses their tech and now their focus is self driving cars etc) but no one knows when...  Edit: they did make it clear that their main focus is shareholder value and future acquisition! Most promising part of the call.   So do I buy the dip and wait for acquisition or take my loss and move on? Decisions decisions...but I tend to hold.|2021-04-30 07:07:32

Buy Jan ‚Äò23 calls 30-50% OTM. Wait patiently. Once you start seeing gains set your stop losses and get out no worse than 20% profit. Take your profit and initial investment and watch the ticker closely; buy Dec ‚Äò21 puts 15-30% OTM as it‚Äôs reaching overbought status. How can this fail?  Alternatively, just buy Jan ‚Äò23 calls and puts at the same strike or even same % otm in either direction. Watch which side wins, take gains and investment from the winner and roll into the loser when it‚Äôs beat up.   It literally can‚Äôt go tits up boys|2021-04-30 05:10:11

And, I don't see how a bunch of retards are understanding this negative attention. Autists can see the potential with MVIS regardless of them missing Q1 earning projections by a small amount. This isn't a DD, or at least a good one. But, the world is changing. We all see that. Automation is screaming right around the corner like someone took his crayons before he could finish eating them. MVIS put itself in a place to blow up from that change. Let's blow up with it.  Don't be paper handed bitches. Buy at this price and make tendies.

wfr3vq|n1qned|n1qned|-1|Reading about supply and demand gives you the impression of a democratic stock market where everyone is trading on the good faith belief that companies will do better or worse. There is no mention anywhere that 10-20 investors own 95% of every company, of the dark pools where they conduct trades out of the public eye to pass the price movement consequences onto other stakeholders, of the common practice of manipulating price by placing huge buy or sell orders then cancelling them before they go through.
