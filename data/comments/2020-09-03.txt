Soon we'll start seeing the articles about how the sell off in TSLA represents a massive buying opportunity because of X, Y, Z. You may as well hold your long dated contracts or double down because the cycle will start over shortly.|2020-09-03 10:09:00

3uzxtw|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|35|#What we just saw is funds and MM selling shares to increase liquidity in the market to cover the calls they're writing.  Funds that write calls need to delta hedge by purchasing the underlying shares in the event that these calls are exercised--even if the contract buyers have no plans of exercising their calls.  As more and more people pile in on the options market, delta hedging drives the prices up, which causes more people to throw money at calls in a vicious cycle until a liquidity crunch of available shares happens.  Essentially, we could have a repeat of the March crash if *enough* funds start liquidating shares en masse in order to cover these calls--triggering a price collapse of both the underlying and the call contracts.  Funnily enough, one way to avoid this problem is through stock splits, as it artificially increases the number of available shares for new options buyers to pile in on, but stock splits are only a temporary solution.  Eventually the music is gonna stop, and when it stops, we're probably going to see the collapse of major ETFs and passive investing in general.  But until the music stops, each dip means an increase in liquidity that adds just another few more minutes to the music.  **TL;DR:** stonks only go up   SPY 420 10/16|2020-09-03 10:48:19

3wlvvo|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|16|Just someone answer me this. Where is the money going? As far as I can tell there is nowhere else to park your cash than the tech sector.   Bonds & fixed income are fucked due to zero interest rates.   Crowd favorite municipal bonds are triple fucked because so many cities face bankruptcy due to not receiving federal funding for covid.   REITs are mostly fucked due to garbage rental market and collapsing retail.   Oil & gas & energy is fucked due to oil prices.   Retail and consumer goods are fucked due to covid.   Holding cash? JPOW just announced we’re returning to 5% inflation.   You could buy metals but they’re at ATH too.   Everything is fucked while the megacaps are reporting record profits & growth. So where are people pulling their money to? What’s the idea? Because the way I see it, the only sensible option is a swift QQQ recovery from today’s crash, but mob mentality says it may extend into tomorrow as well.

3vs0nn|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|12|Stockhold Syndrome has been defined as a condition in which traders develop a psychological alliance with overvalued stocks during market bubbles. Emotional bonds may be formed between stocks and holders, during intimate time together, but these are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Stockhold Syndrome has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM, the standard tool for diagnostic of psychiatric illnesses and disorders, mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research. The syndrome is extremely common as demonstrated on r/wallstreetbets, estimating that greater than 50% of TSLA and AAPL traders show evidence of Stockhold Syndrome.|2020-09-03 13:30:47

Elon will be make them the next Enron. Elon is a genius and will create an empire. I can't keep up.   Part of me thinks Tesla is grossly overpriced and overbought, but my gut tells me it's not actually a bubble and we're on the cusp of a great thing led by a dude literally trying to colonize Mars lol|2020-09-03 07:56:57

My account was up 35k and hanging around on Tednesday, despite being all in AAPL calls. I was up 30%. My rules are to be into a third of my position (1/3rd sell at 20%, 2nd third at 30%, let the 3rd third ride to max momentum or sell at 40%) at that point. I thought I was going to buy a house and quit trading, and let it all ride. But for sure, I was DEFINITELY going to sell by Thursday (b/c Thursdays are red).  &#x200B;  Well.

3weul3|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|7|Recap for today:  I made $10k by buying +20 QQQ 293p 9/4 when it was trading at 296 or so. Sold when QQQ hit 288 and recovered a bit. I also sold +50 QQQ 270p 9/4 for 0.22 -- I bought them the day before yesterday for 0.04.  I took a beating though because I was holding a total of about $200k in TSLA and MIK and MSFT (about half of that was in margin).  MIK had great earnings but went down anyways. I plan to hold those shares for a few weeks -- I expect they'll recover nicely.  MSFT will moon when the tiktok deal is announced. still holding.  I dumped my TSLA shares at 412 and will stay out for a bit until things cool down there. I'm still bullish on TSLA given the upcoming s&p announcement so I'll buy back in at a better price.  Overall for the day I'm down $5k. Could have been much worse.  Looking forward:  I think QQQ will underperform SPY for a while as the tech sector rotates into the broader market.  I picked up +10 SPY 350c 9/18 at 3.95 just before the close. Even a moderate recover will print nicely.|2020-09-03 15:39:35

In 1999/2000 a catalyst of the dot com bubble was the retail investors.    So, what are the MMs doing differently this time? Shaking out retail paper hands by dealing them swift losses right now. The IG thots buying Tesla shares late last week / Monday lost a bunch of money.   Couple that with Covid fears it’s a perfect recipe for a shake down.   This isn’t a bubble burst, it’s a correction. We’ll be back to normal soon. There’s no way Orange man would let the market crash this far from the election.|2020-09-03 12:00:39

3ukbl6|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|6|Reposting for those who didn't see.  This is all speculation from Gary Black on Twitter.  Do with this what you will  There’s speculation that S&P will announce [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) inclusion to the S&P 500 this Friday 9/4 as part of the Sept qtrly rebalancing. There is precedent for combining an S&P 500 announcement with a qtrly rebalancing event - the last S&P change on Fri 6/12 was such a combo event.  The problem: This Friday 9/4 starts a 3-day weekend and S&P is not going to want indexers trading in Europe Monday to get a jump on things. My best guess remains S&P announces next Tues 9/8 after COB when S&P adds both [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) and [$ZM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ZM&src=cashtag_click) to the S&P 500.  Of course, S&P could always announce changes to the 500 tomorrow and the rebalance proforma Friday after the close. Either way, S&P [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) announcement seems imminent.|2020-09-03 09:21:12

3vcvri|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|7|Monday, sold a short straddle on ZM.   Tuesday, closed out of that shit for a 6K loss.   If I had held, I'd be about break even right now.  That loss translated into a Federal Margin Call due to the change in value of the underlying, sapping all my buying power despite having closed that position.  Can't trade Wednesday, can't trade today, Fed Call still hasn't settled.  The dip I've been waiting for is here, and I'm locked out.  I'd say puts on me, but I can't even do that until tomorrow.|2020-09-03 12:07:03

3upn9m|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|6|This shit was so orchestrated   Selloff began earlier than it did in SPY for many of the stocks that I watch- not organic buy/sell activity, it's big money actively shorting or selling into earnings plays and other retail favorites  In particular, I was 3/4 on good to great earnings beats, but they all dropped like a rock today at open, before SPY started dropping   Steep selloff at open yesterday too: WORK, PD, MIK, SPWH, DKS, NCLH\*, PTON\*, SWBI, YETI\*, APPS, VSTO, WMT, even NVDA\*, with only the ones asterisked recovering during the day. Again big money hunting retail money   I am now 90% cash. Holding through earnings riskier than ever with big money not buying or actively shorting earnings plays, and if they want a SPY correction now then I'm going to let them have the chance|2020-09-03 09:52:10

These fat cats profited off the FOMO and easily offloaded their shares to retail investors without crashing the stock price. But once they revealed their con, prices are crash, fking over the retail investors they sold their shares to. TSLA is probably going to have to come down some more before they reveal that they started loading up on more shares to start the cycle all over again.|2020-09-03 10:21:23

3ugsax|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|3|So I have returned with my coffee, got a kona dark roast with some half and half with a titch of french vanilla. Also tried something new and got "country fresh meats" which is a little baggie with beef stick chunks as well as little balls of cheese with 14g of protein this is a call for help my girlfriend doesn't love me anymore and i can feel her drift further and further every single day and my only remaining outlets are throwing iron around in the gym and betting my life savings on 11/20 aapl calls which is really good but in all honesty i would rate the beef and cheese pack a 6/10.

3uwpho|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|3|OK, this run is ruined now and we will go down for a while. Dont worry, you have Papa to tell you what is up.  Most stonks are overvalued and need a correction, we all know this. Big tech will correct and drag the index with it because big tech is most of the indexes at these valuations. Elections will bring more uncertainty so stonks will be meh for a while.  Nasdaq will get hurt the most, Dow the least since Apple is weighted differently there.   metals are still overbought and will go down too on panic days, they need a big correction before going up to new highs.  So what is next?  The fear of hyperinflation will weaken since Jpowels speech, that will make USD will go up again for a while and bonds will bottom and go up. Both are technically oversold too on the longer timeframes and it matches well with the change in fundamental view. This is my play for the next weeks.|2020-09-03 10:30:57

3w8oh6|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|3|What a wild freaking ride.  Was up huge on NVDA spreads expiring tomorrow and cussed myself for not selling yesterday.  Sold those for probably a 90% loss.  Ditched TWTR and INTC around lunch for net gains.  Liquidated basically everything else and bought SPY and QQQ puts and immediately regretted it, but was able to sell spreads against them for gains an hour before close or so and rotated everything into SPY calls and VXX puts.    &#x200B;  All I had to do was take profits yesterday instead of being greedy and I'd be up huge today.  Instead I'm down 15% but in a position to make a big move if we bounce through the end of next week.  If we don't then I've outsmarted myself and blown up the account.|2020-09-03 15:04:43

Soooo many people buying OTM options expiring this week or next week then when it turns in the wrong direction by a point or two losing 80% and begging for a 20% jump so they can sell at a 50% loss.

3uj04w|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|8|The dip is getting bought, get in. Seriously, there is nothing to warrant this selling that we're seeing. Economic news continues to be GREAT, always better than feared. As we know from Q2 earnings, that we should not listen to those bearish analysts because they were too bearish in their lowered earnings predictions and now we got companies like ZM with 400% increase in revenue. Don't listen to the "analysts" telling you to sell, they don't know SHIT. Nothing has fundamentally changed since Monday. The selling looks like a rotation out of tech and into reopening stocks and we all know what happens shortly afterwards, these fkers rotate back into tech because you sold off in a panic.

3uqd01|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|7|#What we're seeing right now is funds and MM selling shares to increase liquidity in the market to cover calls right now.  Funds that write calls need to delta hedge by purchasing the underlying shares in the event that these calls are exercised--even if the contract buyers have no plans of exercising their calls.  As more and more people pile in on the options market, delta hedging drives the prices up, which causes more people to throw money at calls in a vicious cycle until a liquidity crunch of available shares happens.  Essentially, we could have a repeat of the March crash if *enough* funds start liquidating shares en masse in order to cover these calls--triggering a price collapse of both the underlying and the call contracts.  Funnily enough, one way to avoid this problem is through stock splits, as it artificially increases the number of available shares for new options buyers to pile in on, but stock splits are only a temporary solution.  Eventually the music is gonna stop, and when it stops, we're probably going to see the collapse of major ETFs and passive investing in general.|2020-09-03 09:56:17

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the autistic through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost tendies. And he will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy our gains.

Didn't know what I was doing then either tbh.  July 2020, I find WSB, find out (find out and then eventually learned) about options. And this is where I am today.   I know a lot more about options and the market than I did before so that's where the real win is. Right? Right?   Still love this fucking place.   My time will come. It will fucking come.

3uwlwe|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|3|Last time I'm reposting this for those who didn't see.  This is all speculation from Gary Black on Twitter. Do with this what you will  There’s speculation that S&P will announce [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) inclusion to the S&P 500 this Friday 9/4 as part of the Sept qtrly rebalancing. There is precedent for combining an S&P 500 announcement with a qtrly rebalancing event - the last S&P change on Fri 6/12 was such a combo event.  The problem: This Friday 9/4 starts a 3-day weekend and S&P is not going to want indexers trading in Europe Monday to get a jump on things. My best guess remains S&P announces next Tues 9/8 after COB when S&P adds both [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) and [$ZM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ZM&src=cashtag_click) to the S&P 500.  Of course, S&P could always announce changes to the 500 tomorrow and the rebalance proforma Friday after the close. Either way, S&P [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) announcement seems imminent.|2020-09-03 10:30:23

I've paid off my first year of scho amd all expenses. Its great right? Then the unemployment boom came and I pumped it all into my trades. Im 18 with nearly $50,000 to my name. What the fuck?  I have roomates, coworkers, family struggling through a pandemic. 180,000 are dead. But I chose the funny stock tickers that only go up and Im out earning all of them. This is the first year of my life Im truly happy, secure. I feel good about myself but I cant keep this guilt built up. I give a few hundred to waitresses, i pay for drugs and alc for my friends, I gave a homeless guy 200 for the fucking hell of it. It can't last forever but this whole trading thing is a fucking game. $200 of my own money to this? I could lose it all today and technically, IVE LOST NOTHING.

3vmj0k|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|1|Take a look at Interest Rates and Gold. They are both down today... There has been no flight to safety in a down day that includes a 5% contraction in a major index comprised of equities with the highest level of participation. The re-balancing/rotation of major funds was the first domino. Once that started, everyone followed suit. Retail investors, like yourselves, that have been heavily speculating via naked options and fractional shares are neither disciplined or savvy enough to deal with this. Buying the dip isn't a strategy that works forever. Inevitably you're going to lose and being a zero sum game the winners are the same people who are writing those options everyone is buying.      They waited as long as they could... They let speculators run Tesla up to absurd P/E ratios.. There is no need for a flight to safety by institutional investors right now because they are gonna capitalize on the volatility in the Tech/Growth trade while have less exposure than they've ever had due to re-balancing. You buy the dip.. Run up the price.. They sell it down while you hold the bag. This will happen over and over until the fuel is spent on this speculative bull run in Tech.

Was filed for EUA in June.  Based on the company presentation today, there was a slide that said they have completed their manufacturing capabilities of the product.  The stock has taken quite a beating lately as everyone is waiting for them to finally do something (and shorts have taken full advantage).  The other relevant imminent development is their EUA filing for COVI trace.  They confirmed today that they're on the last steps of finalizing the submission.  Based on what they said last week, they expected to file EUA on that this week.  Well, that means either today or tomorrow.  Ideally.    Maybe the stock can be green for once.|2020-09-03 13:38:09

3u1h3z|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|-5|Hey all,   Wow, what an evening it was in the SoDak household! After 1 week in the markets I knew I would need a good night of sleep to make good decisions today. Well my sleep was so good I dreamt all night of my Robin’s Hood screen and the lines were green y’all. So first thing this morning I took my $535.19 and put it all on this discounted Tesla position! When I first bought it was $412 a share and I sold at $441.01 per share. Now I’ve placed an order around $416 per share to increase my ownership of this fine company. It feels so good to be back in the game after sitting out for the drop! I’m happy with the price and am willing to hold until it jumps up again! I hope your day is as green as mine!   All the Best,   -Zak from South Dakota  P.s. when the votes go down, my stock goes up. Keep going!|2020-09-03 07:06:53

3tznwz|ilqp2l|ilqp2l|-2|Hi guys. I have a question on how taxes worked on stocks/options.  Day 1: I buy a stock at 125$ and keep it.  Day 2: The stock drops to 50$ and in an effort to save my money I double down on it and buy 2 more stocks. Now I effectively have 3 stocks worth 150$, with total cost at 225$.  Day 3: The stock rises to 75$ and I break even on total returns. I sell all the shares to get myself out of it.  So effectively, I did not gain money. And the day 3 sells count as wash sales, so I cannot claim them in tax loss. So that means I still owe capital gains tax on the later 2 stock earnings: ie. 35% of 2x25$ gain ~= 17$.   Am I understanding this right ?|2020-09-03 06:48:02

Thinking about:  long UVXY (stock, calls)   CLDR Oct 17.50 calls  MRNA PFE calls (trump admin will dump billions into here to try to force re-election miracle).  TSLA AAPL of course. Can't figure out which way but gut says puts.  NVDA puts. SPY puts (already a little in both, October's)  COST, fuck it, 360? P/E 43 for a retail store.  CMG puts. Duh. What are these burritos double as dildos or what? 152.82 P/E for a fucking restaurant? You know that means at the current price it would take you 152 years and 9 months to double your money.... (JPow will be doing that every 10 years via stock inflation alone, so maybe someone can do the maths and tell me what the CMG investment negative rate turns out to be...)  RKT. PTON. What absolute turds these companies are. So.... which direction????   DKNG???? Near as I can tell this is some bullshit place where incels get together now that D&D and FNM be covid-fucked. Probably worth trillions...  GLD, SLV. Calls. DUH  fuck "coins." The "big dog" coin is down $1,000 in a week? Fuck. Off.|2020-09-03 08:02:07
