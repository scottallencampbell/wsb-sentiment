bde160|ecrr3u|ecrr3u|10|Hey boiis. Got too drunk at my holiday party and roasted everyone for being gay. Braced myself for immediate firing. Got called in to my bosses office with the recording of it all to watch with him. In silence. I laughed at a few of my own zingers. He busts out laughing at the end of my 10 minute set saying he didn't know I had it in me. Walked out with a phat phuggin raise and bonus.   You guys taught me the tactful art of the gay. I ❤️ u all.

Tesla, worth more than both companies combined, 240k vehicles sold.  Not to mention the number of jobs, production plants, logistics chains, supplier agreements, engineering knowledge, etc. Holy fuck, Tesla is so.far.behind. as an auto manufacturer.  I know it's not apples to apples, but basically you're valuing a gigantic percentage of Tesla on software and some proprietary batteries. Makes no sense folks. No fucking sense.|2019-12-19 10:34:06

Changing my DIRECT DEPOSITS from a trusted bank or credit union to some strange new companies shady cash management?   IDK. Just seems like a poor idea.   Anyone got their card yet? Does it at least look sexy? I’ve already got a Titanium White Apple Card, so I got a sexy Credit card, but a sexy Debit card is still in the equation.   Sometimes I pull out my Titanium White and hand it to her, but yank it away before the clerk can grab it. I say “Oh, actually on second thought, I get 2% if I use my phone.   They expect me to pull my phone out but instead I just tap my wrist on it with my Apple Watch. I’ve caused old ladies to have heart attacks because they don’t know what’s going on, and I’ve caused pretty girls to drop panties on the spot just by a wrist tap.   And that’s why I’m long AAPL.
