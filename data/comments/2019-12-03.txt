9kpnd1|e5fld1|e5fld1|16|I'm going to give the **Magical Crayons TA** to help people decide what they'll do with their holdings, if it's any help at all.  We've broken through the first support in NQ that I had been outlining in previous posts, illustrated here. [We're currently hugging tight the second support and we've quite precisely fought up to it.](https://imgur.com/x4TR5mx)   In regards to SPY, we hit the target I mentioned yesterday (307.3) this morning and [bounced off really well.](https://imgur.com/ptguRgL) That represents a "completion" of a correction and I told you all why I went into puts in [that same DD yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e55i33/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_03/f9iikni/)  307.3 remains the level to watch, but in regards to whether we'll keep dropping, what I'll say is I decided that I'll hold my puts at least overnight. The bounce we're having now is within expectations, as the former support (309.5) is now resistance until broken.   The price action that will cause me to release the puts is a breach of the bottom of the flag from yesterday (~311) or if volume in the bullish direction begins to gain some steam-- whichever comes first. If we do "retake" the flag, I expect we will push towards a new ATH because it shows extreme bullish sentiment in the market. While selling momentum has slowed somewhat (and that goes for VIX momentum as well), projections indicate there is still a few more % to squeeze. I also note that it's not much further we can drop before there will be a strong reaction back up because too much further and it will cause shift into a neutral/bear-market, which I do not think will occur without confirmation of trade deal falling apart. As I mentioned earlier in the day, [that number in SPY is 304.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5fld1/daily_discussion_thread_december_03_2019/f9jvoek/). If we get close to that level I will exit all my put positions regardless unless the news I mentioned above does occur, which is the largest news-based catalyst I can foresee. Remember, we do have Fed-propping mechanisms still in place (and still available) to prevent too much slippage, so that will be max risk I am willing to handle for my puts.  If consolidation at these levels extends longer than a few days I also suggest exiting puts (i.e. before EOW), but I will keep you informed in the next post what I'm thinking. Either way, be careful out there, hold your tendies close, and wear a fucking condom okay? There's enough autists out there.|2019-12-03 14:35:38

I think part of the issue with the negotiations is trump blindly thinks that he has leverage over a country that has 4x the population, doesn't care about human rights, and doesn't care about elections.

And after two days of declines, they can't take it anymore. So they sell! Note that this Day 3 dumb-money selling can often occur at the end of Day 2 -- i.e., like, um ... right now!

9kdznc|e5fld1|e5fld1|3|ok. now i'm going to write down my strategy when im stuck long calls on a day like today where I expect a 1% drop at open.  1) sell all short expiring calls on indexes. -at open-  They probably won't recover.  2) keep all long expiring calls. do not sell. 3) go short with futures. easier to enter and exit if things go sideways. plus side is calls count as hedge against your short future, giving you crazy amounts of leverage 4) at the inevitable bounce, re-enter short expiring calls, if desired.  this strategy worked well today, would have worked well if I actually executed it yesterday too.|2019-12-03 12:40:56

9jymbb|e5fld1|e5fld1|7|Why is this sub so shocked and confused right now?  * Markets at or near ATH * Markets up > 25% YTD * VIX was below 12 * Global/recession fears exterminated from the market * No China Trade War noise  Trump isn't a fucking idiot. He's not going to do or say anything that's going to hurt the market unless the market is at or near ATHs. Anyone that didn't see this coming is the idiot. This isn't the first time he has done this, and the great part about it is while y'all are panicking, losing your asses, and then blaming Trump for your inability to trade profitably, the market is still up \~23% YTD...|2019-12-03 10:01:02

9jj6w5|e5fld1|e5fld1|6|I know noone is going to believe me but i gotta get this off my chest and by this i mean Jerome Powell. I thought it was weird the first time he asked me for a seat upon my chest but he insisted that it was A necessity since he said he wanted to and i quote " Measure inflation" but I let it slide and gave him a seat because I wanted to be a good citzen, the thing is he is suprisingly lgiht, If it wasnt for my eyes i wouldnt think anyone was sitting on me. The thing is yesterday was the first time I turned him down. I said look Jerome i don't know how inflated whatever u measuring is but i mean i got to get to work (and by work i mean lose cash on options) and he looked a little upset. He texts me don't show up at market tmw, and the rest is history. Should I let him retake his seat, I feel really bad about this since I think i single handedly caused the red yesterday  and probably today as well|2019-12-03 06:35:22

9kkjwt|e5fld1|e5fld1|1|OK so a trade deal is 95% not happening this year. Trump wants to wait until he's reelected to make a deal, and so do the chinese, but both sides are still open to a trade deal. But the chinese have made it clear that they won't make a deal if the tariffs aren't rolled back. So is it safe to assume that Trump is going to delay the next round of tariffs, because otherwise the trade deal is over?|2019-12-03 13:45:54

Look for the bottom to DCA and wait it out. Might take a week or two, might take a few months. Just remember that every single time Trump has tweeted about China and whacked the market, 1) It was when the market was at or near ATHs (gives Trump the cushion he needs to stir up volatility) and 2) It has gone on to reach new ATHs within the next 2-3 months almost every single time.  And if you're trading weekly options contracts, you're an idiot and I hope you learn something from losing money.|2019-12-03 08:24:42
