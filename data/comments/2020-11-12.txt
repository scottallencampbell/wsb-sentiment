c2iege|jssu2g|jssu2g|10|Ok retards. I actually did some research into EV demand and outlook in China.  The key to EV growth and demand in China is not tied to price of a gasoline powered car vs. EV, it has to do with regulations in China.  In China, apparently, there is a lottery system to obtain a license plate for a gasoline powered car. Not only is it expensive to obtain a license plate, even if you want one, it‚Äôs not guaranteed. And even if you somehow win the lottery and get a license plate, and pay the high cost to obtain one, you can only drive a gasoline powered car on certain days (i.e. odd numbered days etc). This restriction is in place to limit congestion in China.  But with EVs, there are no such restrictions right now. Obtaining a license plate is much easier than a gasoline powered car. There is no restriction on driving days. Everything is cheaper, including parking. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the demand for EVs in China. Also the EV penetration rate in China is at 5% right now and it is potentially the biggest EV market in the world.  So LONG TSLA, XPENG, NIO, etc|2020-11-12 12:19:02

c32dqr|jssu2g|jssu2g|7|Here's what's gonna happen tomorrow w Nio. It will fall. It will fall because 11/13 options are expiring, people are selling to lock in gains, and everything is generally volatile right now trading sideways. If you have options into next week, do not sell it tomorrow. It could go as far down as $43-44.   Monday morning you will regret it. People are going to pump that shit up into earnings. IDK if you hold thru earnings call, but at least hold till noon Tuesday.  Let's say you sell now anyway take 80-90% and try to rebuy the dip (for example 45c 11/20) to play earnings run up- you've just bought an option 7DTE that has to sit over the weekend 2 days, and has to get on a rocket to get you where you are now, and not trade sideways or down at all. Hold thru the pain tomorrow, it'll be ok.  quote me: it will be worth $57.39 exactly EOD Tues.  Godspeed|2020-11-12 14:50:00

c240mu|jssu2g|jssu2g|3|So here‚Äôs my market forecast if anyone gives a shit. If DXY can‚Äôt break through and hold above 93-93.5 in the next few days then we might see a massive melt up. Despite there being a dollar shortage around the world, people are bidding down and shorting the dollar in anticipation of future stimulus. Which is bizarre because everything points to the dollar deflating. Not to mention that the banks are tightening their lending, which has historically preceded massive rallies in the dollar. But I digress. So essentially these next few trading days will determine if we melt up to SPY $400 or crash below $300 (and I‚Äôm not exaggerating, we can potentially hit $400 by December). But what is likely to occur is another large crash, larger than the covid March crash, within the next 3-6 months.   I‚Äôm still overall bearish, but if we don‚Äôt get some confirmation from DXY then the equity bubble will do its last big surge before we get a strong correction, which will likely cause a recession for a couple years, and possibly a depression if people keep losing jobs. The 20‚Äôs are just getting started friends.|2020-11-12 10:31:19

China is the largest auto market in the world. EVs only make up 5% of total sales now. The CCP wants to basically get rid of ICE cars by 2030 so they are going to provide all the money and support these companies need to meet the country's aggressive EV goal.|2020-11-12 13:49:40

But know that AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, FB & NFLX have all dropped below half of their IPO price. Believe in data analytics, their ability to reach all corners of the world with their human tracking, and their billionaire CEO who is a PayPal founder and FB first investor.

c3a8m4|jssu2g|jssu2g|-2|Hi guys, I'm a complete newbie and a fucking retard on top of that so I could be very wrong here but I have a question:  My impression is that options (calls) simply expire if you do not claim them by agreed expiration date.  Say for instance I buy two #ABC calls for $100 and they go up to $300. I forget to claim them by agreed date. I simply lost $100, correct?  Expanding on that - if I were to buy five #ZXY calls for $200 and they somehow shit to $-50,000. I (obviously) never claim the money and wait for the contract to expire. Am I now $50,200 in debt or am I still only down $200 as the contract expired?  Thank you so much!|2020-11-12 15:53:44
