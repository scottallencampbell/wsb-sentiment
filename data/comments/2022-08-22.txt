In a normal economy, like what we had decades ago, it was possible for anyone smart enough to make money from nothing. For example, you could get a job using your intelligence as the only credential.   Now, poors are all stuck, and class mobility only exists for the wealth-holding classes in the form of gambling. You can buy stonks, start a business, give out loans, but whatever you do you have to take your own money, stake it on your own opinion, and no matter how smart you are the amount you make will be based on how much you put in and what odds the bookies gave you.|2022-08-22 08:18:14

lbma40|wupfsa|wupfsa|12|Too much euphoria.  All of this stupid meme shit is exactly why the FED will not capitulate early and backtrack on rate hikes. The market has priced in a perfect scenario for a Fed pivot.  Housing costs continue to rise and are a major portion of the CPI. Oil has been going down only because they're releasing oil from the strategic reserves, which is going to stop though in October.  Inflation is going to become much more entrenched and will be much more difficult to dislodge than people think. That means continued Fed hikes for a lot longer than people expect. This shit is going to burn down again.|2022-08-22 09:02:23

lc9csq|wupfsa|wupfsa|12|Look at a chart of 2008, no seriously do it, bulls you too. Since the peak around the new year, the S&P chart is nearly identical to 2008 after their peak. I kid you not, it's almost scary. If we continue to match that trend, SPY 350 will be here by Mid October and then total Armageddon end of year/early next year. I think the macro events are in place for that to happen as well. Insane valuations are at or near historical highs in most categories. CPI will stay hot and cause a sharp rise in fed funds rate (4.5-5% by year end), way more than expected. Corporate earnings this fall will be shit and their guidance for next year will be atrocious. That's when the real selling will begin. You can stay blind if you want bulls, but history has a way of repeating itself|2022-08-22 11:35:20

lcuhmp|wupfsa|wupfsa|9|The only guaranteed way to make money trading stocks:   1. Find a company you love  2. Do DD  3. Watch the stock price move upward in alignment with your DD  4. Watch it skyrocket before you convince yourself that you were right about this stock  5. It continues its meteoric rise, and, finally, you cannot take it any longer because you were right about this stock all along and this is the guaranteed win.  6. Prepare to find the perfect price to buy, maybe a little dip from the upward trend.  7. You're developing FOMO, and the dip is not coming, your gains are being lost every second you fail to go long.  8. Stop being a regard, sell short and buy puts  9. Collect profits as the stock reverses trend and proves that you know nothing about trading.  10. Sip margs on the beach and antagonize bulls on WSB|2022-08-22 13:50:35

For example, a client is unhappy with your progress or work (and looks like you lack knowledge) on the technical skills to do a project. After that, your manager is disappointed and tells you that you are not progressing at all even though you spend hours and hours working on the project to try to find a solution (to no end).   Is this normal and how can I handle this. I hate being looked down upon by my coworkers and it makes me not want to go into work anymore.

lchwwa|wupfsa|wupfsa|2|TSLA is hanging in there pretty well. Since open, it's fallen about the same % as SPY when it's usually a much bigger mover. There's been a surprising pick up in the 700p and 750p expiring 10/21 so maybe smart money knows something we fools, we proud fools, do not.  &#x200B;  I always wonder if Chinese investors with close ties to the government (which is obviously all the successful ones) exert pressure to either suspend or continue operations to help their book. Like if Xi wants TSLA to keep pumping out cars in Shanghai, closing the Toyota factory but keeping TSLA running would be a win. Obviously the converse also holds.|2022-08-22 12:29:50

If we continue to match that trend, SPY 350 will be here by Mid October and then total Armageddon end of year/early next year. I think the macro events are in place for that to happen as well. Insane valuations are at or near historical highs in most categories. CPI will stay hot and cause a sharp rise in fed funds rate (4.5-5% by year end), way more than expected.

In a larger theory I said 2.5 years ago that Momentum Trading was going to become the meta. What we have right now is coordinated volatility with Retail and Professionals. It‚Äôs like Poker. There are no average Joes anymore. There are only sweaty professional and semiprofessionals. Market volatility is here to get higher and higher indefinitely. Blame it on ease of access, the internet, algorithms, but basics still apply to all of the technicals. Expect TSLA like growth to happen in record time and flash crashes to follow right after.
