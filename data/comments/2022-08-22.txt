Fearing he’d be thrown out of power, Xenu gathered billions of his people, froze them to capture their souls (“thetans”), and transported them to Earth (then called Teegeeack) for elimination.

lbg8km|wupfsa|wupfsa|7|I think what makes it a "casino economy" is that in order to make money off being smart, you need money to stake on your intelligence, which is essentially gambling.  In a normal economy, like what we had decades ago, it was possible for anyone smart enough to make money from nothing. For example, you could get a job using your intelligence as the only credential.   Now, poors are all stuck, and class mobility only exists for the wealth-holding classes in the form of gambling. You can buy stonks, start a business, give out loans, but whatever you do you have to take your own money, stake it on your own opinion, and no matter how smart you are the amount you make will be based on how much you put in and what odds the bookies gave you.|2022-08-22 08:18:14

lbma40|wupfsa|wupfsa|12|Too much euphoria.  All of this stupid meme shit is exactly why the FED will not capitulate early and backtrack on rate hikes. The market has priced in a perfect scenario for a Fed pivot.  Housing costs continue to rise and are a major portion of the CPI. Oil has been going down only because they're releasing oil from the strategic reserves, which is going to stop though in October.  Inflation is going to become much more entrenched and will be much more difficult to dislodge than people think. That means continued Fed hikes for a lot longer than people expect. This shit is going to burn down again.|2022-08-22 09:02:23

lc9csq|wupfsa|wupfsa|12|Look at a chart of 2008, no seriously do it, bulls you too. Since the peak around the new year, the S&P chart is nearly identical to 2008 after their peak. I kid you not, it's almost scary. If we continue to match that trend, SPY 350 will be here by Mid October and then total Armageddon end of year/early next year. I think the macro events are in place for that to happen as well. Insane valuations are at or near historical highs in most categories. CPI will stay hot and cause a sharp rise in fed funds rate (4.5-5% by year end), way more than expected. Corporate earnings this fall will be shit and their guidance for next year will be atrocious. That's when the real selling will begin. You can stay blind if you want bulls, but history has a way of repeating itself|2022-08-22 11:35:20

He basically gets loans against the purchase prices to build out homes and is pretty heavily leveraged. Just had breakfast with him and he was getting calls the whole time of buyers pulling out of presold homes that were pending contract. He's got $12,000,000 in property coming online in next few weeks and went from having half of it presold to only having one home presold. Q1 he'd presell 80-90% of the inventory before they were finished.|2022-08-22 11:49:13

lcuhmp|wupfsa|wupfsa|9|The only guaranteed way to make money trading stocks:   1. Find a company you love  2. Do DD  3. Watch the stock price move upward in alignment with your DD  4. Watch it skyrocket before you convince yourself that you were right about this stock  5. It continues its meteoric rise, and, finally, you cannot take it any longer because you were right about this stock all along and this is the guaranteed win.  6. Prepare to find the perfect price to buy, maybe a little dip from the upward trend.  7. You're developing FOMO, and the dip is not coming, your gains are being lost every second you fail to go long.  8. Stop being a regard, sell short and buy puts  9. Collect profits as the stock reverses trend and proves that you know nothing about trading.  10. Sip margs on the beach and antagonize bulls on WSB|2022-08-22 13:50:35

lchwwa|wupfsa|wupfsa|2|TSLA is hanging in there pretty well. Since open, it's fallen about the same % as SPY when it's usually a much bigger mover. There's been a surprising pick up in the 700p and 750p expiring 10/21 so maybe smart money knows something we fools, we proud fools, do not.  &#x200B;  I always wonder if Chinese investors with close ties to the government (which is obviously all the successful ones) exert pressure to either suspend or continue operations to help their book. Like if Xi wants TSLA to keep pumping out cars in Shanghai, closing the Toyota factory but keeping TSLA running would be a win. Obviously the converse also holds.|2022-08-22 12:29:50

lcjndh|wupfsa|wupfsa|2|A lot of talk about Germany electricity rising 25%. What many might not know is that in Europe at the beginning of the year they guesstimate how much electricity you will use and then create a monthly payment. At the end of the year you settle the difference between expected and actual. So most in UK/Germany haven’t paid the higher costs yet but will have to in Dec/Jan.

If we continue to match that trend, SPY 350 will be here by Mid October and then total Armageddon end of year/early next year. I think the macro events are in place for that to happen as well.

But why for the love of god is it down 70% from its year height, which by the way is 50% down from their height two years ago?

There are no average Joes anymore. There are only sweaty professional and semiprofessionals. Market volatility is here to get higher and higher indefinitely. Blame it on ease of access, the internet, algorithms, but basics still apply to all of the technicals. Expect TSLA like growth to happen in record time and flash crashes to follow right after.

I get it, the meme stocks ruined the wsb culture, but hating these meme stocks if their is a short term play or interest there is weird.    AMC is 90 million before, noon, crazy halts, brokers not allowing new call options only selling of existing.  Seems a play here and I know math is hard, but the price is still up with combined ape+AMC than it was yesterday.|2022-08-22 10:56:08

lbev1b|wupfsa|wupfsa|-6|**Continuous Threshold is key.**  A lot of bullshit talk about C+35, if the threshold list breaks at T+10, nothing is going to happen.  Look at GME’21, it was continuous. Everyone else is spreading the rumor. There’s a reason it’s rare, because it’s hard to win C+35 consecutive days.  That said BBBY still has a chance, it’s sub $10 and **STILL** on threshold without breaking. Many ITM calls before $5, and shares at that entry point. As long as BBBY doesn’t do something stupid like announce bankruptcy in the next month, play is a go.|2022-08-22 08:07:24

lcd93t|wupfsa|wupfsa|-6|Regarding BBBY: Threshold is interesting.  It’s one of the few plays where there’s no real advantage in being faster. If you wait an extra day you get more information about whether or not the play will succeed by checking yesterday’s list.  Anyone living the frontlines of a threshold play will be backstabbed, feed erroneous information, and gain unlikely allies every other hour.  Take a back seat, check the list very morning, count the days. And whatever you do don’t open unhedged shorts.|2022-08-22 12:00:07
