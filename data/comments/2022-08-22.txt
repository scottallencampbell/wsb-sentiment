How long will it take Snowflake to make $75B per year even at a 50-100% growth rate?  Decades probably.    By the time they get anywhere close to even $10B revs im sure someone will have come along and duplicated their tech.

h97bcm|qb89rl|qb89rl|6|The core problem is simple: Americans are currently buying a record amount of stuff, and that spending binge is crashing the transport and warehousing network meant to move it all.  When the pandemic began, and Americans found themselves unable to go out, households suddenly shifted their spending to goods from services. With the money they saved skipping restaurant meals, movie trips, and vacations, people spruced up their living rooms with new couches, built out home offices, and bought themselves some exercise equipment. Stimulus checks helped fuel the shopping as many employees who’d kept their jobs splurged on TVs and cars. Economists widely expected that, as the pandemic faded, Americans would revert back to their older spending patterns. But that hasn’t happened yet, thanks in part to the delta wave. By August, inflation-adjusted spending on goods was up 14.5 percent compared with pre-pandemic, while services were still down more than 2 percent. As a result of this buying binge, the United States is now actually importing more physical goods than ever before.|2021-10-19 12:19:34

h8y9x1|qb89rl|qb89rl|2|AXSM taking a breather day, down a whole ten cents after surging nine bucks in five trading days.  Anything under fifty offers amazing potential rewards near term and beyond. Company is eagerly awaiting approval for their crown jewel drug AXS 05. Just yesterday they agreed to terms on additional financing in anticipation of the big rollout of the multi billion dollar blockbuster depression treatment.  Analysts have targets as high as north of $150 for the stock, which also has a second drug under FDA review and a decision date of April 30 next year. And to top all of that, Axsome has two more drugs in advanced clinical trials with applications expected late next year.  Reminder, do NOT buy options on AXSM. The premiums are very high and we don't know when exactly the FDA approval will come in (if ever). But expectations are for literally at any time, any day.  Just buy the stock at $40 and hold. I do not suggest taking any partial profits because imo, that's just throwing money away. Why take a partial at $50 if the stock is a near certainty to hit $100.  Long shares. Good luck.|2021-10-19 11:18:41

Bulls and bears will now argue about whether the SEC thinks shorts covered or not instead of other evidence pointing to them having covered jack shit in Jan (deep OTM puts and deep ITM calls by the truckload, ETF shorting, shady offshore option holders appearing on Bloomberg etc etc).

Your money 100% to 50% = -50% or 1 - .5 = .5  Other person's money 100% to 200% = +100% or 1+1=2  So one person has a loss of .5 and the other has a gain of 1. This leaves a net positive of .5  This is 5th grade math, don't try to apply logic to it, just go with it and have faith that stocks only go up, and your losses are actually a good thing.|2021-10-19 10:09:56
