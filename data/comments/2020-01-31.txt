g46xen|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|9|Looks like Monday came early and Markets are already pricing in a very bad weekend. I wanted to buy some Yang calls at the close today but am now going balls to the walls long LK (got in to June 40s when the underlying was around 30.5 right after the Citron counter Tweet). Based on the futures and ETFs traded in the US, China is expected to open down around -9% to -10%, so if they close anything above that magnitude will be a win and crush Yang. At this point, I think there's more potential for upside surprise (e.g., no news or news not as bad as expected). I also trust in Winnie's 1984 machine to manage the news coming out of China. In any case, I'm hedging myself by browsing CouchSurfing. I saw one with blackleather and they say they'll pay ME if I stay there! What luck.|2020-01-31 13:03:46

Enough Chinese do this and a snowball effect occurs. The Chinese gov bout to cash in some debt and drop a pretty penny on equity pumping to keep an immediate recession from occuring. How much and how effective it is, is what is yet to be priced in. The fears of economic collapse is causing the pull back today.

g3cazc|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|13|Fun fact. Due to the nature of how viruses work, the human body cannot get sick from both the common cold and the flu at the same time.  The coronavirus is more closely related to the common cold than the stomach flu. So if you intentionally contract the flu, you're shitting and vomiting uncontrollably🤢, but 100% safe from the coronavirus in the meantime. 🧐|2020-01-31 07:35:09

g3pve8|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|9|As I've been saying, the best time to get out of the market was yesterday. The second best time is today.

Three factors that could make it tank are lining up all together and its going to hurt.   That pump eod yesterday was my signal to cash out. The WHO classifies Coronavirus as an international health emergency and we rally. Ridiculous euphoria that's about to break hard. Sure I might be wrong, but I'd much rather avoid the massive downside than risk it for tiny upside.

g3sdxa|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|3|I know how most here on WSB HATE technicals, but here's something interesting. On 5m charts and up, SPY has been oversold (RSI) since 9:35.  This is extremely unusual. Even last Friday it over the 30 line and back down throughout the day. Seeing SPY just hover below 30 RSI for 2 hours has me worried. There is a distinct lack of buyers today; even less than last Friday|2020-01-31 10:37:30

However, if I dump them now and go all in on puts, I know we'll find some reason to fucking moon to ATHs during Sunday night futures session.

Chinese stocks should drop when market opens to mirror the prices that these ETFs essentially priced. But why would that make the ETF drop more? It has essentially already baked in the impact of coronavirus. If anything it should be relatively flat - no?|2020-01-31 13:56:14

g3vglc|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|2|Well, I fully recovered my loss from yesterday by not selling my small put position when it was way down. (Bought puts expecting a global emergency.... yeah, sorta right on that thesis, but they dropped 85% lol. Felt like AMRN.)   I would be reasonably likely to make money holding on this afternoon but my trade thesis wasn’t right. I went back to cash gang until I feel I actually understand what’s going on. VXX calls would make sense but it’s too late to hop on that train now.  I suspect we’ll fall further today and then go back to green Monday after the world doesn’t implode. But I don’t have positions because I don’t really know, and there’s a small chance we’ll correct at any time now that tech earnings are largely finished.|2020-01-31 11:08:57

g3hy6t|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|2|I feel like a dumbass. (Robinhood noob)  It’s my first day doing this, I researched (not good enough) last night and ended up buying 1 share of WWE (at the time it was 38.00) and didn’t understand my option to put a cap on how much I buy it for. And it recently went through at $44. No biggie, just a learning mistake.   I ended up buying 8 INO & 8 ADXS as well.   It is exciting watching the numbers go up on my phone. I’m glad I started with a small amount and now I can learn from my mistakes.  Apparently you guys are autistic too?

Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally|2020-01-31 09:10:21
