g46xen|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|9|Looks like Monday came early and Markets are already pricing in a very bad weekend. I wanted to buy some Yang calls at the close today but am now going balls to the walls long LK (got in to June 40s when the underlying was around 30.5 right after the Citron counter Tweet). Based on the futures and ETFs traded in the US, China is expected to open down around -9% to -10%, so if they close anything above that magnitude will be a win and crush Yang. At this point, I think there's more potential for upside surprise (e.g., no news or news not as bad as expected). I also trust in Winnie's 1984 machine to manage the news coming out of China. In any case, I'm hedging myself by browsing CouchSurfing. I saw one with blackleather and they say they'll pay ME if I stay there! What luck.|2020-01-31 13:03:46

g3pve8|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|9|As I've been saying, the best time to get out of the market was yesterday. The second best time is today.

Three factors that could make it tank are lining up all together and its going to hurt.   That pump eod yesterday was my signal to cash out. The WHO classifies Coronavirus as an international health emergency and we rally. Ridiculous euphoria that's about to break hard. Sure I might be wrong, but I'd much rather avoid the massive downside than risk it for tiny upside.

I would be reasonably likely to make money holding on this afternoon but my trade thesis wasn‚Äôt right. I went back to cash gang until I feel I actually understand what‚Äôs going on. VXX calls would make sense but it‚Äôs too late to hop on that train now.  I suspect we‚Äôll fall further today and then go back to green Monday after the world doesn‚Äôt implode. But I don‚Äôt have positions because I don‚Äôt really know, and there‚Äôs a small chance we‚Äôll correct at any time now that tech earnings are largely finished.|2020-01-31 11:08:57

Chinese stocks should drop when market opens to mirror the prices that these ETFs essentially priced. But why would that make the ETF drop more? It has essentially already baked in the impact of coronavirus. If anything it should be relatively flat - no?|2020-01-31 13:56:34

g3hy6t|ewmvzu|ewmvzu|2|I feel like a dumbass. (Robinhood noob)  It‚Äôs my first day doing this, I researched (not good enough) last night and ended up buying 1 share of WWE (at the time it was 38.00) and didn‚Äôt understand my option to put a cap on how much I buy it for. And it recently went through at $44. No biggie, just a learning mistake.   I ended up buying 8 INO & 8 ADXS as well.   It is exciting watching the numbers go up on my phone. I‚Äôm glad I started with a small amount and now I can learn from my mistakes.  Apparently you guys are autistic too? We are also autistic over at r/bodybuilding so I guess we have that in common..|2020-01-31 08:46:09

Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally|2020-01-31 09:10:21
