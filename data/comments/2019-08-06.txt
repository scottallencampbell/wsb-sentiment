w3tdey|cmp6ez|cmp6ez|21|It's more or less like this  Bank of China artificially manipulates currency exchange rates for USD:YUAN so that your $100 USD gets you more Chinese materials than American materials. This forces American businesses to buy China's exports in order to compete for business in the states.  USD goes through China bank, bank of china gives their people inshore YUANS and ensures the currency maintains its inland value.   Normally the bank of china buys American government bonds with the piles of USD they exchange for, hence the narrative china owns our debt. This helps the USD re enter our economy so it's not as bad as it sounds.   If they hoard it, they prevent it from entering our economy, driving cash ^^^ and assets and stonks red.  I think yesterday was a flex of just how much shit they could do if they damn well wanted. I expect to see some more weird flexes out of China.  All in puts?|2019-08-06 07:23:52

w48z62|cmp6ez|cmp6ez|21|Reddit has this "awards" thing where you can create your own subreddit-specific version of Reddit gold. When people use it on /r/wallstreetbets submissions the subreddit gains coins, if you're using the new design you can see our coins balance in the top right (I think).   We can apparently create our own /r/wallstreetbets reddit trophy that bestows reddit gold on the receiver and spend those coins to give them out. I think it might be more fun than just randomly giving them out if it's some kind of daily/weekly contest, perhaps managed by a vote bot.  What do you think, daily voting for a retard of the day award? Random mod-only handouts? Something else? Nothing at all because it's stupid and nobody gives a shit about reddit gold?|2019-08-06 10:32:10

w422y9|cmp6ez|cmp6ez|23|During my great exile I traveled many many moons to places of the unknown. I spread my love for waste Management in multiple other subreddits and was received with open arms as I found trash bois are a strong army. I also ventured into a fake wallstreetbets and here is how that unraveled.   I went into the land of wsb rejects with mods gayer than the mods here (yes, I was shocked too) I tried to post my love for waste management and encouraged others to join me on my train to tendie town. I was met with "oh god no, not another one, leave, etc" as replies. I shot back and would not back down. This is when I upset a mod from that prestigious sub and that mod followed me around to my own sub and banned me for comments I made in there and also commented in my sub laughing and proceeded to go back to his sub laughing. I was not going to accept defeat. I called his ass out and brought light to the situation. That mod promptly deleted his whole user history on the spot. Years of it, gone. He simply won the battle, but I won the war.    All this to say. The mods here may be gay, but they would never pull a bitch move like that.   Special shootout to u/stormwillpass for freeing me. I guess it wasn't known I was banned and it was just a single 🌈 mod that had been on his period last week and was ban happy.

She will give her successor (likely Bergman) 90 days to ramp and then leave for the #2 position at IBM.

w4u9ew|cmp6ez|cmp6ez|7|Bullard was way too hawkish (thinks we might only need 1 more rate cut and he wants to see how this one last week goes through the system), but I don't think markets are that concerned.  Fed changed course because markets priced in a July rate cut.  If markets price in multiple more rate cuts, I don't see how the Fed doesn't deliver on them at this point.  The tail is completely wagging the dog here, so markets can basically just ignore hawkish sentiments from the Fed until the Fed actually proves it won't follow market pricing.|2019-08-06 14:07:18

w4mvai|cmp6ez|cmp6ez|3|Short GOOG.  >.@sundarpichai of Google was in the Oval Office working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China’s military, that they didn’t help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election, & that they are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 Election despite all that has been said to the contrary. It all sounded good until I watched Kevin Cernekee, a Google engineer, say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to “Make sure that Trump losses in 2020.” Lou Dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the American public. @peterschweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Trump. All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!" - @DT|2019-08-06 12:53:06

w4zn4y|cmp6ez|cmp6ez|3|DIS basically at where it closed on Monday.  Been saying for a while that the play on Disney is a post-earnings long-term bet on Disney+.  Still feel the same way after that earnings; nothing surprising about their media business, film studio, or theme parks.  Those businesses don't really change much from quarter to quarter.

w51xlw|cmp6ez|cmp6ez|3|DIS is holding up after that big revenue/profit miss because most of that miss was due to 1) DTC efforts costing much more than expected, 2) integrating Fox and probably trimming large parts of Fox's studio output, and 3) WDW/DL attendance decline which will probably be reversed by holidays.  And most importantly, the overall Disney thesis is focused squarely on Disney+ right now; as long as the rest of the company just chugs along, all that matters is how Disney+ does in 3+ months.|2019-08-06 15:54:57
