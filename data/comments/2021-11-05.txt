jf1yky|qn7rh0|qn7rh0|31|If you're going to yolo you're small account into something, buy a spy call at or just out of the money for at least 30+ dte but preferably over 60 dte. Forget the daily charts- unless the entire economy as a whole is in a decline, the overall trend of SPY will always be an uptrend. Flip over to the 20 day, 180 day, and the 1 year. Get rid of RSI and MACD because they're going to read as overbought and give you false sell signals pretty much constantly.    Then, after doing your due diligence of course, drop your $500 account on the calls I described and strap into your rocket. It won't be massive $50k gains from a $500 investment but you can grow your account by $100-$250 every day or two if you do this consistently and remember not to get greedy. Once you're at $1000, put at least $500 into long term investments, rinse and repeat all steps.    This isn't financial advice and I don't know what I'm talking about. Just a thought I wanted to share.|2021-11-05 09:20:46

jf35x2|qn7rh0|qn7rh0|22|One thing I learned off this sub before I could make any serious cash and maximize my gains/ minimize risk - You DON'T have to re-invest that gain immediately (or add to your account), you AREN'T missing another opportunity and you DO need to take a walk/break after that big gain/loss...  Don't rush anything, the right play will make itself known. Does anyone look down upon someone who made 700%? Not really (not even the guy who made 1,000%)... Speaking of which, look at when the gain posts invested. Figure out the basic logic they had at the time, don't assume anything's foolproof.  ✌️🙏🙏✌️ That's my tip.

jg04fu|qn7rh0|qn7rh0|14|I've invested in the stock market for \~20 years now. Today is the day I made my first options trade, and it's completely thanks to all my fellow autists here. Thank you all for giving me the courage to gamble in a more efficient manner.   If you're curious, I bought PUTs on INVH (invitation homes - the company the BlackRock spun off that holds their portfolio of single family rental homes). The real estate bubble should be ending soon. The home price to income ratio which is normally pretty stable has skyrocketed over the last 2 years and is at 2008 levels. 2006-2008 was the only other time we saw a huge increase and we know how that ended. Inventory is finally starting to open up again post-pandemic and houses are starting to sit on the market. Add to that the foreclosure wave which will hit soon, and the fact that all the new home starts (which finally started to increase during the pandemic) have started hitting the market, and you have the recipe for a bursting bubble. Zillow and opendoor were the first to learn this, but INVH is going to see some major losses if housing prices start to go down.|2021-11-05 13:02:37

jftgnt|qn7rh0|qn7rh0|5|If anyone likes stocks that have a good deal of growth left to get back to pre pandemic levels, that also are paying fat dividends at the same time… Here’s a few I really like.  Basically, while the stocks are growing substantially back to normal levels, they also pay you nice checks in the process to protect you.  PBFX - PBF Logistics pays an 8.83% dividend and has a good 80% to appreciate still with great momentum  PBA - Pembina Pipeline pays a 6.2% dividend while having a 50% runway to get to current price targets of around 48$  RWT - Redwood Trust pays a 6.25% dividend while having about a 50% gap to pre pandemic levels  CIM - Chimera pays a 8.07% dividend while having about 45% to run back to pre pandemic levels  EPR Properties - owns Top Golf and pays a 6% dividend while having a 70% runway to pre pandemic levels.

jerm9d|qn7rh0|qn7rh0|2|I'm hoping to see RIOT over $36 today if corn can break out of this consolidation and get back to $65,000 or above during market hours.  Prepared to see corn drill to sub-$60,000 which would probably mean a $32 close on RIOT.  &#x200B;  Also hoping to see CVNA at around $230 to end the day, which would be about a 22% decline.  There's such a shallow after markets and pre-market that you won't see the big moves until the market opens and liquidity is present.  All ready have $260Ps expiring today.  Might pick up 6DTE at open that are way OTM to hopefully play an IV spike if nothing else.  Prepared to see it trade back above $320 and my puts expire worthless.|2021-11-05 08:02:37

If I had placed an order for one of those puts pre market, would I have had a chance at making the profit? Or would my order not have been filled once the market opened and the options prices were much higher?   Thanks so much for your help!

This includes the Lucid Air Pure, a very well-equipped model available from $77,400 ($69,900 with available federal tax credit), through the Lucid Air Touring, which starts at $95,000 ($87,500 with available federal tax), and the Lucid Air Grand Touring, starting at $139,000 ($131,500 with available federal tax credit).

jg1bxh|qn7rh0|qn7rh0|-1|New to investing this week. Currently have $4k split between 75% Stocks and 25% ETFs. I have a bi weekly auto buy set up for a % of each stock/etf. Currently a large chunk of this is in Tesla and NVidia. I was wondering if it’s a better (safer) option to split my money evenly between everything, and set the auto buy up evenly between them all? I know it would be less spiky gains but idk shit.   Example: $400 in all 10 picks with a $25 auto buy every 2 weeks.   Resources for good information welcome. Thanks!  Edit: I expected nothing less.

jfgyf1|qn7rh0|qn7rh0|-1|What Nvidia guys don't get is Jensen has a certain allotment of fab capacity that cannot be increased beyond a point regardless of what he pays or anyone else pays (due to contractual agreements between TSMC and other chip designers), as a result Nvidia has a limit on its revenue growth that Tesla does not. It also has a limit on pricing, mostly determined by the level of certain funny money coins. So, IOW, you can't expect Nvidia to grow into this market cap like Tesla can into its market cap. That's why I bought NVDA puts, but wouldn't do the same for Tesla|2021-11-05 10:59:32
