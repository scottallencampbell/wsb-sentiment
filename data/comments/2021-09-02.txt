So the OEM is telling suppliers to move over to CLF where they have some pull.  The material is specifically for exhaust pipes, hangers, mufflers, and shields.  I have added 30 shares to bring my total up to 170, I have stacked calls  for Sept/Oct/Nov between $24.50 - $26.  I have routinely bought and sold calls over the past 6 months for a steady profit each time.  Not financial or insider advice.

Follow this link:   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp). Then actually look at a 20 year chart of the S&P (or an ETF such as SPY). I bet most of you blind bulls won't even look at the similarities. Just look for a second and do yourself a favor.

bc1hjs|pgergo|pgergo|2|Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), which is facing intense regulatory scrutiny in its home country, has committed a whopping sum to a Chinese government initiative to share wealth.  What Happened: Alibaba has agreed to contribute 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) over five years to Chinese President Xi Jinping's "common prosperity" vision, according to reports citing state-backed Zhejiang Daily. The news was reportedly confirmed by Alibaba.  Alibaba's funds will be channeled toward subsidies for small- and medium-size enterprises and improving insurance protection for gig economy workers such as couriers and ride-hailing drivers.  Alibaba will also reportedly set up a 20-billion-yuan "common prosperity development fund."  In my opinion fuck that I‚Äôd rather just let Pooh Xi Have his way with my mouth|2021-09-02 11:35:04

bc3dvu|pgergo|pgergo|1|Day 16 of no weed. 2nd day back to back with vivid dream/nightmare  In my dream I randomly met up with the "cool guys" in high-school (I used to hangout with these guys only because my best friend became friends with them). For some reason I decided to join them even tho I randomly met up with them. They decided to enter this secured plaza with security guards everywhere. As they went in I realized this was not good and something bad was going to happen. They started sprinting towards another group of people and I held back. I stayed with the security guards but could still see inside. These guys literally assassinated about 6 guys inside this plaza and I could see bodies hanging. I ran the other way as fast as possible and the security guards went inside to see the commotion. I ran towards a bus and told him "go go go!!" The bus driver ended up running over 1 kid and blood splattered all over the bus window. A day passes by and somehow these guys are still alive. They asked me why I didn't join them and left like a bitch *DREAM OVER* wake up in panic   Guys what the fuck do I do about these dreams/nightmares? I haven't remembered my dreams for years because of weed I think|2021-09-02 11:47:22

Do your own DD, but I like SDC because like GME and AMC, they can't seem to make any money before, during, or after the pandemic.  Plus, like those two, this one has high short interest.  But... from my DD, it looks like 70% of the shares are owned by the CEO and the 2 founders - and they say they don't plan to sell. Sets up nicely for a squeeze IMHO.|2021-09-02 07:45:36
