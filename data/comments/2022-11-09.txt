vputrc|yqfl0t|yqfl0t|7|Lol, MSTR holds $2.38B of debt and their total assets are about $2.16B. Corn is within a hair of the level where they need to put up more BTC to collateralize their loan. For the privilege of being 220 million dollars under water, they have to pay $43 million a year. They clear about 100 million a year from their BI SaaS business. If they try to roll the loan, it will be at above 7% instead of under 2% meaning the debt service is much greater than their revenue and their customer base is shrinking. Meanwhile, the company is being sued for $100m for aiding Saylor's tax evasion.  &#x200B;  Can't possibly go tits up.   &#x200B;  Let that be a reminder kids.

vq5wyh|yqfl0t|yqfl0t|3|My plan is to buy 100 shares of microsoft, sell 1 call option, and take the premium from writing the option.   What's the downside to this? Aside from Microsoft going down and losing money on my initial investment.  Am I missing something?  My ideal outcome would be, someone buys the option and it doesn't print money, I keep the premium and shares and just rinse and repeat.   If it does print money sure I loose out on some profit but I would still make money.   My dad suggested I do 3M instead because they have a higher dividend. And could possibly buy 200 shares and do 2 options.   Would it be better to write this option weekly bi weekly or monthly? Or would the premium be about the same.    Any help would be appreciated|2022-11-09 14:17:40

I am reminded of that quantum physics piece where you can’t know the speed and direction of a particle at the same time because looking at one changes the other. We see something similar here on WSB all the time, how many times have you bought into a position and watched it immediately go the other way, Or heard someone say “I’m in now, sorry everybody it’s going down.” There are stories of people who played the lottery every day and then the one day they forgot to get their ticket the numbers they’ve been playing come up.

vohwya|yqfl0t|yqfl0t|2|SPY on daily/2h in a Descending Broadening wedge  back from 26AUG22, cant do a post but just take a look (A)420, (B) 389, (C) 412, (D) 363, (E) 390. Now normally you need three points to the bottom so one could argue that if this occurs then the next point would be south of 320 by early- mid DEC, However It's interesting that it dropped retested 370's and is now testing the upper limit of the wedge just under 385 where I think it will stay under till CPI the real question is if CPI is somehow bullish than I see a break through and a run to the lower part of that Gap down from September 13th at 402 before EONW. eventually if the Santa rally continues we get to 410 by Mid DEC.   TL;DR : Go back and actually read, but if that fails then break through 386 CPI better 402 by next week, CPI no change or worse then we stumble back down and get to below 350 before EOM|2022-11-09 07:35:06

My heart says we crash down a ways, but my head says theres no predicting this market and its basically just random. I'd like to buy some calls if we hit the 372-370 support today, but that seems unlikely.   I'd like to buy some puts if we hit the 385s, but after multiple rejections off it I'm not sure we will. Basically just going to sit on my ass today. Maybe wait until we flesh out a daily channel and try to do a few 1-10 minute flips. Only problem is, if it moves too fast in the opposite direction I'm going to be bagholding whatever position that is until CPI and then we're back to my original point that its just gambling.   Basically, bull or bear don't come to the market today its gonna be a fucking shitshow and you'll hear 20 different reasons as to why it makes sense whatever happens is happening.|2022-11-09 07:26:23

vpmy2z|yqfl0t|yqfl0t|1|Question for y’all vets. I picked up $14 CARG puts on Monday. This morning at opening this was up like 650ish% and the stock price had fallen to $10 something. I tried to sell immediately, but saw a note that some markets had paused trading of this ticker or some shit, but not RH, (I’m new and have learned I should have opened my account elsewhere.) Anyway, placed a sell order, but like 1 minute later the fucking stock price shot right back up to the $12 range, and my options price had fallen back by like 500+%. My option obviously did not sell at the price I attempted to sell at, so I canceled it. What the fuck happened during the minute or two when that note about trading being paused appeared? God Damnit!
