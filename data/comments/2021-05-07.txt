xb0oqi|n6uyxz|n6uyxz|12|Reposting this from last night as a public service announcement.   AMC on 1/1/2020 (ie pre-covid):   Enterprise value: $10.8 billion Market cap: $700 million Net debt: $10.1 billion NTM EPS: -$0.57 per share  As of 5/6/2021:  Enterprise value: $15.6 billion (!!) Market cap: $4.5 billion (!!) Net debt: $11.1 billion NTM EPS: -$3.42 per share   AMC has more debt right now ($11.1bn) than the value of the entire business *pre-covid* ($10.8bn). So even if covid never happened, the stock would be worthless and even the debt wouldn’t recover everything.   Somehow the business is worth 50% more now AFTER covid. Even with forward EPS down 700%. And even with more movies going direct to streaming and producers cutting the exclusive theatre window? bruh.

x9ri7m|n6uyxz|n6uyxz|10|This is going to sound a bit tin-foil-hat-ish, but I think that the stimulus might be the reason so few people took jobs in April compared to expectations.  A family of 4 under the cutoff line of $75k income would have seen a $5600 check combined with extra ue benefits, probably means the job hunt could be put off for a month...; the checks were the biggest income infusion ever from government, so that may be a part of the story here.  May/June reports will be very important to tell whether that played a big role in what happened.  There is absolutely no way that the economy could/would grow 7-10% with ue gains that slow unless people were actively putting off taking jobs due to the stimulus being so massive that it actually replaced a month or two of income (which it in fact did for families that got it with 1-3 kids).|2021-05-07 08:26:58

We mark 330 as support, and remind NQ/QQQ traders to respect the “vanna”, as implied volatility has such a large impact on puts. If markets do decide to rally today, you may get more upside in QQQ/IWM vs S&P because of that negative gamma position."  "...dealers may have to buy back futures if QQQ rallies.

x9bnhh|n6uyxz|n6uyxz|9|Futures are pointing higher this morning, with small caps leading the way again. Russell 2000 up 0.6%. Nasdaq, S&P, and Dow all up 0.3%. that’s as of 0630.  Today is all about non-farm payrolls, due out at 0830. Almost 1 million new jobs are anticipated, an uptick from last month’s 916k.  Watch for Goldilocks. Don’t want this coming in too hot or concerns about Fed tightening will mount. Too cold and the economy is not rebounding as quickly as it should. Seeing how the Fed is the biggest fear facing markets today, a ‘too cold’ scenario would be preferred.  TBH this report is not as big as a market-moving event as it used to be. Weekly initial jobless claims are more watched these days. Those have been beating estimates, making the ‘too hot’ scenario one to look out for.  All of this follows another record close for the Dow. Tech stocks even rebounded, with the Nasdaq snapping a four-day losing streak. This could be the start of the ‘final parabolic meltup’ that David Hunter has been talking about ([indeed David is predicting](https://twitter.com/davehcontrarian/status/1390335874777468937?s=21) that exact scenario)|2021-05-07 05:43:03

For breakfast: 5 green eggs and 3 slices of ham, for lunch: order culvers burger from door dash (i like to have it delivered because it's harmful to the environment if I drive) with strawberry milkshake (my daily dairy serving) and then for dinner i'll either have a frozen pizza or chicken wings with 6-7 beers, and then a 1/2 pint of haggan das ice (i get raspberry chocolote so that way im getting fruit too). anyways the news from the doctor was NOT good and im REALLY scared  positions: cash gang maybe a spy call once we move lower|2021-05-07 13:30:17

It doesn’t even have to be financial data, could be other data associating said individuals with other nefarious activities.  Speaking of financial data though does $PLTR have a contract with the SEC or FINRA yet?  If I were a bad apple on Wallstreet I would be fucking terrified of $PLTR.  It’s only a matter of time.

What's next? - who knows...  The government should hand out flyers explaining basic economics to absolute morons.  There will be no excessive inflation, the EU and the US are not Turkey, Zimbabwe or Venezuela. They can print as long as they want.Nothing will happen, this is proven by countless empirical studies.

xacf4v|n6uyxz|n6uyxz|4|“The hits keep on coming for Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund. The once-highflying ETF is on pace for its longest string of losses, eight in a row, since a similar skid ended Dec. 24, 2018.  The decline in ARK Innovation (ARKK) is shaping up to be the worst start to a month for the ETF since it was created back in 2014, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  The fund is down by nearly 12% this week and is also setting the stage for its third straight weekly slump as one of the hottest investments on Wall Street unravels at a spectacular rate ahead of Wood's appearance on CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time.”  🤣|2021-05-07 11:01:23

Things start happening when many have similar thesis. and I kinda start to doubt it when I see others having the same thesis, no matter how smart they are.   I guess it comes down to knowing the few things that matters and watch those, and when it starts happening everyone piles in and it still is a good trade. because your in it for the right reasons at the right time.   KISS. its good to be early on but it is just way more convenient to do it at the same time with others. And if your too much ahead of the market your wasting your time as a market timer.   have the ideas on watch list and pile on when it starts to play out. and dont fucking start to doubt when they start playing out.

They are also bringing the camera plane over to Space Port America ready to film the rocket flight.   They then expect to fly a crewed flight soon after May.

xa76yi|n6uyxz|n6uyxz|-2|I hate saying these key words but, necessary.   I’m confused as to why all of the *apes* who love *squeezes*, and targeting *shorts*, haven’t gone after CLNE. It’s at the lowest price it’s been in 3 months, has high short interest, moves easily. Almost at the $4 GME was when this all began. This is actually a good company with good fundamentals, good contracts in place, so a price swing up would be valid and reasonable. But instead, apes target MVIS, the vaccine one that can’t even be mentioned since it’s market cap has fallen so much, AMC....and don’t even get me started on weed, the money black hole.

xa2vsh|n6uyxz|n6uyxz|-3|Not an ape just a dumbass. I dunno if you're even supposed to ask questions as a post. Dipped my toes into stocks when the initial GME wave hit and got in right before RH did their fuckery so I felt like I fucked up. I bought very few shares because I still have no idea what the fuck I'm doing but I had a little money saved up and decided to invest only 1k until I learned more. So I "diversified" and bought into GME, AMC and NOK but have significantly more shares of NOK. I like NOK right now the most but still like them all. With the gains that NOK is making this week, would apes convert all to NOK or keep others? How much did you invest when you guys first started trading?|2021-05-07 09:53:27

xa5hie|n6uyxz|n6uyxz|-7|Hello guys! I sm highly interested in trading but I am little afraid of starting because I don't know si much about financial and how the store works in the real world. My experiences in traiding are in MMOGames where I earned lot of money just knowing how the market works, and selling and buying items and services. (Guild Wars 2 mostly).  My most fear to start is doing bad because lack of knowledge, thats why I want to ask you guys about trustly webpages, people or books that can teach me trading in real world. I don't want to trade when somebody says to me "oh, buy this actions/product because now is going higher so you will earn money". I want to know how and where and when yo check graph's and history and profit and risk to do it myself.  Can you help me? Highly appreciate your help!|2021-05-07 10:12:10

CHEWY (CHWY) seems to be heavily shorted (Short interest of 18% and 13M shares) ... it seems to have a very high market share of pet products sold online (approx 40-50%) in the US market, seems likely to have a good top line growth (approx estimated + 47% 2021, + 25% 2022, + 20% 2023) and estimated Free Cash Flow positive and growth ... Free Cash Flow positive is key cause you can reinvest in your business, increase mkt share by acquisition, pay down debt, ... why such high short interest is beyond my comprehension and analysts avg  Price Target approx +45% (approx 100$) ... something to think about 🚀🚀|2021-05-07 14:40:18
