lyf9dm|frorn1|frorn1|21|As a bear, every time I start to lose hope, I look at [this image from the 2008 financial crisis. ](https://ibb.co/CmyvZtf) After falling to a low of 83.95 from a recent high of ~130 (a 35% drop, much like 338-220), SPY has a ~massive rebound rally~ all the way to 100.41 in 5 days (one of which is slightly red). This is a ~20% rally (much like 220-265). Then begins the steep drop to even lower lows. Looking at the graph, each one of those days is just a candle. For us emotional bears, each day of what will be remembered as a mere candle 10 years down the line is full of mockery by bulls, seeing your life's savings evaporate, and feeling like an idiot. Point being, a day feels a lot longer and a lot more significant if you're not only living it but also participating in one of the most autistic communities to ever grace the internet. Long dated put holders: remember how quickly the sentiment flipped. It can flip back. Short term put holders, I'm sorry.  Edit since I don't want to appear like I think 2008==2020:  I'm not trying to directly compare the two crises, but rather provide perspective on the feeling of five days on a chart vs. living them and participating in this shit show we love to hate. Fake rallies only reveal themselves to be fake after they are over, and we don't have Doc Brown on our side. Why Marty used the delorean for sports betting instead of OTM SPY puts is beyond me.|2020-03-30 15:44:21

WSB is going to lose their minds holding their puts, and then load up on calls, declaring we've reached a bottom in the stock market. The next move will be put in place for the next leg down to 182, where certain actors will steal all your tendies on the way down. Also Monday might be another circuit breaker.  Can still be correct.  Do you want to put faith in his DD?  Idk, I'm still holding puts but I ain't expecting the greatest of returns.|2020-03-30 15:33:19

lx3z9s|frorn1|frorn1|59|I'm gonna be honest here.  Every bull out there should be nervous in this blind optimism.  First of all the VIX is still very elevated.  Second, we've been receiving nothing but bad news and stocks are still going up.  Third, It looks like we might have another housing crisis on our hands and no one is taking it seriously.  You can say priced in all you want, but the fact is people are not pricing it in.  Just because big tech, Amazon, Costco and Walmart is doing well doesn't mean that everything is good.  Oil, airlines, hotels, small businesses, casinos, restaurants are all big parts of the economy and are failing as we speak.  Mortgages are being defaulted and we have a risk of another 2008 level crisis here and people are just breezing along like nothing is wrong.  People are failing to realize that this is not just the coronavirus to worry about.  This is only exposing pre-existing problems and on top of that we have a pandemic on our hands.  This is a financial crisis and a pandemic at the same time!  You think government would really be passing 2 trillion stimulus bills and the FED printing money in overtime and giving unlimited QE if there was no financial crisis?  They are only saying that to not create panic! You think that at a time when everyone is panicking over the coronavirus they would say ‚Äúoh by the way we might be having a repeat of 2008?‚Äù While one can never predict the future, I have serious reservations about this ridiculous recovery we seem to be experiencing at a time when it is still unknown the full extent of how the coronavirus will impact us and understand how our economy is really doing.  When we are receiving record breaking reports that are bad and the market goes up that is not a sign to buy in.  2009 was one thing when the market was down 50% from ATH at the time and had been in a bear market for quite a while. It‚Äôs another thing when we have been in a bear market for about two weeks and all of a sudden we are in a new bull market while data is getting far worse and we still haven‚Äôt really seen the economic consequences? That doesn‚Äôt seem right to me.  How can you price in the unknown and think that everything is just as good as its as pre-virus?  That would be irresponsible and I urge you guys to think carefully before buying calls and thinking that we are having a v-shaped recovery.  TLDR:  SPY 240P 5/15|2020-03-30 08:21:50

Second, once they are rebalanced, they need prices to hold firm through the end of the month so that they STAY balanced.

He had such a knowledge of the retardation side that he could even keep the puts he cared about from expiring. The retard side of options is a pathway to many losses some consider to be unnatural.

This monthly event explains the payday hypothesis; many investors tend to add to their stock portfolios new 401(k) investments, stock dividends, interest and other funds they receive at the end of the month. The influx of new investment funds can raise equity prices as demand for stocks rise.

lxepda|frorn1|frorn1|4|We're in the "buy on bad news" part of the bear market.  This is how it always works; there's a phase in bear markets where markets stabilize after a huge drop and try to bounce pricing in an optimistic scenario for how the next few months will go.  Last Monday was a short-term bottom, we don't know whether it was the actual bottom, that has to be determined by what happens over the next 5-6 weeks.  But I think this bounce should have staying power for the next week at least.  The March unemployment report on Friday isn't going to be that bad since most of the data was collected mid-March which was right when social distancing measures were first being announced (i.e. before millions got laid off).  We might only see something like 50-100k job loss in this Friday's report.  The April unemployment report is going to be horrendous but that won't come out until first week of May, so that's a far time off.|2020-03-30 10:16:40

lxgxv2|frorn1|frorn1|9|I don‚Äôt think barstool has as much overlap with us as people keep claiming  Barstool is a normie as fuck community.

Yes, this is me too, but I‚Äôm heavily autistic and had no right being born in a Chad body.   99% of these type of guys lose their shit after losing $10 on their first trade and never try it again. Sure, you have the odd one who keeps learning and doing and finds a new calling, but for the most part these are people that say the following shit unironically;  ‚ÄúBro you wylin with that stock market shit‚Äù  ‚ÄúMan wtf are you taking about this shit is way too complicated‚Äù  ‚Äú*normiespeak about saturdays being for the boys*‚Äù  You have to have really pervasive autism to trade options. Not only that, but talking about it to anyone other than friends that also do it is a complete waste of time and only sees to ostracize you.   I will say though, that just like with the massive r/all influx, the barstool influx will also get their asses roasted with shitty plays, and be gone before too long, leaving only a small amount of people who decide to embrace their tism and keep trading.|2020-03-30 10:38:02

lyeh17|frorn1|frorn1|6|Fellow autists, please take a step back and think rationally.   The government ‚Äústimulus‚Äù bill isn‚Äôt about growing the economy. It‚Äôs purpose is to delay RIOTS and VIOLENCE!   The scary thing is, it‚Äôs only a very temporary bandaid over a 12 gauge shotgun wound. Once 20% of the population is unemployed, major metro areas absolutely will devolve into anarchy.  A jobless man can‚Äôt afford food, and a hungry man is a dangerous man.

lx00d9|frorn1|frorn1|11|Coronavirus/recession in April is already priced in; only if the severity is orders of magnitude greater than what's expected will the markets move on anything in April.  The March/April unemployment reports are going to be horrendous, we all know this.  May is what investors are looking at, there's a lot of hope that the coronavirus will be past peak in most places by May, and markets will take a forward looking approach.  What's not priced in is basically secondary economic shocks if the length of shutdown extends into May as well as the possibility of a second wave of outbreak in late May/June/July.  I feel like the current bounce off the bottom that started last Tuesday will go until/unless things start looking worse than expected 5+ weeks out, so that's really where you want to be looking.  Markets are also expecting lots of businesses to be able to just get back running, but if dislocation lasts a lot longer than expected, that will arguably keep a lid on equities.  Market prices are sort of in no man's land right now; I'd describe that range as S&P 2400-2700; where it feels like they can just sit while waiting for things to get better or worse.|2020-03-30 07:28:15
lx2339|frorn1|frorn1|11|It seems to me that Powell and Trump are going to continue inflating and propping up this failing economy until it collapses entirely. No longer matters if we end up at 10% or 30% or, Hell, even 99% unemployment when The Fed can just inject more Soma into the market and spoonfeed people "Tiger King" to keep them placated and dull.    May have to close my positions (SPY 0417 200P and 0501 230P) and go to calls.     It's enough to make you want to put a bullet in your head. Not because of any money made or lost, but because America is the most vulgar, base country in the world and it is no longer possible to live with any kind of dignity amidst its foul and corrupt anti-culture.     TL;DR: current positions SPY 0417 200P and 0501 230P, considering closing and transitioning to calls.|2020-03-30 07:57:15

Even the radio morning shows are talking about it now. I‚Äôm beginning to think we had a strain rip through NY sometime in November December. Definitely weaker most likely but literally half my work force was out end of November with some flu illness but doctors could never be certain it was the actual flu and told people they didn‚Äôt know. Hear more and more of this every day. One girl at work was even in hospital on a ventilator due to pneumonia  You can find news sources for back in November December for unknown virus antibodies popping up.

lxzqf8|frorn1|frorn1|5|   Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.|2020-03-30 13:28:03

There are always backtests or historical parallels to back any market stance.  It will only look clear with the benefit of hindsight. This crash has been so swift and severe that it will likely play by its own set of rules.  That means no warning ahead of time before it bottoms and no certainty about the difference between a dead cat bounce and an actual end of the bear market."

lwx7fd|frorn1|frorn1|-6|One way to look at this - they (trumps CEO bros/fed/etc) are manipulating futures because it's more cost effective than manipulating the market while open because lower volume. If the manipulation of the most powerful/wealthy in the world can only move futures up a few %, the market is trying to go down, big time.  Makes me think the last few months of bull run leading into coronavirus collapse were what the same level of manipulation can do in a bull market.  If everyone went hands off tomorrow, spy 215. Idk how this actually helps me make money because what they are doing is working so they won't stop.

Hydroxychloroquine may now be prescribed to treat COVID-19 in France https://twitter.com/MichaelCoudrey/status/1243779158737440768  95 year old woman afflicted with Corona Virus who refused intubation recovered fully after treatment with HCQ and Zpack. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-swiss-survivor-idUSKBN21E2OW  HCQ and Zpack showed success in 80 person trial.
