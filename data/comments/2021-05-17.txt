yffem8|nec4of|nec4of|44|Could be another day of ups and/or downs today, so here are some tips for you apes to stay on top of your game.  Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.  Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.  Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.  Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.  Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.  Good luck out there today, retards.|2021-05-17 05:05:18

yfipp2|nec4of|nec4of|4|Just sitting in my car listening to music in ASDA (UK version of Walmart, kind of) and saw an employee walking around the car park for 1 hour 30 minutes straight rounding up stray carts.   The guy looks like he's lost the will the live, shoe laces are undone, his wooly hat has a hole in it, hi viz jacket is ripped on one side. Poor dude man, sure he has a job and is taking home money each month but fuck I'd legit rather be dead than do a job like that.  What kind of life is that... Reckon he'll be happy when he's 70 and living off the absolute minimum pension ASDA will offer him?|2021-05-17 05:50:10

It's undoubtedly over valued, and a lot of the value comes from Elon, but he's damaging that every time he opens his mouth.  On top of that they hardly made any money when you strip out corn earnings and regulatory credits, and now we have shortages, inflation, rising metals prices, and a weakening dollar, so when you have a product with 70Kg+ of copper alone, plus all the other metals, and metals are rising exponentially...  What is that going to do to the cost of production of each car? They are already over priced, and they'll have to stick the price up to struggling consumers with rising unemployment and less earnings for businesses, and etc.  So less demand and rising prices = what?

yfq90k|nec4of|nec4of|12|Advice Needed: Made a life changing mistake, need tax guidance  Hey guys, throwaway here as I’m too embarrassed to post under my real account.  I needed 100k in order to get enough for a down payment on a house, we’ve been saving up for 4 years but the market outpaced us (Bay Area). I’ve gotten very lucky over the past 18 months and turned 85k to 600k in my IRA trading options.  I decided to take a 60 day rollover loan, this is where you can take money out of your IRA for up to 60 days and if you put it all back within that time period you pay no taxes.  Anyways, my goal was to take the 600k from IRA to Brokerage, try and make a 20% return in 60 days and then return the initial 600k to the IRA. Well, I blew up, I’ve now lost 300k trading, I need help understanding the tax implications at this point. My assumption is that it’s game over and I’ll essentially need the remaining 300k just to pay my tax bill as early withdrawal will be income tax + 10%.  I know I’ve possibly made the biggest financial mistake of my life here, really looking for any advice on the tax situation here, appreciate any help that is provided.|2021-05-17 07:17:02

yg8vlo|nec4of|nec4of|8|I know waiting for a crash is terrible advice but I'm waiting for a crash  I mean the stars fucking align for this one, its not like 2008 where the only people who saw it coming where top highly experienced traders. Rising inflation, money being printed to keep the market alive, market reaching an all time high every other month now, many stocks essentially just being a straight line up from 2019 to present, stocks being vastly overvalued i mean some stocks that don't even make a profit are killing it somehow, market becoming increasingly volatile  Everything feels fake, idk i want to invest but I feel this market is a ticking time bomb. If you asked me in 2008 if you should invest I would have said yes because nobody saw it coming but now? Unfortunately just a matter of time if you thought the covid mini crash was bad wait till you see the next one.   cash gang|2021-05-17 09:51:21

yg1pru|nec4of|nec4of|6|Fun fact: UWMC is going to actually have a short squeeze. After the earnings (which was overall positive) caused a drop the SI or short interest of the free float raised to %21.28 as per Ortex. Also the interest on the borrowed shares is a staggering 93.9% for some borrowed shares its even higher. The stock is also undervalued. After so much bullshit on stocks being shorted and short squeeze I stay away from that talk, but UWMC is actually in a short squeeze legitimately. Helping the WSB community by making it aware to you all. Cheers!  Edit: A big factor for the short squeeze is after Q1 earnings, UWMC announced a 300M buy back from May 11th 2021 to May 11th 2023, all shares bought buy the company are to be retired. Also the public float is only 103M, 5% of the shares of the company. The other 95% are Class D and not publicly traded.  This is no joke happening and I think the shorts are shitting themselves right now, bad move like those who shorted GME 😂|2021-05-17 08:58:32

You idiots are treating AMC like a tech company when they are a revenant of a dying industry that clung onto life by a CEO manipulating you into buying their worthless stock. "*How much of that shitty deal did you sell your clients*" ... comes to mind.  The market cap is already squeezed, but the CEO didn't let you take those profits. They did. And you celebrated it.

GME was a failing business before COVID and when COVID hit, GME should have gone bankrupt - done deal. That being said AMC is not like GME, sure there was a short squeeze sending the share price up but they’re also raising cash by selling stock with a new price target of $16 from B. Riley. There will always be movies and movie theaters and COVID is not forever. I am way more optimistic about AMC than I am about GME.

ygf7ff|nec4of|nec4of|-10|CLF and X are 10 and 15% shorted. Good candidates for short squeeze!    Steel priced back on the move up after a slight breather should be strong for 6 months till supply catches up with demand. China says slowing down production due to environmental concerns then says ramping up production because high price is hurting them. Which is it and does it matter? Talk is cheap I think their trying to manipulation the price with words.  Allen.Root@dowjones.com just put out a good read on Steel!  Key point lifting China tariffs won't have a big impact on price because countries have import taxes that are designed to prevent dumping!|2021-05-17 10:35:57

ygpdyu|nec4of|nec4of|-6|Biotech to look at (BMRN)    DD    Ok so looking at this most recent financial communication from BioMarin.        https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biomarin-bmrn-q1-earnings-beat-135801067.html        By what I read here is that sales for Q1 beat estimates, though they were down because of the pandemic similar to other companies, though down more than average. The company expects to be net positive in revenue this year.        So what is the big deal?????? Well it looks like they will resubmit for approval in EU for gene therapy this year (JUNE), this would still make them the first gene therapy product potentially being approved world wide. That has implications for appearances and confidence which could drive up the stock price no matter how much they are able to charge per dose in Europe. ALSO they are expecting potential approval of another big drug, Vosoritide in Q3 in EU and now Q4 in US. This would be the first drug used for achondroplasia, which is basically BioMarin's bread and butter as authorities have pressure to accelerate approval of drugs that work for children with rare diseases.        Next lets look at the stock price. Take a look at the average stock price over the last 5 years....it has basically been hovering around 75-85 dollars, that price could be expected as the baseline now without the approval of Gene therapy and achondroplasia drugs, so how much would the stock go up with those approved???? Well its max was 131 when they got news from the FDA they needed more data to approve the gene therapy drug so what else do you need to know how the stock will react.        https://www.google.com/search?q=bmrn+stock&rlz=1C1GCEB\_enUS940US940&oq=bmrn+sto&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i433j0l4j0i20i263j0l2.3190j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8        Tell me what you think, it seems like its a company on the cusp of finally getting over the hump financially or at least worth taking a bet on as the stock is in a lull right now.|2021-05-17 11:46:01
