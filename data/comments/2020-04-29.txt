Growth was somewhat worse than expectation at -4.8%, but the primary drag was via horrible personal consumption, which collapsed by 7.6%. That was the worst quarter for household spending since 2Q of 1980 and sets a poor tone for the start of 2Q 2020. Capex was also fairly weak, with the lone bright spots coming from residential investment and net exports. If household spending fell by that much in 1Q when the economy was running as normal for 2 months, it raises the specter of a truly grim 2Q-though of course we all know it‚Äôs going to be awful, it‚Äôs just a question of by how much.

oy1mw1|ga6tlc|ga6tlc|30|There's an interesting idea that comes from the design of robotics and animatronics. It's the idea that as a robot looks more and more like a human, people tend to report an increased fondness for the appearance of the robot. Robot looks more human, real humans approve. But just before a robot is completely indistinguishable from a real human being, it enters a stage where it is hated by people. Where the satisfaction with the robot's appearance plumets below even a highly unrealistic representation. So much so that robot designers often opt for completely inhuman representations to avoid this phenomenon.  This phenomenon is called the uncanny valley.    This is mirrored in the investing of wsb. Where so many of us know nearly enough to make our portfolios look profitable, but end up with extreme losses while normies continue to make 7 percent per year in index funds and banks clean up. Close enough to wall street to be disgusting to the beholder. Not cartoonish enough to buy a Vanguard fund.   I call it the autistic valley.|2020-04-29 07:24:02

oyi7uo|ga6tlc|ga6tlc|17|If Powell had a meeting with the other CB's and agreed that it was time to tap the brakes and stop the mainlining of free credit, how much do you think the market would drop?  The FED is cornered. They had their chance in 2010, but they just couldn't help themselves. Before Powell, in 2015, this poor woman was at the helm.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YAEHJvNscs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YAEHJvNscs)  One headline tied to this incident was that she suffered a mini-stroke while the US economy was on "life support".  In 2013 Ben Bernanke lied to congress when he stated that they had "belts and suspenders" and would be able to unwind the balance sheet soon enough.  [https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2013/02/ben-bernanke-testimony-we-have-belts-suspenders-to-unwind-balance-sheet-money-morning/](https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2013/02/ben-bernanke-testimony-we-have-belts-suspenders-to-unwind-balance-sheet-money-morning/)  He then proceeded to issue warning after warning about doing what he said he could. This was after he lied about subprime not being a problem.   Does anyone really believe that this is temporary? That Powell will be able to wind down?   I doubt it.   So, what will happen when a nation prints trillions of dollars on a regular basis, to prop up their companies and stock market?   Surely, the stock market will rise, but the nation. Well, in my opinion, these are the death spasms of a failing nation. The last hooray before the baton is passed to the next in line.|2020-04-29 10:09:45

Then it falls 20-25% and everyone is convinced we go to major new lows, only for the Fed to turn the money printing up to 1000 and we get a Venezuelan style stock market melt up.  So I‚Äôm thinking up to ~3150-3200, followed by an aggressive move down to 2300-2400, then the Fed starts buying equities directly in huge amounts and it goes to 5000-6000+. Eventually that fails and we get a 90% drop and the long awaited global debt deflation and 10-15 year depression.

oz0o6t|ga6tlc|ga6tlc|21|I've finally come to understand why this market is pumping so hard.   Boomers have insane exposure to equity, with relatively little earnings potential (especially for those retired). If markets were to crash and stay down, there would be far more bankrupt seniors than the US social support net could hold.   Instead of formally expanding the social net (which wouldn't be accepted in a Republican administration), they have chosen to print money prolifically and bolster the price of stocks unabashedly.   This behavior eventually **will lead to inflation**, and keeps the cost of entry relatively high for Millenials/Zoomers (stocks, houses, etc). From an optics standpoint, though, it's a more palatable way to avoid bankrupting seniors. Nevertheless, it's absolutely a form of welfare, but one where the younger generations bail out Boomers, instead of using tax dollars to support them directly.   Even after this realization, I can't bring myself to by calls. If we're over SPY $285 Friday at 350, though, I'm abandoning ship, leaving options, and just going back to DCA into stocks every month.|2020-04-29 12:50:47

I hope fauci actually shares this for what it is. But don't be retarded and actually read the medical data. It's so trash.

We dont have a control group so we have no idea if those numbers are good. They included ‚Äúsevere‚Äù patients who were NOT on a ventilator. No other high quality research specifically published those numbers to my knowledge, but the new york data showed 8% mortality among non ventilated hospitalized patients and 15% among ventilated (10% overall) (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2010419)  Not a whole lot of difference, is it? Best case, 8-11% mortality versus 15% but we know that 15% group is sicker, on ventilation already. Worst case, no effect at all with 8% mortality among non ventilated patients.  Further more, did you notice the trend between groups? The 5 day did marginally better without reaching significance. They did this study to find out if a shorter course worked. Often youll see a ‚Äúdose response curve‚Äù where more treatment is marginally better or similar. Instead we have a hint it‚Äôs worse. So this can be due to a simple statistical variance or from cumulative toxicity by the drug. And it certainly is a point against  efficacy, though it is not evidence of failure.  I‚Äôm not buying these results until they publish the placebo controlled data. Fyi that china data was placebo controlled and showed jack.|2020-04-29 08:35:54

Even though, max employment and no price action achieves the opposite of what we need: **inflation**. You need inflation to get out of a recession. Printing money in a period of low demand does not do that. In fact, it achieves the opposite; and to devastating effect.  Think about that. No price action. They're putting a thumb on everything. This is not health, this is not an economy. This is new age feudalism with a couple extra steps built in to create a better illusion.  **The "V" in v-shaped recovery stands for victim.

oyvy40|ga6tlc|ga6tlc|5|Let's see: in the span of 7 days, I've:  1. Made $5k going short WTI/CLK during the May contract crash 2. Tried to go long but TD cucked me and prevented everyone on the platform from opening any WTI contracts after I made said $5k. 3. Made $2k on Lean Hogs on Monday 4. Lost $2.5 yesterday on Lean Hogs after the WH decided that nationalizing the meat processors was of the utmost urgency for everyone to know during market hours. 5. Assumed everyone would read the actual Gilead study data and realize it's fake news that isn't going to save the entire world, so went short SPY today at $291.4, closed out at 292.8. 6. Gave back all the money I made on WTI, and instead of rage quit - capitulated and threw every fucking dollar into SPXL at 37 and change.  &#x200B;  This market is bogus and makes no sense.  CNBC literally has a parade of F500 CEOs on saying they don't know what's going to happen, and are withdrawing guidance or announcing they made no money or don't plan to in the near future, and the market acts like we've found a universal cure for dying.  Unless you are buying lotto tickets, weeklies or biweekly options are only netting 20-35% if you luck out and don't become an hero. The risk isn't worth it with this slow  bleed up. Thought I could profit in futures, but since oil is locked out, and the market doesn't know how to take turning meat processing plants into Trump Farms, LLC, that's out too.

When it creeps above 100, the market is pricing in fat tails in the distribution, meaning it is expecting larger moves in the downward direction than the Black-Scholes model would imply.  [Exhibit B: Volume on the SPY is trending down.](https://i.imgur.com/UZlp6sm.png)  Low volume would suggest a lot of money is sitting on the sidelines.  [Exhibit C: VIX Futures are going bananas.](https://i.imgur.com/aWhCrYp.png)  Two notable features. The front month futures are actually above the spot price of the VIX *while still being in backwardation.* I can't remember the last time that happened. Next, notice that spike in the Sept-Oct futures? Seems like the market is pricing in a second wave of covid-19 infections in the fall, just like [those epidemiologists are predicting.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/21/coronavirus-secondwave-cdcdirector/)|2020-04-29 13:04:12

If you know when seriously bad economic data is coming out, then you know what days you need to intervene to "prop up" a market (like let's say that there was a certain president who had access to that information, and that president's political futures are tied to the performance of the stock market).|2020-04-29 08:44:29

Total govt spending I'm 2019 was 4.5 trillion  We were gonna do that this year already plus, We just jacked up another ~2.5 - 3 trillion.   By end of year will be double last year.  This proves why GDP can be a misleading indicator.   Including this year govt spending is like counting credit card spending as income.

That was a presser that was released today.  Full data isnt out of course. Normally Id call myself paranoid but the trial design is too weird and this admin is very specifically pumping the market.  Big risk is people will think things are safe and start fucking about again. 2nd wave will be big since we will have a "treatment" and the God Emperor Papa Trump says we are safe.

I am only seeing 10-15% overall gain today despite it being a 60-70% gain for today.  If I had timed call entry yesterday, I'd be realizing 60-70% gains today or perhaps >100% tomorrow.

Bears are talented investors who can find fundamental flaws in a business model or macroeconomic conditions that effect certain industries. They don‚Äôt rely on some blanket retail investor doom & gloom theory.  WSB bears are really sheep. Pushing their doomer narrative week after week in hopes of an economic world collapse to save their $3k in SPY puts.  These WSB Sheep push their doom & gloom narrative between work meetings on Zoom, about documents that were collaborated on and managed on Azure/AWS cloud space, while finishing out the day ordering Uber Eats from their local restaurant on an iPhone and watching The Big Short on repeat with their AirPods.  ‚ùåüêª‚ùå  üêë|2020-04-29 08:28:22

They also are so hung up on the fact that all the bad news out there should be tanking stocks but they keep going up.   You‚Äôre literally fighting the us government retards.

It just seems like TSLA is one of kind in this situation.  I have puts|2020-04-29 08:17:53

I just remembered a story from a while back about President Trump and it could be a solid inside look at what the fuck we all are trying to understand, even you bulls. Not 100% on the story but it went like this. Trump was trying to get investors on a project. The project was not moving but he had someone coming in to take a look see. The decision was made to put people on the site and make it look like it was "a normal site" but do nothing. Literally push dirt to one side and push that shit back 10 min later.... i think you might get my drift. My gut feeling is if President Trump can sell the idea of a somewhat open America, the MM and the "swamp" will try to rug pull him one more time. Just a thinkerino.|2020-04-29 08:19:57

oygh71|ga6tlc|ga6tlc|-2|Does anybody here remember 9/11?  A national disaster, to be sure.   What if, right after 9/11, the Federal Government sent out this response:  **ATTENTION ALL AMERICANS**  You are now all suspected of being TERRORISTS.   In order to prove that you are NOT a terrorist,   please log in to the NINE-ELEVEN.COM government operated website.   There, you must type in:   + Your Social Security Number  + Your Date Of Birth   + Your Home Address  + Your State-issued DRIVER'S LICENSE ID number or PASSPORT number  + Your HOME PHONE NUMBER and your CELL PHONE NUMBER  + Your Adjusted Gross Income from your previous-year tax return   + Your commercial BANK, and BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER, and BANK ROUTING NUMBER.  Then, perhaps, you will have completed all of your "I-am-not-a-terrorist" data entry, and you will be receiving a certificate in the mail proving that you are, in fact, not a terrorist.   === ==== =====    I imagine, there used to be public-interest groups like the ACLU or the EFF that would raise a huge objection, to such a shitty action by the government.   === === ======  yet here we are.  Paper stimulus checks won't go out unless you type ALL THAT into the IRS.GOV website.   This world has gone to hell.|2020-04-29 09:54:50

oyejbv|ga6tlc|ga6tlc|-2|I've got ~$20k I need to park for a year. Intent is to park it in some sort of fund before I can transfer it to a higher yield fund (capped annual purchasing on high yield fund).  My question is, do I park it in a market growth fund or a bond fund. I'm tempted to go with bonds, especially since I don't expect the economy to fully recover this year. But the risk is with the feds printing this much money, inflation concerns may cause interest rate hikes (nowhere to go but up) which would devalue my investment.  On the flip side, a stock account may take a tumble when we inevitably screw up the recovery and shutter again in the fall.  Thoughts? What's the best place to park funds? I can obviously move money in between accounts, but don't think that will save me from rate hikes, etc.  Or do I just go HAM and sink all my money into Amazon and SPY puts?|2020-04-29 09:38:01
