xpxkld|ctvutu|ctvutu|6|Trump has all but phased out phrase "Deep state" from tweets, while majorly increasing overall tweet volume ever since House investigators got ahold of more of his financial info  Overstock CEO gets forced out following "deep state" comments, share price shoots up  Even Wall Street tossing aside the mango now.  Now I'm jw if this will be bullish or bearish long term.  Trust in market (long term v short investors) vs easy returns on big corp tax cuts..  I always figured Trump would aim to tank the market in September so that his boys can buy in just over one year before he either gets 4 more years or retires..|2019-08-22 12:38:17

They’re probably not going to move much. Condors  Intuit is so god damn boring. Who cares. They’re everywhere so they’ll probably be fine no matter what they report.  Pass or condors   Ross. This is a tough one. Been on the rise for a while and buttfucking ATHs.  I like it but any disappointment and this thing is going to get beat up.  Small straddle or puts  This DD was completed by me in less than 15 minutes so you shouldn’t use it as I probably won’t.
