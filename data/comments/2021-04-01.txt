t1xtdc|mhs01v|mhs01v|7|Theta gang continues.  MARKET OVERVIEW: stocks are up and bonds are down this morning. Bad news: today's weekly jobless claim was worse than expected and there are more covid cases. Good news: manufactoring data hit 37 year high.  Bond market: 10y dropped from Tuesday high of 1.765% to 1.681%. Expect bond prices to rise as economy recovers. This drop is short term.  Details:  Initial jobless claim: weekly jobless claim came out at 719,000 new unemployment claims, greater than 680,000 expectation. This should've dropped stock prices but cheaper borrowing rates pushed stocks up.  ISM Manufacturing PMI reports: March report came out at a value of 64.7. Anything over 50 means the manufactoring market is expanding. This is the highest level since 1983. This should have increased interest rates but the spike earlier this week was somewhat due for correction.  Tomorrow: nonfarm payroll expected at 647,000, unemployment rates expected at 6% and average earnings expected 4.5% earnings increase.  This is financial advice and I'm retarded|2021-04-01 12:37:25

t0n0ra|mhs01v|mhs01v|5|Any bribong with opinions on deliveroo? Their ipo crashed to shit, but I'm bullish on the company because:  Dual class shares: Founder shares have 20x voting power. Of course, banks don't like this, but as an individual investor I could enjoy him having control of the company.  Deliveroo editions: "dark kitchens" created by deliveroo and only available through them. Quite good actually.  Deliveroo tailored subscriptions: not all subscription methods are available to everyone. I order a shitload (1-2x / day), so my subscription costs more, but has a lower order amount (10¬£) to qualify for free delivery. Gf orders less, so her subscription is cheaper, but order amount to qualify for free delivery is higher (25¬£). Some people aren't offered subscriptions at all! (Me when I was ordering 2-3 times a day)  Deliveroo pickup: all in one place for ordering pickup. I like this.  A downside for me is the uber lawsuit, riders will actually have to be employees and treated as such.  All in all, I'm fairly bullish on the ROO. No positions yet, but I'm looking into building one when I can buy through my broker|2021-04-01 05:47:36

t1c3wb|mhs01v|mhs01v|3|PUBM is in full short squeeze mode.   I posted this 58 days ago:  "PUBM is the most likely "next big post-IPO short squeeze" like BYND and TLRY. The setup is identical: shorts got in at a low price ($24-28) and used up 30-40% of the available shares to short, and then the lockup on 90% of the float extends to June (so there's few shares available to cover).  This is identical to what happened with BYND and TLRY. The shorts wanted to hold out until the lockup ended, but they panicked and mega squeezes ensued.  PUBM closed at $45-46 today, so it's worth watching because the shorts are so heavily underwater. Most of the shorts are -100% already by my estimation."   Shorts finally used up most of the available shares and PUBM is showing an increasing borrow fee.  Stock can easily double if the squeeze goes vertical.|2021-04-01 09:54:57

t0n40j|mhs01v|mhs01v|9|Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat. That‚Äôs as of 0630.  This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P‚Äôs gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?  Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden‚Äôs speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.  Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.  That‚Äôs all I got. Don‚Äôt fall for any April Fool‚Äôs jokes. You‚Äôve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).|2021-04-01 05:48:41

Soon will be $BIDET  **BEAR Case $TP:**  Easy. Charmin. Bears clearly love it.  But runs out during pandemics, hurricanes, and snow storms.  Doesn‚Äôt clean your butt. Dirty anus.  Wasteful.  **Bull Case $TP:**  Everyone in America thinks it‚Äôs great. Most popular choice in every home. Not going anywhere.  No one case about your üåàüêª $BIDETs.    **Bear Case $BIDET:**  üåàüêª touch butt. Nothing should touch butt. Are you üåàüêª?  I wipe my own butt.

t28b6i|mhs01v|mhs01v|3|A little confused as to why GME is still as high as it is. Nobody with an IQ above the single digits believes the current stock price reflects the company‚Äôs value. Sure, with Cohen on deck there‚Äôs potential for the company to reinvent itself - but that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. So why is it so high?  I think maybe the simplest reason is that lots of people have bought the stock, and plenty of them just don‚Äôt want to sell yet. Which is all fine and good, but based on the low volume, holding appears to be the only thing preventing it from collapsing. If that‚Äôs the case, then - barring any major catalysts - we‚Äôre likely to see a slow & brutal bleedout for a while|2021-04-01 13:57:30

t0uzkp|mhs01v|mhs01v|1|There are multiple reasons that APHA will succeed:  1 - It was successful before on its own and was the first company to achieve EBITDA+ in Canada.  2- Irwin Simon. The CEO is experienced and the leadership team today is different.  3-One of the first to have a foothold in Europe with GMP certification. With Tilray joining in, our foothold grows even larger.  4-APHA is undervalued on a couple metrics including this one: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aphria-stock-shows-every-sign-201307648.html  5-The acquisition of SweetWater Brewing of which was ACCRETIVE deal. Very important.  6-Irwin confirmed in comments to pursue more aggressive acquisitions  7- If it isn‚Äôt obvious by now, it‚Äôs not dependent on the US to be successful. Narcissistic type of mentality typically found in the US. Not surprised here.  8-Tilaphria is going to put up a good fight for the race to $1B in revenue and don‚Äôt think for a second it won‚Äôt stand a chance against Curaleaf.  9-APHA‚Äôs earnings will now include SweetWater Brewing. Remember #5? Yea should be interesting to see how earnings will go.  10-Higer and higher % of institutional holdings and interest from retail and should benefit from the increased volume even further with the name change to Tilray.  11- Think you got the point...

On top of that, its quickly not only becoming a boys world - thats a whole fuckin gender that's gonna be lining up to buy your products in the next decade on top of natural growth of the industry.

It's all part of a rich tapestry of retardation, that while I'm on the sidelines of GME (I didnt drink my own piss either), I still support and live those for whom GME was there entry point.  In a few months, it will be corn futures or WSB will have conscripted a mercenary army, or we'll have a paper trading contest where you only start with money you got selling plasma.
