u8osma|cf66te|cf66te|3|Setting aside the potential for war with Iran for a moment and whatever market effects that would bring... A rate cut of at least 25bps this month seems all but certain. So I've been reading various articles to see what happens to markets once the Fed starts to cut rates. I was curious to see how many months or years we have until a recession, on average, once the cuts start. Well it isn't that simple.     Specifically, Fundstrat put together some data that shows when the Fed cuts rates *during a time of economic expansion (no recession)*, the stock market goes up every single time, with the median gain being +18% 9 months after the first rate cut. Jesus Christ can you imagine SPY at 350?     But separately, the New York Fed predicted a 32.9% chance of a recession occurring in 2020. Historically since 1960, a recession DID occur within 12 months whenever this prediction number went above 30%.     So are we going to have another year of bull market fueled by rate cuts, or are we going to have a recession in 2020, or are we going to have *both*, one after the other?     My thoughts on this: Buy SPY calls but hedge with OTM SPY put LEAPs.

u8ti3d|cf66te|cf66te|-1|New to options question:   I bought some, not terribly OTM. FDs because I thought a higher number was possible. (12c 7/26 - price atm is hovering 11.60 after dropping off a cliff from 12.30)  I stand to make a miniscule amount of money because the options price increased. Do you take the profit this close (bought at 11.35 - 5cents/6cents and it's at 7cents now) ? It's $USO - I'm just wondering in a general sense.  *Edit: fixed a typo|2019-07-19 14:26:06

u8pe8s|cf66te|cf66te|-2|Lol told you guys! The algos guided the mkt up based on skewed technical metrics.  They didn't know that the Fed moon mission was as fake as the real Moon landing.

u7txmy|cf66te|cf66te|-3|Hey I've never traded options before I want to do one with an amount I am comfortable losing. I want to bet like $100 that EA stock will be at 95 at some point between now and mid august. The fields I have to enter are Action, Qty, Expiration, Strike, Call/Put, Order Type, and Time in Force.   Action-??  Qty-??  Expiration-August 16, 2019  Strike-95  Call/Put-call  Order Type-market  Time in Force-day.  Not sure what the correct action or quantity is, and do I have the strike price right for what I described doing?|2019-07-19 08:26:32
