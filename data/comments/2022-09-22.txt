Yes, some failings, because she chooses to be aloof about her failings like we all do--to survive. But also harmless things, like that freckle on the back of her thigh or that she snorts if you make her laugh hard enough or that if you make her breakfast, she'll glow in such a way that the sun will be embarrassed of its paltry light.  Much has been written about love, but I think it is this discovery of things that is all that matters. We were born with pioneer hearts. Our ancestors chose--in spite of all current wisdom--to climb down from the trees. We are born with an appetite for discovery. That's all love is: an exploration.

"Ignore the problem gang" still had control over the world, so the oil industry game was about figuring out how to deal with competition between different oil producers to make the most money you can off your own oil reserves compared to how much money others are making off theirs.  Since then, a lot of "ignore the problem gang" members have died, and many others have joined "don't ignore the problem gang," and control is actually shifting. So now, the oil industry game is about figuring out how much you can limit your oil production and how much you can raise prices. You can't just go to $100 a gallon gas overnight because society would just collapse, and you don't even want to go to $5 a gallon gas overnight because complex business interests are still transitioning away from "ignore the problem" thinking, so it's a tricky game.|2022-09-22 08:25:08pgrnhi|xkx4am|xkx4am|3|NVAX down in premarket at less than their asset value.

Company sells product P, requiring components C. C is sold by some other company.  * Consumer demand for P drops due to reduction in available spending power. * Since demand for P is lower, the company selling P will have reduced (but still profitable) margins. They can decide to lower the price to increase demand, or keep it the same and take the hit. * Depending on what producer of P does, the company that produces C will adjust in the same way (reduced margins, can lower price to increase demand, etc).

BLUF: APE/APEISH be used to signify sentiment of an impending squeeze. Potential or otherwise.   The term "Ape" is associated with a specific company but it doesn't have to be limited to just that. That specific company's notoriety, and the term itself is a result of this group right here. This group coming together to discuss and fight back against corporate manipulation, identify financial opportunities, and create a movement so powerful that the federal government talks about us. Like it or not, we are all Apes. And what do Apes do? They squeeze (branches and such. I know that was a stretch just bear with me).  Therefore I propose the following:   We have a term/title for those who believe a stock will decrease in value- Bears, or Bearish.  We have a term/title for those who belive a stock will increase in value- Bulls, or Bullish.  I propose we begin the use of the term/title "APE" or "APEISH" when the sentiment is an impending squeeze.   Now, sure, a squeeze can and does fall into the Bullish category, but so does natural growth of a stock. This would be referring to a stock specifically on the verge of a squeeze or at the very least showing the baseline indicators of a potential squeeze.   In use example 1: "After my DD I am feeling Apeish about ticker WSB (Wall St Bets) as proven by the following..." In use example 2: "Ticker WSB just entered an Ape Market as proven by the following DD..."  What does everyone think? Smooth brained idea? Catchy? To hard to spell? Share your thoughts and maybe a moderator can put it to a poll. I would've but they're not allowed.   Banding together and using the term regularly could be a step closer to shining more light onto the manipulation that occurs. "Meme stocks" is now a common term and the MSM use it to disparage our efforts or talk down on the tickers discussed here. In theory- if they too began following common use rules and saying the term "APE market" it could potential slow the overt manipulation by keeping it in conversation.   Anyway, that's it, that's my random thought for the group.
