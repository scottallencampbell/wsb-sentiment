x2rkhy|cr4uei|cr4uei|2|President Donald Trump held a conference call Wednesday        with top executives of three major Wall Street        banks as the stock market plunged and the bond market sent a recession        signal, Bloomberg reported Friday.        Trump held the call with JPMorgan        Chase & Co.'s (JPM) Jamie Dimon,        Bank of America Corp.'s (BAC) Brian Moynihan, and Citigroup        Inc.'s (C) Michael Corbat,        the report said. Stocks tumbled Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial        Average falling 800 points, or 3.1%, to log its biggest one-day        percentage drop of the year, while the S&P 500 dropped 2.9%, as the        yield on the 10-year Treasury yield briefly dipped below the        2-year note yield, a phenomenon seen as a potential warning of a future        recession. Stocks rebounded slightly on Thursday and were holding solid        gains in Friday's session, but major indexes remained on track for        weekly declines.|2019-08-16 11:49:06

x2szsh|cr4uei|cr4uei|3|The yield curve inverted this week and the market is down less than 0.25% since monday  OK  the sun is growing geometrically just like the rest of the universe and the USA hasn't landed on the moon since Nixon made a deal with china and went off the gold standard, then the EPA killed nuclear power. Now saudi controlled Citigroup is up 4% today, owns majority of the SPY shares, is facilitating the saudis buying weapons from boeing, and Powell banned all FED speakers from making public comments until the next meeting, and space mining for gold didn't happen yet|2019-08-16 12:00:11

x31sqa|cr4uei|cr4uei|3|Guys.. I think I found a way that we all can make money together. These days, markets move 1-2% very easily either way. So if we divide portfolio by two, buy puts / calls together, winner will make easy 200% money while loser only lose 100% max, lets say 60%. Do you see the number difference here? If we just keep repeat this when market is crazy wild like this, we can all buy Yacht together!|2019-08-16 13:07:15

x36x0b|cr4uei|cr4uei|-1|Omg are you fucking kidding me $TLRY why did I buy this scam this morning.  Depression level 100|2019-08-16 13:43:29
x3bykm|cr4uei|cr4uei|-1|Week 1 finishing, 4 for 4 in plays with 5th still pending but likely to be a loss at this point unless market shits the bed early next week.  \- Intraday OLLI call Tuesday  \- APPL intraday put Wednesday that I got out up 3% on (thought China news gains from day before would vanish on sharply down market but they didn't really)  \- GO 9/20 calls end of Wed that I cashed out early yesterday (though in hindsight should've just cashed out some of them as GO careened upward. Could've made nearly 4x on over a month out call, damn. And 8/16 calls - holy shit, anyone who played those off my DD post and kept them today probably made 10x at least.  \- TPR 8/16 calls end of yesterday that I sweated this morning when pre-market was down 2+% before cashing out 6.8% gain when it was nearly up 3%.  My 5th play was a SPY strangle though, put in on Wed, which I realize now was kind of stupid as it was peak volatility and vol would probably only go down from there (great time for the people who sold me the call/put though!). Already sold the call for a 25% loss, which sucks because I might've gotten back to breakeven with it if I kept it til today, but had mistakenly bought a 8/19 call when I meant an 8/21 call (the put is 8/21). If it had been an 8/21 call I'd have kept it another day and at least gotten out of that leg with a gain and potentially made the whole play positive :/. The put looks laughable now, 277 for 8/21 at $0.17 now, but fuck it, selling it for $17 vs. waiting and seeing if the sky really will fall just doesn't make sense. The time to sell was probably yesterday but I honestly was expecting a day like today to have happened yesterday and so I thought today was going to end up going down with people concerned that there was no real "bounce back" yesterday. Nope, oh well.  I may not play SPY again - individual companies seem so much easier to play on what investors just did and what next investors are about to do. The OLLI and GO plays felt like gimmies - both inexplicably went down, no news or reason for it and in GO's case they had just had an amazing ER, and both are companies I'd happily hold long-term as I think people can't resist paying pennies on the dollar for anything let alone things they'd be buying on a regular basis anyways. I did barely sneak away with gains from what could've been 2 bad plays on APPL and TPR though so who knows.  And fuck, I alllllmost played OSTK calls Wed evening and GE calls last night. I let the general retarded public talk me out of OSTK and you fuckers talk me out of GE. Yea long term GE will be dogshit but they went down over 11% on a fucking rumor with absolutely no basis that's come out, lol.  So, from $1k to currently about $1,300 without any YOLOs in my first week, I'll take it. Tempted to add more money into the account as I have more disposable, but law of averages, law of autists or whatever it's called dictates I'll probably lose 50% next week so we'll see.|2019-08-16 14:19:55
