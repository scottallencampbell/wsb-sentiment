gx1jm5|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|99|Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:  * After POTUS' surprise backlash against the stimulus bill, rightly making fun of the bigly lame $600 check - House Dems moved quickly to try and pass the $2,000 amount they've been trying to secure now that POTUS has made a very public statement on it. McTurtle, now put into a no-win situation has been trying to weasel out of it by political maneuvering. GOP and House GOP is now pointing to foreign spending cut as a means to push back and "secure" the $2,000 amount to Americans. House Dems are moving to another vote on Monday now that today's vote was blocked by House GOP. Meanwhile, as the bill stays stalled on POTUS's desk, the likelihood of a govt shutdown and lapse in UI payments for the 12 million unemployed Americans increases. Good times all around! * China, after making various antitrust statement in the past months has finally made good on their threat as they launch an antitrust probe on BABA. Shares of BABA drilled 9% in HK market and was down as much as 17% in US market during intraday low to $211. It'll be interesting to see if this will have actual material impact for BABA once the dust settles, but given how they blocked Ant's IPO, something is likely to come out of this instead of some unknown internal political posturing. BABA closed down -13.34% to $222. Shares of rival PDD is up big on the news, closing the day out up almost 9% to $152.75, while JD is down slightly -1.10% to $84.49. * In WSB meme stock land, GME closed with red day, pulling back slightly to end the day at -2.04% to close at $20.15. RIP to all those that went all-in on $21c and $22c FDs this week and didn't take gains. MT continues to trade fairly flat as its a long-play, once again, don't buy weeklies you dumb fuck. PLTR also close out red for the day, down -3.28% back to the cursed $27 range to close at $27.75. TSLA was able to close out its first week of S&P trading on a green day, though its down overall for the week. TSLA closed up 2.44% at $661.77 after reversing from a fairly red opening yesterday morning. * The market edged out a green day yet again, with Dow up 0.2%, S&P up 0.4%, and Nasdaq up 0.3%. It's Christmas Eve and the market has closed early, so if you're still hoping to get out of your 0dte FDs then you've done fucked up. Market closes tomorrow on Christmas day and no doubt the 3 day weekend will force WSB to yet again have an existential crisis as they wonder what they've been doing all year long and why haven't they become a TSLA/GME/insert-ticker-that-hasn't-sucked millionaire yet.

gwfdvp|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|5|Okay having thought about this BABA situation a bit more here is where I’ve landed:  I think it’s gonna be a slap on the wrist.  BABA is such a poster child for Chinese tech.   The reason I don’t think they will fuck over BABA  too badly is that it’s going to have very negative consequences for other chineese companies to be able to raise funding from abroad.  If investors are going to always be worried that the Chineese government can fuck over a tech company they are going to be much less willing to buy shares in chineese companies. It will negatively impact valuations.   So think XI will use this more as a warning shot and not full on fuck them over.  However there is still a small chance obviously that Xi doesn’t care about any of that and he just has a personal vendetta.  I’m gonna buy some shares at open and then monitor next few weeks and see which way this is going then buy more if looking like a slap on wrist.   I think there’s a 30-40 percent upside here if it’s just a slap on the wrist and I’m not investing any money I can’t afford to lose.   I definitely would not YOLO and go all in!|2020-12-24 08:31:15

gy3fol|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|5|Lancadia holdings II, holding company owned by Tilman Fertitta is merging with Tillman’s casino Golden Nugget to go public in the iGaming space. Golden Nugget is the only iGaming company that’s already profitable because of physical location and it’s already up n running, it’s the second public iGaming stock and besides draftkings there’s no other public iGaming company to invest in, also their CEO is richer than Mark Cuban and an amazing businessman who owns many companies like Landry’s restaurant group (bubba gump shrimp, mortons, etc) as well as a lot more, he’s always on CNBC everything he touches turns to gold. The merger goes through Tuesday and if you do your research you’ll see that it’s virtually guaranteed to merge, ticker will change soon too. It’s volume and buyers are ATH along with its stock price, up AH, and people are beginning to FOMO. I’m increasing my position Monday while I can. This is going to be big.

Last few plays, the underlying has skyrocketed after I sold with plenty of time (PRPL and RIOT for example), so I realized 30-75% gain instead of 5x+.

What makes you think someone like the CPP who doesn’t give a fuck about violating global human rights laws, has thousands of fraudulent companies using US patents, and promotes mass censorship gives a flying fuck about a company like Alibaba being successful if their CEO forgets what hood he’s in.  What we’re going to see is a literal example being made of Jack Ma. They’re going to ensure that future CEOs of companies like JD or NIO won’t forget who’s really in charge, or so help them God, the CCP will make sure their companies fail and they’ll lose some non-vital organs to boot.

gx7m4x|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|4|For people who want to get into TSLA, but you’re sacred:  Tesla is a good buy ( for long term) no matter how expensive it is now(wait for dip tho). I see so many Tesla in Hong Kong today. I always knew Tesla is quite popular here(not a household name, but often mentioned in local forums) but I did not expect Tesla to be EVERYWHERE. Considering the fact that Tesla is not cheap, and there are so many cheaper options, seeing that many Tesla is mind-blowing. Can’t say for sure but buying Tesla dip never do you wrong. It reminds me of Apple (iPhone4 era).  But if the market crashes, your money 💸💸💸.🤡|2020-12-24 13:05:55

This is for autism purposes only. Invest at your own risk.

Sinovac has asked Brazil not to disclose the full results of trials of the so-called Coronavac for 15 days, according to the Instituto Butantan, which is overseeing the trials.  The Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo earlier reported the Coronavac had shown an efficacy greater than 50% in stage-three trials.”  [source](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Coronavirus-Free-to-read/Coronavirus-latest-China-and-Indonesia-ban-travel-from-UK)   "I'm worried that perhaps the efficacy rate is not so high after all," Dias said.

A lot of people will just click the first thing rather than scrolling down to the unpaid search result they asked for. Obviously sometimes a competitor shows up as the ad, which would be the intended goal. Wonder if companies will catch on that a lot of their ad spend is bs|2020-12-24 12:48:19

gxiv9i|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|3|🚨 BIG DD MOVE, DON’T READ IF YOU HATE MONEY‼️  When you get your stimmy package, use some of the proceeds to fly to the capital of Pakistan. Tell the president you’re a 🏳️‍🌈🐻, by the time you get there you’ll be the only one left. He will then hand you millions of the LGBTQ fund from the US. You will then fly back to the states and yolo it all into BABA calls. During this time, every news station in the country is going to want to hear about your brave journey. Go on Ellen and tell them how big of a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 you are. You will have millions of fans in which you can use to help fund your charitable cause (for yourself) for even more tendies!|2020-12-24 14:57:30

The bureaucrats take that as, $2000,+$600, +the wasteful spending. Insanity. They’ve been pulling shit like that since Nixon was president, and Milton Friedman proposed the negative income tax... TO REPLACE welfare. What ends up happening, congress votes to add a negative income tax to all the existing welfare, and the support fell apart. Guess what’s going to happen with this stimulus?

gwx20q|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|3|GME is slowly dipping fellas. It means two things. Short holders are desperately trying to drive the price down, which means if it dips below 19 get back in with every spare dollar you can afford to lose. GME is gonna jump back up next week at some point. Again, shares, not options. No weeklies retards! If you’ve been selling at the top and buying at the bottom consistently with GME you’ve already been printing money. Get in now because we’re either getting a MOASS or just the stock returning to its actual value, which is way higher than any of the mainstream cucks give it credit for.

Be grateful for the people in your life who are there for you, and fade those that aren’t. Keep working towards whatever it is you’re doing and when the day comes when you shred “earnings estimates” watch as all of a sudden everyone wants to be associated with you and your stock price goes to the moon. Your intrinsic value is hung like Hulk. Keep at it. Merry Christmas|2020-12-24 10:32:35

I've been throwing this one on a lot lately: [Sisters of Mercy - Dominion / Mother Russia](https://youtu.be/0NqBJQksIIo)  I like it because it was written at the tail of the cold war by some British goth intellectual and it shouts out Ozymandias and then compares Lloyd's of London to blind men and mine workers and accuses Reagan of being a Russian puppet and it ends on a posadist prayer for Russia to nuke America but if you play it in reverse it says "have mercy" a bunch of times so that there's some voodoo shit going on where every time you play it you might think you're praying for nuclear dominion but actually you're being cancelled out by a prayer for world peace. Pretty nifty shit. I feel like it gets the devil to stay out of my way and I can just vibe with Putin the richest man alive and f e e l the market when this song is playing.

gwgsoo|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|1|Can anyone here actually explain the mechanism for how quantitative easing makes it into the markets?   All the FED is doing is buying treasuries from banks and shoring up their reserves. Their balance sheet goes up, but no money was created, it’s just a 1 for 1 swap. To create money the banks actually have to want to lend out, and even though their reserves are healthy due to QE credit is contracting and they don’t want to lend.   Can anyone explain how Japan has done this to a greater extent and still failed to create inflation, yet somehow we expect it?   Paging anyone with more than 3 braincells.|2020-12-24 08:47:04

gweu0a|kjdkdk|kjdkdk|-14|To the 0.3 people in this subreddit smart enough to understand this, here's my outlook 5 minutes before the market opens for today:  The heat map of the global power struggle between authoritarians and libertarians is acting a lot like the heat map of climatic temperature offsets. Hot and cool zones moving around the earth sporadically and unpredictably. Right now the west is relatively cool but the east is fluctuating wildly around varying but all above-normal levels of heat like it has been for over a year now and a lot of things that have been bending the whole time are at their breaking point. Since they're on the faux-communism control scheme in most of that hemisphere, the power struggle being in a heat wave in that hemisphere overall means faux-communism is lashing out at capitalism globally right now while the faux-capitalists in the west can afford to take the hit without too much liberty bubbling up in their spheres. Putin will continue ordering Xi to attack capitalists and consolidate the CCCP's power as long as he's dealing with Navalny, and as long as the US is paralyzed by this game of chicken we keep playing with our impending civil war, he doesn't really need to give our injuries much focus. The UK with their border/supply chain crisis is honestly worth more of Putin's attention than the US right now. So the USD is going to keep sliding to make the market look good relative to it, our market will basically keep looking like a circus with random shit happening and news going haywire all the time to keep the cycle of chaos in a stable balanced back-and-forth loop between the bulls and the bears, and most of the interesting action where real shit is happening based on real factors is going to be from the east. So if you like doing actual analysis-based trading for big gains and you're not just here for the casino of gambling on random ups and downs of the circus, pay attention to what's happening with BABA and try playing your money in a country with anything going on other than America's chaos-on-autopilot situation. Trust me, there are enough foreign companies on Robinhood these days, you don't have to sled downhill with USD all winter or hope to get lucky with something like GME by pure random chance.  *In the meeting of mined; down in the streets of shame; in the betting of Names on gold to rust; in the land of the blind, be King*|2020-12-24 08:24:54

Georgia run-offs occur. If Dems win, run for the hills. We’re fucked. Dollar to die, market to die, everything to die.  3. Stimulus arguing AGAIN lmfao. Can see this not getting signed until Biden is in office.  4. A lot of people about to get kicked out of their houses / apartments bc eviction’s can begin occurring again.  5. We are just overall at generally overbought levels. Just look at the Russell 2000. Most managers anticipating 5-10% pullback.   Personally, IWM $185 for end of January looking extremely juicy.|2020-12-24 14:27:36
