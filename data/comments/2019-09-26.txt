1i194j|d9i3d1|d9i3d1|3|So nobody's gonna talk about core PCE ?   It almost hit the 2% target for Q2 with 1.9 (1.7 estimates, 1.1 Q1), this looks much worse for further rate cuts yet the FOMC bets are still 55/45 cut/no cut for october and didn't budge at all.  Reminder of Fed's business : target 2% inflation (preferred measure core PCE, Q2 at 1.9) and low unemployment  In terms of jobs it's not changed much but the core PCE for Q2 is really getting closer with their target.  Gold remains basically unchanged after these releases and S&P is down 7 points (bout -.25%)|2019-09-26 08:25:07

1ijssm|d9i3d1|d9i3d1|2|question for you guys, since I've been screwing this up multiple times and blowing my account, plus I have a day trade call now, which I've never had before (not the same as PDT)  Say I have for example, 100 QQQ 189.5Ps which I'm up 100% on. I want to minimize the risk and keep some of the profit, but I don't want to close it and open a new position, because that would eat up my margin (which I currently don't have the benefit of time and tick). Would you roll all contracts down to say QQQ 188Ps for a credit? Or should I just sell off say, 50?|2019-09-26 10:22:25

SPY still could go relatively sideways with slight bleeding until trade news bring us into a new short-term range. I‚Äôd bet on trade downside, so place bets tomorrow on any morning bumps before things get even weirder next week, but ease in because de-escalation signaling could come from both ends before things fall apart mid-late October. Or not, so don‚Äôt fucking over-leverage.  Edit: where the fuck are these downvotes coming from? Is it because I‚Äôm still bullish short-term? Still bearish for mid-late October, but is it because ya‚Äôll entered puts too early because you thought impeachment developments would bring us lower?
