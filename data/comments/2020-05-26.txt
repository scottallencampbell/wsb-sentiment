As long as the contracts aren’t too expensive when you buy (play dips and peaks on moving averages), just go a dollar or two out of the money and profit. Made 320% on my coke 5/29 46c, which I bought at $44.90 and the IV was 22%.

I want to believe there is at least one of you out there.  Lets say that lucky duck made 40x from puts and on top of that, another 40x from calls, sold somewhere in the world, today, at a cool 160 000% profit. Even if it was some $100 bucks, that lucky duck still got away with cool $160k and just now is probably heading out to get some sweet tendies. I want to believe.|2020-05-26 10:47:11

Meanwhile, we're facing a **deflationary** crisis with consumer spending habits having clearly changed. Trump Bucks, CARES, and the various other measures are due to run out over the coming 2 months, meaning that discretionary spending on tech gadgets and consumer goods from AMZN are going to take a hit.  This honestly seems like the best time for long dated QQQ puts that we've ever seen. The bubble has reinflated itself despite being stabbed full of holes by a thousand COVID swords. Eventually (before 2021), the inevitable will come to pass.   I'll be putting $75k into June 2021 QQQ $210p's at open. I intend to sell monthly calendar spreads against these.|2020-05-26 07:42:53

rwatpb|gqubyt|gqubyt|3|The NASDAQ is trading within 2% of its ATH 3 months into a pandemic with 20% of the country unemployed and with double digit unemployment expected to continue for the rest of the year.  Trump Bucks are mostly already spent, and the unemployment relief from the CARES act expires in about 2 months. The bill to extend this relief is tied up in senate, with a number of major obstacles to overcome.  Although The Fed's recent actions will likely result in inflation eventually, right now the economy is most facing deflationary pressures. We recently saw the worst GDP numbers on record, and the lowest production numbers in history across multiple sectors.  Meanwhile, the spectre of a second wave lurks in the wings.

rw2ggg|gqubyt|gqubyt|1|It is time for SPY300 truce between BEARS and BULLS.  During WWI, Christmas truce began when German troops began to light candles and sing Christmas Carols. Soon British troops across the lines began to join in or sing their own carols. Brave soldiers began to make their way into the area between the two lines called "No Man's Land." They met up with enemy soldiers to exchange gifts and souvenirs.  Some of the generals and leaders didn't want the soldiers to engage in the unofficial truce. Orders came down from the commanders on both sides that the soldiers should not "fraternize" or communicate with the enemy. The generals were afraid that this would cause the soldiers to be less aggressive in future engagements.

You’re losing your money betting on the easier way to lose all your investment money when instead you can have safer, more reliable gains investing in companies that are PROVEN to have the ‘get rich quick’ returns you’ve been searching for.   What are the plays you ask? I have no idea, wish I knew, I’m down like $4k but I bought a whole bunch of shungite! Rocks. Do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, not Suge Knight. I think he’s locked up in prison. Talking shungite! Anyways, it’s a 2 billion year old.. like rock, stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air.

rvy2a1|gqubyt|gqubyt|0|I have a new strategy after going 750->13.5k in 3 weeks and then 13.5k->6100 in 2 days.   I pulled out 1k on Friday, was all in with the other 5100. Had some SPY FDs that really paid off, opened the day at $8100 and instantly sold my FDs at opening bell, basically securing about $2500 in profit. Then sold a few other contracts to take a little profit, but still holding roughly 5k in options. Withdrew $1k, have 1900 in cash.   Gonna only play with 5k and if I make gains above it, pull them out RIGHT AWAY. Still yoloing to some extent, but FUCK being up then down $7500 in the course of a week fucked me up. I had plans for that money, I can do so fucking much with $7500.  Even now, taking $2900 in profits feels like a loss because I WAS up so fucking high, but the reality is I made $2900 in about 5 minutes today and I'm not risking that fucking money, it is mine and I can use it for actually things besides gambling on overhyped WSB shill lottery tickets and bad earnings plays.|2020-05-26 11:56:36

rx3w29|gqubyt|gqubyt|-2|As a newb 3months in - It’s hard to find a strategy and stick to it. It’s like every time I get greedy and think this is the time it’s not going to bounce or dip and hold my position to long when a major part of me knows I should sell and reposition. Have to learn to take my 10-20% and get the fuck out then pick a suitable position to jump back in.   Any of you dudes consistently win? If so what strategies work best for you?   My positions now are:  $bynd puts 133$ 5/29 117$ 5/29 135 6/19  129 6/19 115 6/19  I jumped in to early on this one and am down 30% since jumping all in on this position. I’m betting on another 2 down days tomorrow and Wednesday down to the 125-120 range, then sell  to reposition for the possible bounce back up to the 130 range... I could maximize my gains if I could ride the wave down properly. So fn hard.   I feel I’m starting to get a feel for this stocks movements. But I find it hard to execute in a manner that locks in my profits at 10%-20% it seems to be such a disciplined action to execute in such a way. Is setting sell prices on my options each day a good strategy? I hear lots of guys talking about setting stop losses and I’m assuming this is what they are talking about. Does anyone use the opposite strategy to lock in gains when you feel the stock is confidently moving in a given direction?|2020-05-26 17:36:13
