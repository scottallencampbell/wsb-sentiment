Many analysts focused on aspects of individual businesses that had nothing to do with how they generated revenue or their cash flow.  2.	Significantly Overvalued Stocks. In addition to focusing on unnecessary metrics, analysts used very high multipliers in their models and formulas for valuing Internet companies, which resulted in unrealistic and overly optimistic values. Although more conservative analysts disagreed, their recommendations were virtually drowned out by the overwhelming hype in the financial community around Internet stocks.   🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶|2020-07-02 11:36:56

wpu54b|hjudrj|hjudrj|9|A economist and his friend are walking down the street discussing the recent coronavirus increases in the US. The friend is sure that this will cause the market to crash soon because of the likely increase in lockdowns.  The economist laughs and shakes his head, "That was priced in ages ago!" he says dismissively. The friend nods in agreement.  The friend stops and says, "Look, there is a $20 bill on the ground!"  The economist turns and coolly replies, "Can't be. If there was a $20 bill on the ground, somebody would have already picked it up."|2020-07-02 12:21:46

The company produced more than 82,000 vehicles in the quarter despite the temporary shutdown of its main factory in Fremont, Calif. due to the coronavirus, Tesla said. Production has now returned to previous levels, the company added.  The quarterly production figures included 75,946 Model 3 or Model Y vehicles and 6,326 Model S or Model X vehicles, Tesla said. Overall, 5% of the company's deliveries in the quarter are subject to lease accounting.  Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com|2020-07-02 07:11:47

wowkqe|hjudrj|hjudrj|3|Hey, little brothers.  Just a note: if you have been doing well lately and are starting to get into buying or selling option spreads but are still using Robinhood, I highly recommend opening an account with a different broker and doing it there.  Tastyworks is my personal favorite and has the best reliability during volatile times when other brokers are having outages, in my experience.  Their interfaces are much better designed for spreads and the fees are meaningless compared to the better fills you will get and better user interface to manage orders.|2020-07-02 08:02:44

Over 1.8 million schoolchildren took part in the trial.[6] News was made public of the vaccine's success on April 12, 1955, and Salk was hailed as a "miracle worker" and the day almost became a national holiday.[citation needed]   This was what was required to prove out a fairly simple vaccine.

wq8ahh|hjudrj|hjudrj|3|Got an alert from the aurora report this morning. Here is how they see it.  Pluses 1. No longer in bankruptcy 2. There is a state sponsored large fund to compensate future victims of wild fires, so it’s not all on PCG for future wildfires 3. The company has insurance now for future shit like this 4. Number of hot tech companies are getting their electricity from PCG 5. PCG is expected to earn about $1/share and since the stock is trading at 9.50, this gives a PE of about 9. Compare this to all these other stocks trading at PE greater than 30+ 6. Corona or not/ lockdown or not, we are all gonna need electricity. It’s a recession/ depression proof play  Cons 1. They will still need to spend money doing upgrades of its current infrastructure  2. What if we get another apocalyptic wildfire that the funds setup by the state won’t be able to cover liabilities? I mean it can happen, but they’ve learned a pretty expensive lesson to fix some shit   Some targets: 22 to 24 dollars in 1-2 yr time. We will see how the Robinhooders behave when they discover this thing.  Disclosure: Just bought Jan 2022 call options. Premiums are not as jacked up. Yet!!|2020-07-02 14:12:58

wpp1sa|hjudrj|hjudrj|8|NKLA deserves the PP shape chart. No prototype, just renders with Photoshop.  If this piece of $#!T company doesn't smell like a scam, look no further at [CEO Trevor Milton](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor)'s and [Nikola Motor](https://twitter.com/nikolamotor)'s unverified Twitter accounts.  Just another Tesla copycat with a non-sense hydrogen fuel cell product. Why would anyone go with hydrogen fuel cell if Tesla is already developing +100 kW, tri-motor powertrains expected to surpass 400 miles range. Battery development and supercharging technology + availability of electric charging stations instantly makes Nikola's alternative to fully electric vehicles to be an incoherent plan. I just see redundancy in Nikola offering both options (hydrogen fuel cell and all-electric vehickes) and the CEO is all bark and no bite.  Trevor Milton needs to stop tweeting in an attempt to pump (i.e. exaggerate) NKLA's value and just execute the plan to build the vehicles. Oh wait, Trevor Milton is not an engineer like Elon Musk, just another serial entrepeneur.  # TL;DR: NKLA $10 P 10/16.|2020-07-02 11:41:20

wpsi2b|hjudrj|hjudrj|12|   I've been reading these "Corona is cancelled" and "no one cares about the virus anymore" posts for weeks. Listen retards, I know "priced in" is a meme, but this is a PSA for anyone who actually believes that anything is priced in - it rarely is. The market was fucking MOONING all through the first 2 MONTHS of grim pandemic news at the beginning of the year. It wasn't until the last possible second that the market reacted to it and the crash was monstrous.  2021 isn't priced in. Future profits aren't priced in. Second wave isn't priced in. Trump winning or losing the election isn't priced in. ZM is at P/E 2500+ and Hertz flew up hundreds of percent after catastrophic bankruptcy news. If you trade based on "priced in," prepare to get fucked. If you think the market won't eventually care about catastrophic Covid numbers, you're going to get fucked. If you trade like the market has to care about those numbers right now, you're going to get fucked. If you want to make money, just think like you're a short-sighted retard and don't be the last guy holding the bag|2020-07-02 12:08:44

wpkfzt|hjudrj|hjudrj|6|we need more video games that capture the feeling that only gets given when you played WoW for the first time, back in the early '00s, and realized how far out you could zoom the map  A single player game that large, even if basically all the quest lines were the same disjointed poorly fragmented mess, is what we need  not big for bigs sake, well sure, that too, but what i was thinking was, artificial doesnt mean it isnt real. There really is a reason those trees are there, and for your character, they are 'real', they simply have been placed with purpose. They are artificial, but still real.  Those sorts of articial worlds are what gain value with size. It isnt back country roads with nothing on them in San Andreas, its nestled villages hidden away, waiting for you to come find them  Nothing in my life has ever felt the same, or greater than, the first time my mom was like 'no, its way bigger than Darnassus' and she took the mouse out of my hand, zoomed past the night elf realm, past Kalimdor, to all of Azeroth, at my fingertips, begging to be explored  She was the #7 Mage on her realm, Fenris, back then  anyway....idk i havent opened RH yet whats going on out there?|2020-07-02 11:05:20

Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.”|2020-07-02 13:35:02

wq6g4c|hjudrj|hjudrj|2|(serious) Any lawyers on here that can help me out? So my ex-girlfriend has run off with a dog that I “gifted” her but is legally registered to my name (receipt, adoption papers, microchip). I offered to let her keep the dog over text and would like to be done with it, but she keeps threatening lawsuits unless I sign the papers her attorney sent me to say the dog is legally hers. Can I wipe my ass with the papers and mail them back to the attorney or is this illegal? Frivolous I know, but she’s taking it there|2020-07-02 13:58:15

worc99|hjudrj|hjudrj|7|Could be a short squeeze for TSLA this time. I’m afraid the run up in the past two day is reminiscent to the TSLA move on Feb from $700s to $969. Can’t be the same news/logic this time, it is possible traders that bought puts or shorted the stock might at the $1000 range are covering their positions to minimize the damage and thus in turn forced to buy TSLA shares. Definitely could see a massive move down in the coming weeks (maybe even a downgrade with a lower price target), but the inclusion of TSLA into the S&P500 and the possibility of profit is too enticing for investors.  We’ll see how good TSLA’s Q2 earnings results are in July 22nd. It could be a double top for sure, no one knows until big institutions do their moves.  The good news is that TSLA delivered 90,650 vehicles (better than expectations) which means it will for certain it could beat earnings. I think TSLA is a great company, but you might want to take profits to minimize risk. The stock’s RSI and MACD isn’t as dangerously overbought as the February short squeeze. Obviously tech/NASDAQ bubble bursting will trigger TSLA sell-off regardless of the company’s outlook.  **TL;DR:** Profit taking will happen today. Possible brief drop to the $1000s or the stock gets driven up by more developments in their battery tech (the main focus of Wall Street right now). Obviously bullish in the long run for TSLA since it will revolutionize auto (+ autonomous driving), electric utility, and renewable energy (solar) industries.

wp5exc|hjudrj|hjudrj|-6|I am itching to take some profits here but I think we take out the 323 high on SPY before we have another dip.  NVDA is chugging along to hit 400.  The V thesis is very much intact and taking out the highs in SPY by EOY is achievable.  SBUX was a good bet under 72.  Kept buying it up and I am now in the position to trim some into more strength.  AMZN is a pure beast.  Every time I order stuff "I think to myself, when do I ever see myself not ordering from Amazon?".  In fact, I am now subscribed to automatically receive frequently used products.   The dip we had last week feels like it was a setup.  Smart money needed to get in lower and got the change.    AZN hurry up and make a damn statement about your vaccine progress.  4 more years! Trump needs to win the election and keep the pressure on China and bringing back key supply chains to the US, Mexico, and Canada.   Stop all this blue wave crap.

You could play puts from 315 to 300? But it could just as easily reverse at 307 back to 315, tough to make bets against the "prevailing" trend without confirmation of reversal.|2020-07-02 14:35:57
