Ok if you can read you're doing great so far!   Now, go back in the FUTURES chart of that index and look at where we rallied from, and look at where we sold. Play those levels. In and out, quick trades, take your profits. Or buy end of day and sell at open, accordingly.

It turns out submissions are being auto-spammed with no reason. A significant number of them. Nothing in modlog. Doesn't say a mod did it. Wasn't one of our bots.  I looked through all the settings I could think of and nothing I tried would make submissions from certain people go through. Is reddit still shadowbanning people? Does anyone have any idea why a submission might say Removed on our end with no reason? It's not account age. The only thing I see is that some of the affected users say profane shit.  If anyone has ideas as to why this is happening and what I can do to stop it I'll poke at it. We have the "reddit spam filter" on the lowest setting as always.

He‚Äôs super anti establishment, but ... a little behind things at the moment.

When he sent that he didn‚Äôt know he had been robbed...  Later that night he let me know what happened. It‚Äôs brutal. He‚Äôs been out of work and it‚Äôs a ton of money. Can‚Äôt say what it is for anonymity‚Äôs sake that was stolen but holy crap. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs Karma or what.  Anyway, I feel better about my losses today. Not as bad as some.

9muqgc|jfwwhm|jfwwhm|4|The Market hates uncertainty. Trump winning would bring the markets down, but it would recover a lot faster because Trump has already been ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù   Biden, even if he was a 9000 iq genius, would still crash the market upon being elected. It would then slowly recover, and the ‚Äúnew policies‚Äù that get voted on will be catalyst for the market rising, or spiraling downwards   ‚ÄúThe market doesn‚Äôt care about red or blue, they only care about green‚Äù (forgot who said this quote)   And uncertainty is what Mr.Market hates, it has very little to do with the actual political party (of course some parties may bring more uncertainty than other)    So yeah, every 4 years, the market has a panic attack basically    Edit: guys! guys! can we please be a bit nicer?!

9o2a0v|jfwwhm|jfwwhm|-4|Media mavens mount surgical strikes from trapper keeper collages and online magazine racks  Cover girl cutouts throw up pop-up ads infecting victims with silicone shrapnel  Worldwide passenger pigeons deploy paratroopers  Now it's raining pornography, lovers take shelter  Post-production debutantes pursue you in NASCAR chariots  They construct ransom letters from biblical passages and bleed mascara into the holy water supplies  There is a war going on for your mind.  Industry insiders slang test tube babies to corporate crack heads  They flash logos and blast ghettos  Their embroidered neckties say "Stop Snitching"  Conscious rappers and whistle blowers get stitches made of acupuncture needles and marionette strings  There is a war going on for your mind  Professional wrestlers and vice presidents want you to believe them  The desert sky is their blue screen  They superimpose explosions They shout at you  "Pay no attention to the men behind the barbed curtain  Nor the craters beneath the draped flags Those hoods are there for your protection  And meteors these days are the size of corpses"  There is a war going on for your mind  #We are the insurgents.|2020-10-22 12:39:04
