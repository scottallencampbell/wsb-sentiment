tlhbzy|h07z0d|h07z0d|14|So, it seems like in the past few months, the bear vs bull battle in this sub went from being almost jovial and jokey to straight up venom from both sides. I’m chalking it up to new investors and subs to this sub reddit; but it’s not the WSB way. You never root for a fellow trader to fail, or even if you do, you shouldn’t spit absolute venom at them over the internet like a child. Yes we are silly, meme heavy and make dumb dumb crazy plays, but we shouldn’t encourage in fighting. If you disagree with someone else’s stance, post your position showing the opposite or ban. No need to act like a child and try to get nasty with internet strangers. You’re just devaluing the sub and making it a less enjoyable place for the rest of us.  We are all really in this together; if we could all make money that’d be super great.|2020-06-10 11:02:21

tlvu68|h07z0d|h07z0d|10|The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health have induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Financial conditions have improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.  The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.|2020-06-10 13:01:54

tldxhv|h07z0d|h07z0d|15|at 2:00pm, if the fed is keeping rates low for a long time.   market will rally by about 1-2% tomorrow and then crash straight down.  if the fed is planning to raise rates or is keeping rates low less than expected  Market will dump by about 1-2% tomorrow and then go straight up.   it sounds retarded and the opposite of what you expect, which should key you in on that it is correct. The reason being that if the fed is keeping rates low for a long time, it signals low confidence in the economy, while planning to raise rates signals strong confidence in the economy.   Retail is half a foot in this rally but institutional investors are still uber bearish. A bullish fed is the last step to send a gob flow of money sending SPY to 340.|2020-06-10 10:33:48

tlw49e|h07z0d|h07z0d|7|The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health have induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Financial conditions have improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.  The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.|2020-06-10 13:04:04

Output is expected to be 6.5 percent lower at the end of this year than it was in the final quarter of 2019.  **The new forecasts predict a much slower path back to economic strength than the Trump administration — and perhaps the stock market — seems to expect as the economy climbs out of a virus-spurred downturn.** The Fed skipped its quarterly economic summary in March as the pandemic gripped the United States, sowing uncertainty as business activity came to a near standstill.|2020-06-10 13:29:04

tlvrry|h07z0d|h07z0d|6|Statement:  The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health have induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Financial conditions have improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.  The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.  Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K. Quarles.|2020-06-10 13:01:22

tkoymu|h07z0d|h07z0d|3|If equities are the only place offering good yields then why the fuck would any dividend paying solid equity ever go down? Investors don’t give a fuck if it drops in the next 5 years, they all know MSFT, AAPL, KO etc will all be positive in the next decade so they don’t mind putting money in these equities and won’t sell. Therefore I don’t see why the solid blue chips would ever crash again. March was a liquidity crisis and everything fell as people needed cash to sort out virus outbreak but now everybody has cash and needs somewhere to store it with low/negative rates everywhere. Any bears want to argue this?  TLDR: Penny stocks and NKLA and ZM are all fuk, big cap is good. Pls give me counter points.|2020-06-10 06:13:41

We know this level of speculation has coincided with a sharp increase in the activity of retail investors.”  >Boockvar added the activity has been encouraged by a “zero rate” and “unlimited QE” environment, referring to the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing measures. Ahead of the central bank’s decision Wednesday, he’s not the only one laying blame.  >“In this tape, bankruptcies have become the flavor of the day,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “At what point will Jay Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve realize they have broken the market’s pricing mechanism? The bankruptcies are only a small part of the story.”|2020-06-10 06:59:02

tkrzel|h07z0d|h07z0d|14|Hey gang, I wrote this for night crew, so I apologize if you saw it then:  It's funny how when an investment fund has 30 million dollars and buys and drives the price up, it's a completely normal and textbook consequence of demand.  When 100,000 people each drop $300 in Robinhood and buys and drives the price up it's "a bubble".  I'm not saying people aren't goofy and dumb like buying Hertz and knowing how bankruptcy works. That's a consequence of the accessibility of the tech now.  I'm saying the fact that you're winning is hurting egos and feelings. Maybe some of these secret tea leaf readers lose a bit of shine if you realize it's really as simple as invest in companies you like.  Fuck dude I bought 10 share of iRobot because I like Roomba. Is it "MaNiPuLaTiOn"??? Is this the iRobot bubble? No, it turns out capital is just taxed less than labor and is inflation resistant. Put it on a smartphone and now it's not magic, and that makes old white men cranky.  Don't let em take those winnings from you. When you hit a lick, you take half and you drop it in high div yield ETFs and you never touch it again. If you run out of options money it doesn't matter you got that egg.  💰|2020-06-10 06:55:18

If Elon whipped his dick out and said “buy TSLA stock,” investors would be foaming at the mouth to buy it.  Despite the underwriting expenses, Tesla has no obligation to ever return money to shareholders. The share holders are also fine with Tesla returning no money since it’s been run like a non-profit company for years. Tesla could use the cash to build new factories, develop new cars, or just service their higher interest non-callable debt obligations.

tlw030|h07z0d|h07z0d|3|The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health have induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Financial conditions have improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.  The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.  Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K. Quarles.|2020-06-10 13:03:10

tl8v4b|h07z0d|h07z0d|6|lol Tesla @ 1k  420 was already a meme, 1000 is just plain silly.  That being said, I learned my lesson trying to fight the mighty Elon.  I just want to short Tesla, Zoom, BYND, SPACE etc. and retire early, but this market has no connection with value anymore, so I won't. Its all about being appealing to the retail investor, this is a trend by now and maybe retail is better in predicting the future by now.   We have almost same tools and information as institutes and hedge funds, a huge difference with the past. We have way more individual brainpower per average dollar invested, and we have more efficient ways to communicate. We act as the perfect neural network that gets smarter and bigger every day. Its kind of inevitable that we will outperform the market as a group at some point  In many industries, tech helped to cut the middleman because going straight from the producer to the consumer is better for both parties. Maybe this is what is going on here too, it would be in line with everything else in the world.   I am a bear for now, because this market is retarded and all of you are retards. But you are my retards <3|2020-06-10 09:42:48

However like any good summers day there are eventual storms that cloud your judgement.  The bear grins, foolishly believing it's their time that this, is, it.  You're sweating, debating whether the time to leave the call has finally arrived, or maybe this is just a test for which if you pass, even greater riches are around the corner.  That bear is creeping closer and closer.  So tell me...   Are you going to submit to that bear when he comes knocking down your picnic basket?

tl9rc1|h07z0d|h07z0d|7|Investment 101: Buy the dip. Buy the future value and not necessarily present value. Hold and use compound in your favor. Diversify and keep some percentage speculative based on your age. Use options to hedge. Always buy companies which have good public name in the beginning itself, uber is a classic example and tesla is another. These companies hardly fails. Never borrow to invest. Buy before the hype begins and sell when hype is there. Hype always end and reality kicks in always. This is very crucial. Example is nikola. If you didnt sell at 80 then you have made the biggest financial mistake. Buy spce because it's only play in space sector right now. This is also important.

The name itself warrants its place here, but I've done some pretty heavy DD, and they are setup to cash in on the clean vehicle movement in China. Possibly working with Tesla in the near future (I think they already work with a few of the same battery/parts suppliers?) 2100 cars ($33 million) were sold in their MEG hub in May, and that number is projected to increase for June. I don't normally advocate for dollar stocks, but this thing is going to pop this year as it's very undervalued. $2.50 calls for Jan are safe and cheap, sprinkle some in your portfolio and thank me later.

tlf7mp|h07z0d|h07z0d|7|this afternoon + tomorrow will be an epic trap for either bulls or bears.  if the fed is keeping rates low for a long time, we'll get a 1-2% rally tomorrow to trap the bulls before diving straight down. Because while the short term algo will bid up assets based on if rates = low, SPY = up, most players will soon realize the fed has low confidence in the economy and sell off soon after, sending SPY to 290.  If the fed is keeping rates shorter than expected, we will get a 1-2% pull back today/tomorrow to trap the bears before going straight up. Because short term algos will think rates up = stocks down, but people will soon realize fed has strong confidence in the economy and all that institutional capital on the sideline will pile in sending SPY to 350.

tkqsj0|h07z0d|h07z0d|2|Man, I miss these coming out on a regular basis. Bill Gross used to spit facts every month, but has been missing since last October.   “But can bull market equities be sustained even with additional easing on the part of Central Banks? Probably not, because Governors and Chairs of these presumably prescient institutions are becoming wise to the negative effects of rates at zero (or less) that literally rob small savers and larger financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies and pension funds of their ability to earn historically “guaranteed” carry that equate assets with liabilities and prevents them from earning an assumed return that avoids haircuts and even bankruptcy.”  https://williamhgross.com/investment-archive/|2020-06-10 06:39:51

tlw1s3|h07z0d|h07z0d|2|The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. **In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.**  The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  **To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.** In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations.

tlw22v|h07z0d|h07z0d|2|https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/fed-meeting-decision-interest-rates.html  The Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero and indicated that’s where they’ll stay as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.  Along with the rate decision, central bankers projected Wednesday that the economy will shrink 6.5% in 2020, a year that saw an unprecedented halting of business activity in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic. However, 2021 is expected to show a 5% gain followed by 3.5% in 2022.  The central bank repeated its commitment from the April meeting that it “expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”  The Fed also said it will continue to increase its bond holdings, targeting Treasury purchases at $80 billion a month and mortgage-backed securities at $40 billion.|2020-06-10 13:03:36

Back; If you did this every day for the last month you'd of been up 20%, where if you just lump summed it and pulled out now, you'd be up 15%. So a 5% more gain with this method for WTI.  Theory; The algos love this time for this ticker for dump/pump. Time to see if this holds true for the last 3 months.  This is true autism btw. I get weird about patterns, and I swear theres a pattern here. 50% of the time you're positive, 50% you're down. but the times your positive outweight the downs by a 3/2 factor.

tkng7v|h07z0d|h07z0d|-2|Top story on drudge is increasing cerveza sickness, which the inherent gay bearness in me has noticed for the last couple weeks, particularly in freedom loving states like Texas, Arizona, Florida.    Also noticed that gay Michigan with hard lockout has way less new cases than freedom loving Ohio whose cases are flat.  Which is the opposite from the start of the epidemic.  The gay Iranians are also experiencing a true second wave per google statistics map.  I also dreamed last night of my wife’s wealthy good friend’s husband (who my wife is probably fucking when she says she’s taking the kids to their pool for the day while i work) and his comments near the previous bottom when he said “i’m down a million, A MILLION DOLLARS, what do I do?”. Sheepishly I said that I also converted gay too late and i lost a few orders of magnitude less than that on late FD calls  When I awoke I remembered my post Brr gay FOMO which I then gave into by buying cruise ships and IWM value stocks which were rewarding but now i’m torn because I don’t know what the Fed will say or do, and if they Brrr more then have to have equities to capture asset inflation, but also Trump finally looks as done as my wife’s cooze after satisfying her friends husband, so will the market be happy when Sleepy Lyin Joe wins and the democrats roll over the Repubs?  I tried to trade premarket but unlike webull, Fidelity encourages restful sleep until 7am, and also since only a handful of meme stocks trade liquidly, i’ve done well premarket like 20% of the time anyway, especially since stocks only go up, then when i buy at work before noon they go down but recover by 4pm|2020-06-10 05:50:17
