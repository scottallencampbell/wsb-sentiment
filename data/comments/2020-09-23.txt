It's an app that turns on 2 cameras and connects them, and they have like 50 competitors (and there isn't a great model for profitability as very few people will pay for video chat).   Today, their p/e ratio is like 1300.  1300.  It would take 1,300 FUCKING YEARS FOR ZOOM TO EARN THE MONEY THAT THEIR STOCK IS SELLING FOR TODAY.     To put that into perspective, 1,300 years ago was the year fucking ~700. This is the year the Chinese invented gunpowder. Fucking  Tiberius III was the God damned emperor of byzantine.    If zoom was founded in the fucking Byzantine empire by fucking Tiberius III, it would've taken them until fucking today just to break even on what they were charging for their fucking stock notes, which presumably were chiseled into fucking stone.  That's how fucking overvalued zoom is, and yet it jumped another 7% today because "oooooh stay at home stocks."   It is absolutely the most absurd stock in the history of the market, and it's hard to even conceptualize just how fucking retarded it is.|2020-09-23 10:30:45

A video conferencing company that was a March meme. Zoom is worth 145ish billion dollars. Combine all the big pharmacies cvs, Walgreens, rite aid and you’d have to throw an extra 40 billion in to equal it out. Oh and you’d get a huge health insurer with cvs for free too.  These drug stores sell the drugs that people have to take that everyone complains are super expensive.

6bstly|iy7eev|iy7eev|20|Your wife brushes her hair as you watch silently from the bed. This is when you find her most beautiful: she’s in her nightly routine, humming softly, wearing ancient pajamas she got one Christmas when she was still a girl.  “What are you looking at?” The question startles you. You stare at her like this most nights, and she never notices. But now she smiles at you—or rather her reflection in the mirror does—with an inquisitive eyebrow raised.  “Nothing much,” you try to joke, casually. But she turns around immediately, to look over her shoulder at you: “What’s wrong?” The gravity of her tone briefly catches you off guard, but you collect yourself: “What? Nothing’s wrong.” She stares at your face a bit longer, and then satisfied you aren’t lying—because she trusts you more than any human being she’s ever known—she turns back to her mirror and hair brushing.  And you know why tonight, of all nights, she noticed you watching her: she could sense your fear. She doesn’t know what SPY is. Or a call. But something primal in her knows what you did with those things, and how it is eating you alive inside. Because she loves you.  Suddenly, you realize fully that you do not deserve the connection that allowed her to sense that in you, the connection that you lied in the face of. As her humming resumes, you start drafting your goodbye.|2020-09-23 10:45:40

6c7m83|iy7eev|iy7eev|5|Gamestop looks so fucking strong. Consolidating today on low volume is looking good and healthy after the last run-up.  I just don't see how shorts are maintaining their position. Most of them are underwater, they are paying insanely high borrowing fees, and there is the looming threat of having their position closed anytime if there is a vote regarding Cohen.  What is your short thesis? That it will drop to $0 even though there is $12/share in cash? That Cohen wont continue to support the price even though he clearly supports it at $8.6 and you can assume he will continue to do so. That GME somehow = Blockbuster? That Amazon or Walmart will be the default place for customers even though that's been proven not to be the case.  Bulls have Cohen, console cycle (large portion will be physical consoles), 3 analyst upgrades in the last 2 weeks, $12/share in the bank, Reduced SG&A and inventories to help cut costs, restructured debt/upgrade in credit rating, and plenty to metrics in their favor such as;  Market Cap is incredibly low \~$650M- share price will continue to rise to properly represent the true valuation of GME which is probably around $2B considering the sum-of-all-parts. Share price will have to rise to over $30 to achieve a $2B MC.Price-to-sales ratio is woefully low, currently around 0.11 - This is way off. Investors giving GME 10c for every $1 of sales.. From a value perspective this is a big opportunity as other similar companies are trading with price/sales much higher. Take Bestbuy, trading 0.6 price/sales. This is important because if you were to give GME a 0.6 price/sales ratio then the share price would skyrocket!  There is honestly a lot going for GME, its been the hottest stock on the index all month, which has been the worst month since MARCH, and that's saying something.Some people may look at the rise in share price over the last 3 weeks and think they missed the boat. I disagree. I think you can still have a good 2-3bag at this (with shares) and that is not including the short squeeze possibility.  I am long GME since Cohen entered.|2020-09-23 12:45:57

Are people just upset that reduction in cost and increase in energy density won’t be fully realised for 3 years?  What did you expect this shit takes time.   Competitors already can’t match Tesla on range and costs of battery can you imagine how much further ahead they will be in 2-3 years time.  They basically just gave you the roadmap of how they will stay far ahead of the pack for years to come.|2020-09-23 05:29:51

Then they make a two hour presentation about how fucking difficult it is to produce authentic holograms. Throughout the presentation they highlight how fucking rad it would be to have hologram technology, but again, it’s really difficult and years away.   Most investors ask themselves, “What the fuck am I supposed to do with this information?”  Fanboys yell, “IF iNvEsToRs uNdeRstOod tHe PreSenTaTiOn, AAPLE wOuLD SkYRoCkeT.”  I didn’t watch Battery Day, but this is what I took from it from the comments.|2020-09-23 09:14:06

When he sees your mom, he will yell "taxi, taxi!". Now, why does he do this? The answer is actually quite simple. Your mom is so fat she is the size of a taxi, and the yellow raincoat she is theoretically wearing is the same color as a taxi. Therefore, the man mistakes her for a taxi. So, what has this hypothetical scenario shown us? It has shown us that your mom is very, very, fat. Boom! Once again destroyed with facts and logic.|2020-09-23 08:21:33

And then heading into election, volatility should increase either before or after the shitstorm that is a brewing after election night.|2020-09-23 12:21:46

6bl3m7|iy7eev|iy7eev|5|If you're not bullish on Tesla here's why...  You still think of it as a car manufacturer.   This is a tech company that is run by autistic fucks that have a clear vision of what the future will look like: sustainable energy, solar roofs, battery powered EVERYTHING.   They are a growth company that is building massive infrastructure on nearly every continent to gain distribution efficiencies. Their brand is elite and highly desirable. They are doing literally everything smarter...their factories, their battery technology, their software programming.   Even if you aren't seeing the thousands of Tesla's on the streets remember: TSLA is way more than a car company. Bring the hate I don't care... batteries are super important to the global future and Tesla just announced a 50% cost reduction and weight/safety improvements for the most expensive component of every future moving vehicle. They're solving problems that your pea sized brain hasn't even thought of yet.   TLDR: Elon is living in 2035 and will make TSLA the most valuable company ever|2020-09-23 09:40:40

6bblvr|iy7eev|iy7eev|2|Might see a similar price move in TSLA as you saw on 9/21 as people flush their shares post news... You will likely once again see dip buying... because TSLA. However, I get the feeling the reason the share price hasn't fallen off a cliff pre-market is the understanding that liquidating large position in pre-market will lead to a lower over sale price due to lack of liquidity. Waiting for the market open will allow for a better cost average of large block sales... It might be a REALLY good opportunity to play a quick in an out dead cat bounce..|2020-09-23 08:10:37

Then March saw a drop to mid $300’s and everyone thought the bubble popped. Enter face melting rally, 5:1 split, leading to today. If this stock has taught you anything.

6babl7|iy7eev|iy7eev|1|are shares and fds a better strat the just leaps? i feel like shares do a better job of storing and growing money long term, and fds do a better job of getting returns quick. Leaps kinda are shitty cuz if there is a fat drop, 50% of the leap could get eaten, where as with shares and fd's, ur fds become fuk and ur shares become light bagholds (cuz its fuckin shares). Only reservation i have about shares and fd's is that theta eats the fuck outta fd's and this market is manipulated where and earnings beat wont reflect in the price till a few days after or somn, so timing fd's is hard. Monthlies also get eaten pretty hard by theta... maybe the way is shares and leaps... but then i dont get the retard gains... man oh man, decisions|2020-09-23 07:56:54

6bm4lt|iy7eev|iy7eev|1| 500 calls on tesla are back boyz!!!  **GROWING TECH LEAD:** Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner upgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $500, up from $400. The analyst noted that the company's Battery Day showcased an "impressive trajectory" for Tesla's technology, capacity and cost, which should help accelerate the world's shift to electric vehicles and extend the company's lead "considerably."  While investor expectations into the event were high, Tesla's plan to achieve 56% reduction in battery cost over the next three years came in "considerably better than anticipated, and could materially boost its volume and margin outlook," Rosner added. The analyst also increased Tesla's earnings estimates to incorporate lower battery costs and higher volumes, and said he now sees the company delivering 2M-plus vehicles and generating $15 in earnings per share by 2025. With the stock down as traders "sell the news," longer-term investors should take advantage of weakness to buy Tesla as the best way to invest in vehicle electrification, he contended|2020-09-23 09:49:31

He could have announced flying cars and it would have drilled today. Expectations for Elon are unattainable now. Just being the world's most gifted inventor isn't enough anymore. Ffs he's integrating single press chassis with batteries. He already got a patent earlier this year to apply circuitry DIRECTLY INTO PANELS, now we see what the applications can be.
