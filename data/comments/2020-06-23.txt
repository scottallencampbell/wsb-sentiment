He got so pissed off at stock market, he later said: "I can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men". Newton was one of us, a true retard. Making 100% profit and losing all of it at the end. He belongs to this sub.  >*Back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in the South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that the market was getting out of hand. Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pocketing a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much higher price — and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in \[2002-2003's\] money. For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words 'South Sea' in his presence.*|2020-06-23 13:32:18

We see Q3/Q4 coming back to 70% compared to last year, and 2021 will be about the same (70-75% of 2019 sales).  For some context, this is the auto companies being pedal to the metal on new programs- they couldnt possibly move any faster. They havent laid off salary employees in any large numbers, so there are more people working on this new stuff. So quite literally this is a best case estimate for most of the industry.

We hope before fall we'll have this for distribution."  Testifying in front of the Committee on Energy and Commerce on the importance of coronavirus testing, Fauci said the development of safe and effective vaccines is most important. "It puts the nail in the coffin of the virus," he stated.  Fauci noted there are several vaccines in program now and "one of them will enter phase 3 study in July. Others will follow one, two or three months later. We are taking the financial risk to be able to be ahead of the game and to make it available to American public. And it will be until the end of 2020 and in the beginning of 2021," he said|2020-06-23 10:46:55

For the bank stress test they probably already know whether its gonna be bad or good, am I'm betting wall street has an idea already as well.  So either A: its gonna be bad, and they wanna get the fuck out before everyone else finds out, or B: its going to be good (or faked), and at that point I'm not sure what the play would be.  Do they dump before it comes out and trap all the bears so they can reposition for the moonshot?  Or do they just buy even harder in anticipation and then sell the news?|2020-06-23 13:17:30

vruion|hebygw|hebygw|2|Stocks picks from space? Yup, that happened!  In the early days of Walmart, its founder would monitor how stores were doing by counting the cars in the parking lot.  Two brothers used satellite images to count the cars in parking lots of Walmart, McDonalds etc to collect data and to predict a corporate's profitability. They started a business called "Remote sensing" and supported big banks with this approach. Ultimately became rich.

Sure, there are micro-reactions when things 'come to be' that are expect, but they're just that: micro-reactions.  It's the unknown shit that has a dramatic impact on the market.|2020-06-23 08:15:00

vqzg2h|hebygw|hebygw|4|2 things this morning! Ok maybe 3:  1. Look at the yearly Spy... Top of that rebound was June 8 at 321.78.... all technical indicators show a downward trend from there...   Also note that QE and the Fed are doing this... otherwise we would be significantly lower... so all that Fed power can’t make ATH... if you believe recovery is going well then QE should reduce... thoses 2 things are inversely correlated  2. That China trade deal thing  It’s a strong possibility that’s it’s gonna end at some point... this was just a hint or a testing the water... maybe they were in talk with china on something like the 2 canadians « spy » detained over there and they didn’t wanna move and at some point USA said... fuck you deal is done... so they release this and then maybe China accepted to move so they took it back...  They can do anything they want and they know how to move the media...  I believe Trump Campaign will be hard and this will be his ultimate to cut ties with China to gain traction in the run...  3. Here is the list of what I expect to bring market down  - Q2 release= reality check of the real damage done  - covid up tick paired with flu season fucking up hospitals and forcing the hand of governor to take action  - China trade deal / election seasons  -July end of free check / congress not agreeing on extending the money|2020-06-23 10:02:35

If you kept your job, it signals that you’re a winner, a top performer who is critical to the success of a company. If you were laid off, you were dead weight.  When filling open positions, companies will absolutely want to hire the guy coming from another firm where he remained employed throughout this pandemic.   I’m cynical and highly doubt companies will take pity on you just because of the circumstances. They already wanted you to have at least 4 years of professional experience before graduating college, why would they change?  What’s a head hunter firm I can short?|2020-06-23 08:54:14

vrg69r|hebygw|hebygw|2|saw some comments earlier from newer traders not knowing why their long options are red  think of it this way, OTM options are the same as stocks, their price (beyond intrinsic value) is dictated by the market. it can change any time for any reason (this can get especially wild for far OTM options which rely heavily on supply/demand for pricing), the greeks can help you understand the change, but they won't always help you predict it.  you need to manage your expectations when buying OTM, they're good for scalping an overnight/quick move but for holding them long term, don't expect to make $ unless they go ITM. most of the greeks are working against you.   a decent alternative to long calls is selling an OTM put spread and using that premium to buy a call spread, if you structure this trade correctly (for a net credit) you've got most of the greeks working for you and your position has significantly more delta ($$$) than a plain bull put spread.   tldr: stop buying calls and then bitching in this thread about losing money you absolute retards|2020-06-23 12:19:31

vrtqv5|hebygw|hebygw|2|After making some good tendies on ZM, feels like that rally is losing steam. The next one for me is PRPL, and another poster provided some solid DD here.   Separately, in the company's update released a handful of days ago, they noted that the cash balance improved by nearly $34MM in one month due to online orders. That's pretty remarkable and assuming only 1/2 of that is related to net profit from sales of new mattresses (vs. other net working capital changes such as inventory declining, payables increasing, etc), that means an incremental $15MM of new earnings a month, or close to 30 cents a share.   The company's poised to blow out Q2 earnings and margins are going to ramp due to DTC transition.   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gyrwyb/purple_mattress_will_smash_earnings_2_million/|2020-06-23 14:08:28

vr7th9|hebygw|hebygw|-2|Number 1 in infections and deaths. She is the dumbest bitch. Actually per million we are right in the middle of the pack, not even near the top. Politicians are idiots. It’s a pandemic and virus, people will die. I don’t know a single person in my life or in my community that cares about this shit. They wear the masks when shopping and enjoy their life outdoors.   Outrage for Tulsa but they can have millions protesting without masks every evening. Dumb ass people I swear. Virus is no threat, follow the guidelines. Live your life. And I work on the vaccine|2020-06-23 11:11:55

Because you are being lied too so you click on cnn more and they get increased money for advertising and increased ratings, oh and orange man bad, kind of funny this is an election year.   You all are a bunch of zombies being lied too.   Source: Google.com’s own covid death rate chart using published cdc numbers. You can go to google and see for yourself, type in covid death rates and see the official charts and check your own state and how bad you are being lied too as well.

vqwu61|hebygw|hebygw|1|COVID testimony doc was largely useless. Aside from:  "An analysis of preliminary data from 1,063 patients enrolled in the ACTT-1 indicated that those who received remdesivir had a 32 percent faster time to recovery, a median of 11 days compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. Additionally, the analysis found that remdesivir may benefit survival, although the mortality data did not reach statistical significance. A mortality rate of 7.1 percent was observed for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.9 percent for placebo. These initial findings were published on May 22, 2020, in the New England Journal of Medicine. "  Remdesivir was added to hospital treatment guidelines on 5/12. This may be old news.  Although the 11AM testimony is probably going to be a dump, there will be a discussion of vaccines and a possible pump instead.|2020-06-23 09:40:14
