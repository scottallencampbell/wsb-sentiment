"Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy.

wedupj|hhxaym|hhxaym|4|So I see SPY 298p/287p 7/1 put credit spread that gives me $111 in premium, requiring me to give $1,100.00 in collateral   Assume I have $25k in my account, I can buy 22 of these spreads for a fat 2k+ in premium using majority of my capital as collateral. Literally cannnot go tits up right?   Sure there is the risk of SPY dropping to $298 or less before EOD tomorrow, but as long as it's above it, I get that $2k awarded to me. Doesn't matter if it's anything like 298.50, 299 or up, I'll get that $2k?  Obviously not gonna do that, just testing the waters with smol boy put credit spreads currently, just thinking of the hypothetical. Smooth-brained me is trying to wrap my head around it.

In case anyone wonders why there was a big green dildo before market close today:  >Hedge Funds Are Rushing to Get Out of Bearish U.S. Stock Bets - Bloomberg   >   >Fast-money hedge funds are rushing to cover their bearish U.S. stock bets even as the equity rally threatens to break down. Net short positions in the contracts were at their highest in almost a decade as the U.S. equity rebound pushed the benchmark back toward record territory.   >   >Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding in the $266 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust had fallen to 4.9% Friday from 6.7% at the end of May, according to data from IHS Markit. Meanwhile, the beta of the Hedge Fund Research Macro/CTA Index -- which tracks funds synonymous with trend-following quant strategies -- to the S&P 500, is back above zero for the first time since March. That suggests CTA funds have been boosting their exposure to U.S. equities and closing short positions.|2020-06-29 15:11:40

wcsrf4|hhxaym|hhxaym|2|VNET going to moon today. 239k shares bought AH on Friday at 24.56, which was it's current ATH.  Backed by Blackstone, kept inching up all last week with the market selling off.  It's just waiting for a green day for $27.  Only 496 owners on RH right now.   Anyone else in it, and when are you selling? I'm mostly in $24-$25C for July 17th I bought at around .70|2020-06-29 05:37:15

When I saw other customers successfully change operations to save money and become more efficient, they just kept spending like a rich kid at his first strip-club.  It was just always crazy.

wec97e|hhxaym|hhxaym|2|I am puzzled by the action on some stocks.  NVDA is struggling to stay green on a day when the market is up big.  Today people decide to sell NVDA? They did not think it was time to sell at 380+?  What about all those people who bought at 380+?  What is wrong with them losing money.    Targets have been raised above 400.  People are dumping at 364?  The only thing I can explain is that someone knows NVDA earnings are going to suck wind and they are unloading big positions.|2020-06-29 14:26:49

I wanted to set a stop limit, so I put the order in as:  STP $1.60 LMT $1.58  I assumed that when the value of the option got to $1.6, it would try to sell it for $1.58.  Before I knew it, the option was worth $1.45 and my limit had not triggered, so I panic sold it.  should I have made the LMT smaller? Maybe STP $1.60, LMT $1.50?|2020-06-29 08:58:12

wdoeo7|hhxaym|hhxaym|2|So now that I'm almost entirely theta gang and now that I'm selling covered calls on MSFT instead of KODK and MGM, I should probably do more analysis of which calls to sell.   All I want is to keep banking premiums on calls that expire worthless.  Should I keep selling FDs on Monday morning like I am with OTM strikes and taking 50 bucks here, 60 bucks there, or should I be selling longer options for a month or two months and taking a few hundred at a time, but less often? I know that I will get more in overall premiums by selling further out, but if MSFT starts going back up the calls are more likely to wind up ITM and assigned than if I do FDs, and I'll lose out on the difference between the close and strike.

wdq9yk|hhxaym|hhxaym|2|Simple DD: In a few hours or a few days, retail investors here are going to realize that a few large brands dropping ads on the FB networks doesn’t mean much - they would do so anyway before November. As The election is coming up, and ad networks are about to get flooded with Super PAC money, and ad CPC will go up (what it costs to place ads as you’re in competition with Poltiical ad money to try and buy ads for your Bear/Bull petting zoo, and the Political PACs have wayyy more money to burn.) FB will be fine. Bought FB 7/17 calls at the bottom of the early morning sell off and wish I had gotten more. If there’s another dip tomorrow I may do so.   Positions: FB 7/17 220c  Edit:  Also got into BABA 7/17 217.5c   And DOCU 7/17 but sold these already.|2020-06-29 11:36:42

You know were in a bull run but found another retard who lies to you and tells you you're not as retarded as you think. Fuck your fd spy puts and fuck your “morality”.

BBBY, FB and LEVI calls all hit after buying the dip at open. Will probably pick up PEP puts after repo today. Thankfully got lucky on FB calls over puts.

Totally natural virus that causes your cells to produce tentacles so that it can invade cell to cell directly. It doesn't have to wait for the cell to die before it can infect multiple other cells, simultaneously.
