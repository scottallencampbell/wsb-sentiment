"Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy.

wedupj|hhxaym|hhxaym|4|So I see SPY 298p/287p 7/1 put credit spread that gives me $111 in premium, requiring me to give $1,100.00 in collateral   Assume I have $25k in my account, I can buy 22 of these spreads for a fat 2k+ in premium using majority of my capital as collateral. Literally cannnot go tits up right?   Sure there is the risk of SPY dropping to $298 or less before EOD tomorrow, but as long as it's above it, I get that $2k awarded to me. Doesn't matter if it's anything like 298.50, 299 or up, I'll get that $2k?  Obviously not gonna do that, just testing the waters with smol boy put credit spreads currently, just thinking of the hypothetical. Smooth-brained me is trying to wrap my head around it.

wd16fj|hhxaym|hhxaym|2|Man, the way CHK operates on the drilling side, I don't know how they survived this long.  They spent cash like it was infinite leading up to the 2015 oil crash, during the crash, after the crash, same with 2019-2020.  When I saw other customers successfully change operations to save money and become more efficient, they just kept spending like a rich kid at his first strip-club.  It was just always crazy.  So now bankruptcy, and because the world is confusing, their stock will probably skyrocket.|2020-06-29 07:37:47

wdoeo7|hhxaym|hhxaym|2|So now that I'm almost entirely theta gang and now that I'm selling covered calls on MSFT instead of KODK and MGM, I should probably do more analysis of which calls to sell.   All I want is to keep banking premiums on calls that expire worthless.  Should I keep selling FDs on Monday morning like I am with OTM strikes and taking 50 bucks here, 60 bucks there, or should I be selling longer options for a month or two months and taking a few hundred at a time, but less often? I know that I will get more in overall premiums by selling further out, but if MSFT starts going back up the calls are more likely to wind up ITM and assigned than if I do FDs, and I'll lose out on the difference between the close and strike.

wdq9yk|hhxaym|hhxaym|2|Simple DD: In a few hours or a few days, retail investors here are going to realize that a few large brands dropping ads on the FB networks doesn‚Äôt mean much - they would do so anyway before November. As The election is coming up, and ad networks are about to get flooded with Super PAC money, and ad CPC will go up (what it costs to place ads as you‚Äôre in competition with Poltiical ad money to try and buy ads for your Bear/Bull petting zoo, and the Political PACs have wayyy more money to burn.) FB will be fine. Bought FB 7/17 calls at the bottom of the early morning sell off and wish I had gotten more. If there‚Äôs another dip tomorrow I may do so.   Positions: FB 7/17 220c  Edit:  Also got into BABA 7/17 217.5c   And DOCU 7/17 but sold these already.|2020-06-29 11:36:42
