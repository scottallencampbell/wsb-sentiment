We'll open red on wednesday and drill until 11:30 before beginning to recover. Slight fade into afternoon. Big gap up thursday. Selloff. Gap up to 340 friday morning before a 2% slide into the weekend for coronafest pt 3.   &#x200B;  I'm tryna get on my jordykins wizard shiet.

This turd has been floating around 140s for over a year. It’s gonna stay that way for a while because investors would rather buy shit like msft Apple amd etc etc.   If your holding OTM calls that are barely a month or two out, close the fuckers and buy something with big pp energy.

A.) **Incredibly optimistic** - You'll never find them feeling down, always having a positive outlook.   B.) **Consistent** - You can always expect the exact same thing every single day.   C.) **Strength** - They are unbelievably strong. Could easy pick up a city bus.      That's what this market is. It's a retard.

hbcydv|f26vnw|f26vnw|4|So absolutely real question here: who in the fuck writes and evaluates really stupid OTM calls such that people with no idea what they are doing are capable of making money? I bought in MSFT 200 3/20, sold early for a decent percentage wise profit and spent the earnings and most of the previous equity on 210 3/20. It’s still FAR OTM, but I’ve made like an 80% gain on a call that should realistically be getting more fucked by theta decay than it should be worth, as it is still pretty shit odds that it will actually hit. How do the people SELLING these calls actually turn a profit, given that most of them never even exercise?|2020-02-11 10:48:42

hbu5ri|f26vnw|f26vnw|3|SPCE DD thread  I think SPCE is cool af and in the future IF they manage to actually make commercial space flights they'll become rich af along with long time shareholders.  Once they start making flights they'll make more spaceships, the more spaceships they build the more revenue and more stonks. Also improving their technology could make it that they can fly more people in one spaceship thus lowering the ticket price and opening to a broader market.  The bet is in if their scientific part of being able to fly in space goes well  and also in all the burocracy that is needed to get approved.  I think that this stock is to be held long term and will take some years to blossom(like 5 years for space flights to become a "common thing").  This stock is either going literally to the moon or underground but that shit is cool af so I'm willing to bet on it.   Gonna invest my father money on it.|2020-02-11 13:39:10

This **low interest rate environment may limit the ability of central banks to reduce policy interest rates enough to support the economy during a downturn.** **With this concern in mind, we have been conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.** Public engagement is at the heart of this effort. Through our *Fed Listens* events, we have been hearing from representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. The February *Monetary Policy Report* shares some of what we have learned. The insights we have gained from these events have informed our framework discussions, as reported in the minutes of our meetings. We will share our conclusions when we finish the review, likely **around the middle of the year**."

hbkio1|f26vnw|f26vnw|-6|Hello autists! I've been following this sub for a little bit now and I think I'm finally ready to embrace my inner gambler. I have a couple thousand I can put towards my first options play and I want to buy MSFT calls for 3/27 or 4/17 at $210. Autism aside, is this actually not a bad play? Thinkorswim says IV is 30.69% and the IV Percentile is 95%...is that a good? How can I determine if IV crush is already priced in? Thanks in advance for getting me closer to unlimited tendies!  (Before anyone says...I know I don't know everything about options and I know it's risky but I'm only risking the money I'm putting in for now and I don't think I'll ever really get the hang of options if all I do is read, read, read and never actually put that reading into practice)|2020-02-11 12:02:25
