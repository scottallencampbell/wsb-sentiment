lwzxj8|r12ms8|r12ms8|7|Next FOMC meeting is on 12/14 and 12/15.     Today we got jobs data showing the fewest new unemployment claims since 1969. We also got inflation data showing the highest PCE increase since 1991.     Given these facts, and the way in which inflation tends to disproportionately hurt the working class, the Fed would have to be absolute villains to not speed up tapering at that FOMC meeting. I know y'all don't usually look more than one week ahead, but it's worth considering that we could be in for a fairly hawkish Christmas.|2021-11-24 10:23:30

lxaaoz|r12ms8|r12ms8|3|AXSM options trade: Just sold a Jan 37.50 Diagonal for 2.25 premium. That raised my share value from $35.00 plus that strike premium of $6.00 to $37.50 plus the new $2.25 premium.  So those 200 shares, originally purchased for $25.00 are now worth up to $37.50 plus a total of $8.25 in combined monthly call premiums. I like that trade.  And if the AXS 05 approval doesn't come by year end I'll kick out the calls to Feb when those options become available and either get a bigger $37.50 premium or we'll kick it up to the $40 strike and take another two or three bucks.  I strongly suggest buying and holding AXSM for the eventual FDA approval of the expected multi billion dollar per year AXS 05 followed by the April 30 FDA date for AXS 07.  This is one of the most rare, best YOLO trades you will ever have a shot at. Because of the unknown timing of the approval, I suggest you do as I have been, and buy some shares and sell contracts against a portion of your position so you get paid a very large premium while you wait.|2021-11-24 11:31:12

Elon (MemeGod)  did a big service web-spreading the idea of electric vehicles - but Tesla are strictly status cars, and WAY less than 1% of the population is EVER going to buy one.  No one on WSB wants to admit it. Tesla is fucking lala land. Jesus - DEFINITELY make money on the meme if you can, while you can, how  you can -  because there aint NOTHING else there.. just irrational and fanatical cult nerd mass-wank.  No one wants to mention this (folk get angry and fanatical, dont they just) - so I thought I'd make the statement.. the MemeGod aint got nothing except mouth. Tesla going nowhere, is the bottom line.  Enjoy while it lasts. Elon getting a kick and dont give a fuck.. lot of investors especially retailers throw money at influencers like that. Nothing else happening. It's hollow.|2021-11-24 11:53:29

People will say ‚Äúya but Intel cpus suck !‚Äù  Well, that‚Äôs somewhat true - they don‚Äôt compete in the mobile sector anymore and that is where the money is.   So why do I think Intel is primed for big growth in the next 3-5 years ?  They are going to open up their fabs just like TSM. They are the only other company on the planet with the technology and know how to make the best CPUs.  They will get out of the business of designing their own silicon and instead become the TSM of the West and you‚Äôll have every company that wants their own silicon fabbing it at Intel.   Microsoft has already started designing their own silicon.  Everyone will get in on it. The days of universal CPUs are coming to an end.

lx8srm|r12ms8|r12ms8|0|QS has a battery prototype that is far better than anything on the market. They say it will be cheaper to produce due to no lithium anodes.   This means they can charge a higher price and have a MUCH higher profit margin than any batter company now.   Their battery is so good I predict it will enable electric logistics and freight operations. Also it can scale down to fit in a cellphone. The global battery market is ~$300 billion, in ten years QS will have a huge share of that and will have revenue >$100 billion annually. Mark my words|2021-11-24 11:21:32

This year with supply chain issue, chip shortages and prime day happening in July like our forefathers intended, Q4 results in January will probably suck compared to last year.

lxq8yq|r12ms8|r12ms8|-8|Right. So, gay men come in a variety of flavors. You've got the queens and twinks, sure. But then you've got the outdoorsy, more masculine, conservative sort.   The Ranger is a popular choice in that aggregate. It's less flamboyant than something like a Jeep Wrangler. It offers the utility of a pickup, but it's also a cute, simple, tidy thing. Especially the older ones.   [Look at this truck](https://file.kelleybluebookimages.com/kbb/base/house/1998/1998-Ford-Ranger%20Super%20Cab-FrontSide_FTRGESPL971_506x375.jpg). Just picture taking your boyfriend out in to the desert on a camping trip. The sun is setting, the desert heat is starting to abate, and the fire is crackling. Your twink goes to the bed of your truck to get another Zima from the cooler. ["News" by Dire Straits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG86XKaNj0Y) is playing on the radio. You put your hand on the small of his back, and blow on the nape of his neck. He shudders. With your other hand, you reach around the front and undo his wranglers. They fall to the sand.   Under that [gorgeous orange and pink Sonoran desert sky](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/arizona-desert-landscape-at-sunset-picture-id1204705361?k=20&m=1204705361&s=612x612&w=0&h=MP9nLE9gb8LLyI25O8VFmrweu0IdbBe49qgFwLiOKzw=), you take a deep breath of fresh air and survey nature's majesty. Bob Ross himself couldn't have painted a more glorious scene to behold. You feel a hand grasp your satchel. It's your twink. His back is arched expectantly, and he's bracing himself one armed over the tailgate of your yellow Ford Ranger while he reaches between his legs to pull your manhood inside him. He's desperate for it, so you won't keep him waiting. You release your breath, close your eyes and enter him. It's dry, so you need to push. This is going to be rough, but your twink is ready for you. He wants it rugged. And so you go to town under that picture perfect desert sunset. When you explode in him on that last animalistic thrust and let out a final, satisfied grunt, there is no big to do about it. You wipe the sweat from your brow, take a swig of crisp, refreshing Zima, and climb with your twink on to the sleeping bag in the bed of your truck. He collapses on your chest. And together, you watch the last moments as the sky fades to darkness and the stars own the night.  And there can be no doubt; yes, the Ford Ranger is super gay.|2021-11-24 13:14:42
