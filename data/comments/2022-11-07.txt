vgj219|yojc6f|yojc6f|11|$200 is now resistance for TSLA.  SPY is sitting at a pattern downside pivot point right now and the NASDAQ has rallied. While TSLA caught some of that upward movement, it's been stuck below $200 most of the time and has underrun the market today by a wide overall margin. So we have positive beta association, new resistance, and the stock is catching the downside deeper even with a strong volume rally on the market.  Not a good Tesla bull situation.  I'm curious to see where SPY goes from here, as the election is a big unknown. With a solid upswing, maybe TSLA can change this situation... without that, though, it's not a good situation for TSLA.  TSLA has limited support down through 190/185... below that, it's no-man's land on the chart until 150.|2022-11-07 14:23:34

vejcfz|yojc6f|yojc6f|28|Let me tell you a tale...  There once lived a generation of sweet summer bulls. Shoulder to shoulder they stood, and they all held the line. They bought and they bought, because fear they had not. They knew that stocks only go up, and that Tesla would soon fill their cup. They screamed and they shouted that midterms the market surely loves, and that soon the Fed would be doves. The brave bulls marched along, with visions of lambo's in their head...but soon the slaughterhouse doors slammed closed and they knew that they would soon be dead.   If only they had opened their eyes! For big tech had already began to die. European markets had continued to burn, and China too began to turn. Chip makers said no more phones, and gas makers too, said no more warm homes. Companies began the layoffs, and the bulls really should have stayed off. But then it was too late, the plan was complete. The Rich had won, and inflation was done...for money?? The Bulls had none.|2022-11-07 05:51:16

vf55up|yojc6f|yojc6f|2|I don't normally peddle stocks in here, but SAVA just released a 10Q. Phase 3 enrollment is moving along well, and they are releasing the results of their open label study "approximately year end," so there's a decent chance of another spike in the fairly short term. Coupled with the close of SEC investigation, the lawsuit they filed against short sellers and a string of insider buys the last couple months, I'd say the outlook is positive.

vewkwz|yojc6f|yojc6f|2|Most "articles" if you can call the slurry of 4 half backed paragraphs that are written by bots.   Wonder why CNBC publishes.teo exact opposite takes at the same time? Bots.   Wonder why that after one site published something with 10 minutes every site has a variant of that story but they all link to eat other? Bots.   That's the business model now, no one is interested in waiting for well researched and reported news. People want something directly related to w/e possible thing is on their mind accurate or not and the only way to farm that out is bots. The talking heads have the same problem, and have had to become increasingly regarded to stay interesting against instant information.  But I think we are at the next stage now as well.  Over the last few months I've seen articles and just gone holy fuck? Who was this written for? And I think the answer is we are now at the stage that bots are just writing articles for other bots.  A recent example of mind. On Thursday there were some sudden spikes in Tesla and activity in the 0DTE out prices. Resulted in 0.7% spike, whole thing was done in 5 minutes. At the same time that spike started yahoo finance and then everyone and their mom published a story about how humanoid robots could be 150B annual business and Tesla was going to be the leader in it per GS. And these articles were literally just smashed together key phrases, which to me read like a dictionary just puked on paper, but to s not would read "Tesla to lead humanoid robots", "Tesa renewed interest in humanoid robots","150B annual revenue, the same size of the EV market with Tesla""Goldman Sachs analysts suggest Tesla..."   Yeah anyway created some nice liquidity on an otherwise boring day, right before dumping the next day.  My theory is the bots are just shifting out articles for other bots now.|2022-11-07 07:54:26

Proportional to the player pool, it really stands out how hard it is for a Black NFL player to get an endorsement deal, particularly one who's still playing.

Like if you were *guaranteed* that one of the other things would happen before the stock market bottomed, you could just keep shorting the market and making the big bucks all the way down... but if it were that clear cut, everyone would do it which is impossible because the market is a zero sum game. Thus it is impossible to know which one of the above events comes first.  Also this year there have been so many proclamations like "X has never happened before Y" or "the last time Z happened was 500 years ago". But the past seems to be a pretty poor guide because as soon as a past correlation is observed, the reasonably efficient market renders it no longer actionable.|2022-11-07 11:59:39

vfqvcy|yojc6f|yojc6f|-7|It’s obnoxious as hell how many times this sub posts as if it’s a given that a dramatic 1930’s level depression is on the horizon.        Firstly, if anyone ever assumes anything is a given don’t listen to them because they are fucking r\*tarded. Nothing in life, especially in economics, is a given. Best you can realistically hope for is to be like 60% accurate in your predictions.        Secondly, there has been autistic screaming about an incoming depression for months now without any actual substantial evidence to back this up. Circumstantial perhaps, but nothing even remotely close to a smoking gun. Over-built tech companies that were boosted on speculation cutting employees is not a “sign of recession” because those companies were always evaluated on speculation and it’s quickly becoming apparent that Musk and Zuck (and others) are not the Tesla’s of the 21st century but the Edison’s, which is to say they are business people prone to stupid decisions and their companies were priced assuming they were perfect geniuses.        Thirdly, this sub is rife with right wing bias that assumes a man with a life long speech epidemic has dementia and that must mean we are headed to a depression. No, dipshit, none of that is true. Democrats are not somehow inherently bad at the economy. Read some economic history instead of watching Fox News all day and maybe you won’t blow all of your accounts on r\*tard stocks.

vek6p3|yojc6f|yojc6f|-2|Shorting at 380 today and double down at 382, if we break passed that its fucked, gonna buy friday puts I think. Small position at 380 because you never f00kin know now a days but I feel pretty confident we wont bust 382. It basically skipped instantly to 382 after breaking 380 so there could be a nice gap to fill around there before either going up or down. Obviously I think down, but yeah. Being patient and shorting 380-382 friday puts. If we don't get there we don't get there. Calls 370.|2022-11-07 06:00:28

SPY @ 370, user places banbet SPY 375.  (Delta = 5) 2. SPY drops to 365, (Delta has doubled now @10) 3. User doubles down and now the user can earn 2 wins or 2 losses and is banned for 2 weeks  Thoughts?|2022-11-07 07:37:54
