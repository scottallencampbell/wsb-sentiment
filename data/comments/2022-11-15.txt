wghicy|yvtvqv|yvtvqv|5|Man the automatic trading and interlinking in the market is crazy.     Walmart beat pretty low expectations and went from a profit to loss same quarter last year.  I think they did well all said, I think their ER probably earned a stock rise since they showed fantastic cost control, they cleared inventory, etc.   But what they said about the economic health of consumers was not good. They got a surprise increase from grocery sales as people mark down their spending. Why higher end stores pop off this is a mystery because this is their customers.   Why the market as a whole likes people being poorer and Walmart going from net profit to net loss in one year is a little strange.  Like why does 🌽 care? Walmart being a good company doesn't fix or related to crypto issues.  Why does COIN pump? Non of this news will stop them from losing another 700m.  Is this just markers trying to proxy everything to what the fed will do?|2022-11-15 07:48:41

That’s an increase of 8.3% from a year earlier, the most since a 9.1% jump in the first quarter of 2008. The debt figures aren’t adjusted for inflation.  -Bloomberg|2022-11-15 11:44:06

whni0m|yvtvqv|yvtvqv|2|COIN above $50 makes me angry.   Current positions? None.   But I find myself internally screaming "who the fuck is buying this forward cash flow projections have gotten worse every week for 8 fucking weeks".   From their investor letter Q3, future outlook on their hopefully forward projections.  "This assumes that crypto market capitalization and volatility do not deteriorate meaningfully below October levels and that we do not see changes in customer behaviors"  Since then 20% price decline in capitalization and the FTX collapse.   Anyway looking at their financials, and adjusting their forward projections against how previous impairment and declines impacted their revenue.  Total trading revenue Q3 to Q4? 366M to 275M. And I'm being generous there that they see almost no user decline or activity changes just hit by price.  Subscription services Q3 to Q4?  I'll assume interest hold parity. 210.5M to 160M.   Which brings net revenue from Q3 to Q4 as 576.4M to 435M. Another 25% Q/Q reduction, and I think I'm being pretty generous on assumptions. If the macro environment is worse (it is) from Q2 to Q3 where prices were at least stable they saw a 44% decline in revenue.  Likely users down again, people that just got butt fucked by overseas exchanges aren't exactly liquid to come to Coinbase.   I think they actually have done a good job on operating expenses but with out another major headcount reduction they will be looking at 1000M at best.   Throw in now a 20% impairment on crypto assets and at least 15M direct loss on FTX, and continued F/X write downs we are looking at another 150M.  This all puts Q4 at a 715M loss.   Anyway. Reeeeeeeeeeee. I could give no fucks on what the rest of the market does, may your tiddycoin or meme stock moon to infinity. But please market make this make sense, I want to be a bull again so bad but I can't when you are this regarded.|2022-11-15 12:36:03
