yyz8bx|nhoua8|nhoua8|9|Vancouver housing market tops list of most unaffordable in North America.   Great news! The landlord my wife and I rent from decided to sell so we’ve got to be out in July! Said I’d put an offer in. Listed for $430k (2 bed 2 bath condo). Sold for $500k, no subjects. 2 days on the market. We live in the greater Vancouver area, not even downtown. Got blown out of the water.   Of course I could not offer any higher as my portfolio is down about 25% and no news or positive earning release seems to make anything pop these days. So fuck me. The first time home buyer incentive for up to $35k doesn’t do fuck all when you can’t access it in time to pay the deposit.   Keep it coming!|2021-05-21 13:25:18

yyk2c6|nhoua8|nhoua8|20|Alright guys I quit, the days of tech are now over. Sell your computers and other devices so we can harvest the precious metals from them. You need to get Damascus steel blades because you'll need to scrape your gold shavings at the counter of Walmart to pay for your goods. Start buying Kerosene and learn how to write letters. Morse code would be a good skill and maybe figure out horse riding to maintain our postal service. Technology was just a fad all along.

yxgslc|nhoua8|nhoua8|14|Futures are moving higher this morning, with the Dow and S&P up about 0.4%. Nasdaq is 0.2% higher. This follows a rebound yesterday when tech booked major gains (Nasdaq rallied 1.8% and is now on track to break a four-week losing streak).  Another post-pandemic low in initial jobless claims yesterday does appear to have helped. Goes to show that just when you don’t see any catalysts for a rally, investors come in and bid things up. This tends to happen in bull markets. We’re still in a bull market. Probably will be for a little while.  Today we have purchasing manager surveys out at 0945. . That’s it for economic data releases. No major earnings reports either. May be a quiet day. May see more buying, as tends to happen in bull markets. Oh wait, I already said that.   Anyway, have a great weekend.|2021-05-21 05:46:49

yxkxjq|nhoua8|nhoua8|19|Get rid of the scarcity and limiting mindset. There is so much out there and more getting creating by the minute. Concentrate on growing your wealth.  There isn’t any hard set rules. Average down, but also average up. Sell for gains, but also sell for losses. Make the best decisions possible with the information you have that day with the overriding question being what will be the best return for me personally from this day forward.  The table is huge and so much food out there. So much that there is room for all of us to have a seat and feast.  Stay positive and don’t let the negative people suck the life force out of you.  Good luck.  ✌️|2021-05-21 06:39:36

SNOW = TDC competitor, losing money, has no sights to profitability, less revenue, less efficient than PLTR/TDC = ~$68B marketcap.

yxofdg|nhoua8|nhoua8|6|I stole this post but I can't remember who I stole it from.  Anywho, enjoy.  Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:  Stocks only go up   *This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.  I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.  I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. "What am I-"   "Why did you short the domestic market?" he asks.  "Huh?" I respond, confused.  "Why did you short the domestic market?" he demands, louder this time.  "I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.  "It's priced in," he says coolly. "So why did you short the domestic market?"  Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. "Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.  "Repeat after me: stocks only go up," Powell demands.  I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.  Powell frowns and continues, "I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?"  I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, "GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.  "Stocks only go up," Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.  The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.  "Stocks only go up," I say.|2021-05-21 07:17:35

The availability of the "commerical" model will likely be late 2022. It will be insanely disappointing, and it will become more and more evident that the entire Lightning presentation was solely to try to retain shareholder confidence. Ford will be lucky to produce and sell more than 20k Lightnings next year. They will perform poorly. The EV hype for Ford will fade. Ford will drown in crippling debt.  You heard it here first.  !RemindMe 1 year  E: best case scenario, Ford cannibalizes it's F150 ICE sales with the Lightning that they sell for thin margins or even a loss.

I saw a segment on 60 minutes about this company and something inside me said buy it.  Couldn’t find it...wasn’t even trading yet.  Looked for years and kind of forgot about it.  Then I remembered it...found out it was up and bought...kept buying making huge gains.  Everyone should look into this company. Watch the YouTube 60 minutes report on this company it is intriguing and It’s day coming.  I am no expert on trading and give no advice.  Do your homework on this one and tell me what you all think.

"... according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 129% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 114% annual growth over the past year.
