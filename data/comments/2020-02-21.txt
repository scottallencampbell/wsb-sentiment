iarxey|f79ki8|f79ki8|22|On ALLY... The market is clearly overreacting to their recent acquisition. They're riding the market waves and increasing their customer base, yes. But they have $180 billion in assets and literally spent $2.6 billion purchasing the company... so basically 1% of their assets and the company they purchased (CardWorks) has over $1 billion in revenue annually. Furthermore the purchase was half cash half stock deal. So they diluted their ownership slightly to make the acquisition.  And due to average household income remaining stagnant, with rising living costs, credit is used widely by consumers.  The infrastructure from the purchase will allow them to integrate the systems to drastically increase their credit card offerings to many more customers and also have more control over the terms they set. Their current credit card offerings are tailored to more credit worthy consumers but previously had been through a third party supplier.  Sure, they take on more mid term risk cuz we are due for a marketwide adjustment that will have huge consequences across all verticals... but since credit usage is in tune with other major market factors, and at an all time high right now, short term it will lead to more revenue with the ability to ride out future market forces and be positioned if and when the market corrects to have offerings tailored to the needs of the additional added subprime consumers.  In short, I think its drop is a huge overreaction. Ally's stability is good enough to ride out any recession due to the fact that they are primarily an online bank with extremely solid financials.  I am betting it will return to its predrop price within the next month. $33c 3/20|2020-02-21 11:46:56

Double down is a losing strategy, double up is a winning one as per experienced traders' views.   &#x200B;  A lot of people on TWTR who are veterans of trading they see this situation getting out of control and the shifts of the yield curves, reduced QE and Coronavirus global outlook is scaring everyone.   &#x200B;  Lets just wait until monday to see if we are good or not, we can potentially save us troubles rather than digging ourselves in even bigger hole.   &#x200B;  I understand FOMO is a gay but losing extra hurts way more than fomo.  &#x200B;  Also think if Monday we are red all the fucking retail mofo they will start fireselling their positions and amplify the move.|2020-02-21 12:18:53

I have a retarded nvidia $330c 2/28 from when it was shooting up that I converted into a calendar to make some money back. Short side expires today at max profit. Would it be retarded to open another short side for the same date as the long to try to make a little more money back in the meantime and then manually close the short side before the 28th if NVDA starts to turn around? I would just sell the long but I'm already at 84% loss and I would rather just hold to see if I can make some of this back. Any advice would be really appreciated|2020-02-21 12:51:11

iacp1t|f79ki8|f79ki8|2|For any of you long bulls out there, I still believe anything in $ATVI in the month of May is a good call. That 5 year chart is tasty to me. And that big drop was because of a shitty mobile game that had autists mad. I think $ATVI is going to keep heading up overall because I’m a 👩🏽‍💻gamer🎮 and no matter how shitty activision’s products are, I still buy them and their fucking micro transactions. 🐂➡️🐑 rise⤴️|2020-02-21 09:17:53
iacpay|f79ki8|f79ki8|2|So a few weeks ago I did something weird and diversified a little. Bought some TMF to go with my TQQQ. It's working to keep my losses in check, despite me increasing my TQQQ position in the last couple of days.  I also opened a similar 3 contract futures play of /ES, /ZT, and a gold position with /GC. I picked up the gold as an inflation hedge but those gold futures are really printing for me. I think I'll shift out of TMF/TQQQ into this /ES + /ZT + /GC 'portfolio', with the remaining cash split between MINT to cover any margin needs and a CEF like PDI. It's performing nicely. Can also be replicated with microfutures for smaller accounts.  Here's an example small account ($50k) where I'm doing this: https://i.imgur.com/UEn9NIf.png  Here's a bigger account ($500k) where I'm still playing with the microfutures but probably went too hard on TQQQ. You can see how well TMF is protecting me though: https://i.imgur.com/WEWt3v4.png   And another smaller ($30k) account where I'm purely using microfutures: https://i.imgur.com/XQ18e8p.png|2020-02-21 09:17:58

iazvap|f79ki8|f79ki8|2|Okay, if you are honestly going to buy calls in this type of market think about which companies have little to no china exposure. Or, you can be buying puts on the market overall which is safe. Personally: My BBBY APR $15C are looking pretty ugly right now and put volume has increased on the stonk.  That said: CME APR and MAR 222.5C are actually green! Why? Increased volatility means more people trading = more money for CME group. This is how you need to think in this type of market. Is chipotle going to be hurt by China not shopping? Probably not because they have no exposure. Buy things that people are panic selling that have zero china exposure!|2020-02-21 13:02:13

Jpow, the Fed, not QE,  The late stage business cycle of greed and euphoria that they’re keeping going is allowing kids with bar mitzvah money to make 6 figs. Of course the public will follow that. 40% chance of major correction or depression in 6 months. 80% in next year. The blood will run soon, SQQQ calls, SPY puts until then. Day of reckoning is near.

iaimlc|f79ki8|f79ki8|1|"In the latest Observer, Dave brings up that talks have been happening between WWE and ESPN. No deal is in place that he can confirm at the moment.  While there has been no deal that we’ve been able to confirm, in a story that is logical, there have been talks between ESPN and WWE. These talks would be regarding WWE content on ESPN+. It is likely the deal WWE is trying to broker, which is a similar deal to UFC where they would sell the rights to their PPVs to a new streaming service that would pay more than WWE could make on its own from selling the content direct to consumers through the WWE Network."  Thinking back, I think Dave was talking about the Raw and Smackdown deals being huge before the word went out on Wall St and the stock started soaring. Obviously this isn't the same type of impact but still would lead to more money for WWE|2020-02-21 10:16:50

iak8ef|f79ki8|f79ki8|1|New to options... looking for advice.   I've been playing Calls on $PCG.  I live here in CA, I think the calls for public takeover are a bunch of bullshit, and won't happen.  Obviously a BLUE state, and the PCG Union is calling for no public takeover, so politicians will have to deal with fallout from a battle with a union, which I'm sure they don't want.   My strategy has just been to buy a call, watch it rise 20% or more, and then sell.  Not sure if that is a good way to go...   If your calls are up 50%, do you just sell, and then rebuy a position a little farther out or with a slightly higher strike price?  Are there any guidelines that will be helpful for me?   Any advice is appreciated.|2020-02-21 10:32:43
