But when you're alone in the casino trying to play the bank, you get fucked by their cameras every time.  There's too much money on the side, too little volume at the table. The bank can play it any way. This flat shit will continue for another few months, even if retail completely capitulates. Only real pain to the casino can force their hands. FED stop doing pussy hikes, some companies going bust, mass layoffs, some delta desks closed.  Until then, they can keep playing each other, passing around there chips.  At the end, it's the FED and the SEC fucking up. Don't hate the player, but the game. I better go and find some otc game to satisfy my gambling addiction.|2022-07-15 13:36:14

They've only got one flashlight, which is necessary to cross, and the bridge an only support the weight of 2 soldiers at most crossing at the same time. The soldiers are in various states of health, affecting the speed of their ability to cross, and if a group of two soldiers is crossing they can only go at the slower soldier's speed.  Got a healthy guy who can cross in 1 minute  Minor injured guy who can cross in 2 minutes  Moderately injured dude crossing in 5 min  And heavily injured dude who takes 10 min to bring across  Russian orcs are advancing and will get to the bridge in 17 min, so they've all got to be on the other side by then.

gaxo3w|vzkwb1|vzkwb1|3|One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned this year was that inflation is bad for the stock market because it hurts the consumer. My impression 6 months back was that stocks would go up in an inflationary because companies can simply raise prices accordingly, but this isn’t necessarily true because wages rarely keep up with inflation and a weak consumer will lead to an unhealthy economy. If wages kept in exact lockstep then the economy would be relatively unaffected and my original thesis would be correct but in the real world it never works out that way.   However, we are seeing one of the greenest days in recent history today because according to todays report, consumer spending has not slowed down despite inflation. This counters the entire thesis that has smashed the stock market for the last 7 months now and backs up my original thought process. So I lost my 150k for fucking nothing. That pisses me off. I’m gonna go get drunk now.!|2022-07-15 14:34:53

g93few|vzkwb1|vzkwb1|2|The ECB comes out with their anti fragmentation tool - what is it, you ask? It’s Hank Paulson’s QE bazooka!  They’re promising to buy an unlimited amount of bonds as needed to defend the BTP-Bund spread.  This should go well. I’m now planning out a European vacation for the fall, €0.25-$1 is gonna be sweet.  ETA: I’m sorry this is WSBs alot of y’all need that interpreted.   Italian bonds have way higher interest rates than German bonds (Italy is much poorer) raising rates is gonna make that worse. Euro central bank needs too though, cause inflation. But if they spin completely out of control, Italy will have another sovereign debt crisis potentially destroying the Euro itself with contagion. So their solution is what the Treasury Secretary came up with back in 08 - bluffing he had unlimited funds to stop the bleeding and hoping he wouldn’t get challenged on that. (He did). The ECB is hoping that they won’t get challenged (they will). So they’re gonna have to actively make the money printer go brrr while raising rates at the same time in the midst of an energy crisis so bad that Germany may end up fucked so bad they’ll be invading Russia again.

The 76-year-old Errol Musk also said that he felt that the only reason for being on Earth is to reproduce.  The US Sun paper said that Errol said he had a child with his 35-year-old stepdaughter Jana Bezuidenhout three years ago. Errol and Bezuidenhout had a baby girl named Elliot Rush, nicknamed Rushi, in 2018 and the duo had lived together for a while, he told the paper.  Errol Musk, an engineer turned businessman, was married to Jana’s mother Heide for nearly two decades and had two biological children with her, said the report.  Errol said that while he has not checked the DNA of the child, “it’s pretty obvious” that she is his child because she looks exactly like his two other daughters Rose and Tosca."|2022-07-15 12:57:22

The 76-year-old Errol Musk also said that he felt that the only reason for being on Earth is to reproduce.  The US Sun paper said that Errol said he had a child with his 35-year-old stepdaughter Jana Bezuidenhout three years ago. Errol and Bezuidenhout had a baby girl named Elliot Rush, nicknamed Rushi, in 2018 and the duo had lived together for a while, he told the paper.  Errol Musk, an engineer turned businessman, was married to Jana’s mother Heide for nearly two decades and had two biological children with her, said the report.  Errol said that while he has not checked the DNA of the child, “it’s pretty obvious” that she is his child because she looks exactly like his two other daughters Rose and Tosca."|2022-07-15 12:58:12

g9rucm|vzkwb1|vzkwb1|-2|The market spoke loudly in the low 370s for SPY. It collectively decided that was going to be the bottom. Too many nest eggs at risk. The market also sees inflation having peaked and is expecting a big downswing in next month’s data.  The market reads Jerome’s mind.   The market can see the grimace easing from Jerome’s face and the faint signs of a smile returning The recognition that he can get back to his true calling, after having had to deal with a few months of inconvenience from the poors crying about how gas and rent is crushing them.   The time is coming very soon where he can, once again, throttle that beautiful money printer to full speed ahead. Feel that deep, guttural roar. Hear the whoosh of the financial and real asset markets zipping back up to dizzying heights. Protecting the home equity values and asset portfolios of the upper middle class and high net worth.   Yes, Jerome knows he can soon get back to what he does best.|2022-07-15 09:57:45

gaam9z|vzkwb1|vzkwb1|-2|how to get anyone on wall street bets to believe in something. Be an expert in your field, spend a lifetime perfecting your craft, and then say the opposite of what you want people to think. They will "inverse you" because everything on earth is apparently a conspiracy. If you want people to believe in a recession when there isnt one? say there is one. Want people to believe in a crash when there isnt one? say it's coming in 5 months and they'll think it's tomorrow.|2022-07-15 12:01:30
gac8vg|vzkwb1|vzkwb1|-3|$REV Decent buy point here. Based on a Cash Flow model at 4.1x (industry standard is 5-8x) we have an enterprise value at $18 Fair Value. Add in margin and we get a likely buyout price around $14-$16. Factor in probability of buyout offer at 75%, we see this stock headed to at least $11. The upside of the model indicates about a 15% chance of receiving full value of $29 per share on current supply demand.  $REV We also believe that the bond market reflects incorrect asset pricing. It is currently assumed by the bond market that this company is unable to receive future financing. Based on brand pricing power and goodwill in brand name products, we believe that this assumption is incorrect and Revlon will receive access to additional funding. Considering markets also currently price peak fed funds rates upwards of 4%, we think that this is also incorrect and stocks like Revlon which have a high debt-equity ratio are being over-sold and will correct. This brings 2 correction potentials to the stock. 1 where fed-funds rate based default probabilities decrease substantially, and 1 where defaulting is off the table based on access to additional funding. The second point was validated in a SEC filing on 07/09 when the company received over 260 million in capital for restructuring.  When debt default is taken off the table, we calculate a fair transaction at $1 -$29 based on financing breadth.  Edit: $11-$29|2022-07-15 12:12:12
