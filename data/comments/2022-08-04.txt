ix26hd|wfx7qh|wfx7qh|35|So let me get this straight. You’re supposed to:  Buy the dip, but don’t catch a falling knife  Don’t fight the fed, but also don’t fight the trend  Keep an eye on bonds, if they rally it means relative valuation gets lower and you should be bullish on stocks, but also watch out for a bond rally because it’s indicative of a flight for safety which means you should be bearish on stocks  Pay attention to max pain, since MMM will manipulate the market lower or higher to revert to that target. But also watch out for a face ripping drill/rally, since it will create a gamma squeeze that will force MMM to keep feeding it.   Keep an eye out for bad economic data, since it means the fed will pivot. Also keep an eye out for good economic data, which is also bullish.   Did I miss anything?|2022-08-04 09:10:54

If you charged more for swallowing ($30 a dick) and could swallow about 12 loads a day, and suck an additional 16 dicks to lower your overall dick intake by 6 dicks a day, and while I've never sucked a dick I am pretty sure 6 less dicks a day would be worth the dozen loads, which would actually negate the need for packing a lunch and save you more money there too.|2022-08-04 12:01:08

iy4k3l|wfx7qh|wfx7qh|3|Your daily reminder:  **What the London Whale did.**  JP Morgan was using the FDIC-insured deposits of Chase customers, and gambling with those deposits when the London Whale made some really bad trades that ended up losing $13 Billion.   The reason this was so heinous and illegal is because the **US Taxpayer** was on the hook for repaying the Chase customers (FDIC!) who lost all that money.    So, JP Morgan had found a way to gamble with public money, and they really fucked it up badly.   === ====  They were probably fined about 28 million for doing that bad bad thing, I don't remember.  And Jamie Dimon still has a job, what does that tell you.|2022-08-04 13:16:01

We have all these bad habits and silly axioms based off a fake market, and then when the market starts behaving rationally again due to the bad actors having to pull back as a result of inflation, everyone is going to act super confused like, "wait, what do you mean bad economic data isn't good for the stock market, i thought all htat mattered was how close daddy P is to pivoting on my face".

ix9vq9|wfx7qh|wfx7qh|0| “The three-decade era of globalisation risks going into reverse according to company executives and investors, as world leaders prepare to meet in the Swiss town of Davos for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began.  The geopolitical fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine, combined with the disruption to global supply chains caused by the virus, recent market turmoil and the rapidly worsening economic outlook leave corporate leaders and investors grappling with vital strategic decisions, several told the Financial Times in interviews.  “Tension between the US and China was accelerated by the pandemic and now this invasion of Ukraine by Russia — all these trends are raising serious concerns about a decoupling world,” said José Manuel Barroso, chair of Goldman Sachs International and a former president of the European Commission.  Onshoring, renationalisation and regionalisation had become the latest trends for companies, slowing the pace of globalisation, he added: “[Globalisation faces] friction from nationalism, protectionism, nativism, chauvinism if you wish, or even sometimes xenophobia, and for me, it is not clear who is going to win.”  “Pretty much no one has seen” these conditions “during the arc of their investing career”, according to the head of one of the world’s largest private equity groups. Charles ‘Chip’ Kaye, chief executive of Warburg Pincus, said geopolitics had been “on the fringe of the way we thought” since the fall of the Berlin Wall and that this had “provided a certain oxygen to global growth”.  However, he said, geopolitics was now “front and centre” of investment decisions just as the “pretty powerful tailwind to asset prices” provided by years of falling inflation and low interest rates comes to an end.“You’re not optimising the economic outcome, you’re creating friction in the system,” he said of rising geopolitical tensions.  Talk about deglobalisation among companies has mounted in recent weeks. Mentions of nearshoring, onshoring and reshoring on corporate earning calls and investor conferences are at their highest level since at least 2005, according to data provider Sentieo.  The subject will be high on the agenda for attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. Since its last meeting in January 2020 world events have scrambled the supply chains that underpin the globalisation that the WEF champions.  “Companies are saying I need my production closer to my customers,” said Jonathan Gray, president of Blackstone Group.The head of Asia’s largest pharmaceutical company said the era of globalisation based on outsourcing functions to cut costs was over.  Christophe Weber, chief executive of Takeda, which is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, said drugmakers would continue to seek growth in international markets, particularly China because of its high potential. But corporate focus had shifted to a more sustainable form of globalisation, he said: “It’s a question of de-risking your supply chain.”  “It would be a short-cut to say that globalisation is over but the globalisation that people have in mind is not true any more,” Weber said. “The globalisation which existed a few years ago, trade without constraints, and the ‘world is flat’ idea, is finished.”   Takeda has implemented a dual sourcing policy to build more redundancy into its supply chains, Weber added: “I never thought [outsourcing] would work long-term but I think this is clear for everyone now.  ”Consumer industries are also experiencing a shift away from globalisation, according to Rachid Mohamed Rachid, chair of Valentino and Balmain.Some luxury companies are rethinking their strategy, which tended to rely heavily on global branding, selling to tourists and shipping goods around the world, he said: “The business has gone local . . . Stores today in London or Paris or Milan are now catering for their local residents more than they used to before.  ”In the past two years companies have begun to “look local and start acting locally instead of acting globally”, he told the FT’s Business of Luxury conference earlier this week. “In different markets like the US, Europe, Asia, even smaller markets like Latin America and Africa, people are looking locally now and I’m sure there’ll be a lot of local deals taking place.”  https://www.ft.com/content/0599878e-a820-4657-8e52-f069bb10d512  TL;DR   # NO MORE CHEAP CHINESE GOODS|2022-08-04 10:02:30
