5ya1bz|dplxm8|dplxm8|15|Hello everyone and welcome back to **Magical Crayons TA.**  Today's trading did not go as [predicted yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpcu87/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_october_31/f5uc0ef/) In spite of the rate cut, good earnings from major companies like AAPL and FB and SBUX, the market instead decided to dip. Ostensibly it was because of Gyna trade deal news and Chicago PMI bombing, but of course who knows for certain.   We have fallen back into trends that happened prior to rate cut announcement. I have accompanying magical crayons here showing this, [with the white circle being the FOMC announcement where we breached into hopium range and the white lines being the way we were trending prior and today's action back into normal bullishness.](https://imgur.com/yd95YLV)  What happens now? It's difficult to say for certain. We are now back in a lower tier of bullish trading, but make no mistake we're still bullish. For bears, you again can see from [the orange magical crayons posted above](https://imgur.com/yd95YLV) the multiple resistances we have to cross to have sufficient sell signals to come out of hibernation. For bulls, today's small pullback is better for a longer-term bull market-- you would actually prefer flat trading at these ranges for today and Monday, as we were in a rising wedge pattern to about November 7th.   We'll have economic news tomorrow as many of you know and we should expect it to be neutral to bad. If the market doesn't respond strongly and continues flat trading, it bodes well for slightly longer dated calls that are OTM. If it rises quickly on bad news, it would be best to sell at 304 to lock in profits because anything past that breaks back into hopium range, which couldn't be sustained in spite of neutral/good news yesterday. For bears you're looking for the collapse of the 300.8 resistance to start entering with confidence.  See you all tomorrow and bless your portfolios.

5yh2n5|dplxm8|dplxm8|5|I've got the TA on GDXJ (Junior gold miners) but the same logic can be applied to /GC futures and GLD as a whole because they trade together.  Lets get into it:  Recently, we received the FOMC news that the FED cut rates three times in a row. The dollar, soon after, tanked and gold has a fresh breath of air. It has a reason to rally - global banks all over the world are cutting rates in lieu of facing a recession. They want to do QE? That's fine with me, gold will continue to breakout as long as the government deflates the dollar and safe havens like precious metals and bonds keep getting bought up.  So, from a macro perspective, gold has plenty of reasons to run. It has hit all-time-highs in EVERY major currency except for the USD.   As debt increases, gold becomes substantially more attractive. https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Global-Debt.png  The global flat currencies will keep declining...gold will keep rising.  http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2019_ft/JUL-DEC/global-central-banks-have-been-net-buyers-of-gold-since-2010-05212019-LG.png  Gold is being bought up by central bankers, more so than any other entity.

5y5jqp|dplxm8|dplxm8|-6|SPY 304 End of week.  Today's dip results from:  1. Bloomberg's FAKE NEWS on trade talk, again. Chinese state owned media literally said trade talk going well today.  2. Congress impeachment drama which won't go anywhere.|2019-10-31 14:45:34

5xdglq|dplxm8|dplxm8|-12|‚ÄúBootleg flair:  üí£ Dead Money üí£‚Äù  Panic sold my 11/1 34.50 AMD Calls for .10. Saw SPY recovering and lost charts when ToS went down. Couldn‚Äôt see chart and thought I was fucked.   Messaged TOS support and they were like sorry for your loss. We restarted the servers. Ending chat. At least when you bitch to Robinhood they send you an Amazon gift card. TOS can lick my balls.  *edit- I don‚Äôt understand all the downvotes. Are you corporate carpet munchers really okay with Ameritrade not being able to keep their servers up during market hours?  I‚Äôve paid about $7500 in commissions this year. For $7500 a year I would expect to have working servers. Or just keep being ball washers and downvote me into oblivion in defense of ToS.|2019-10-31 11:26:37
