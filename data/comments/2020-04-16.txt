nl7cbo|g2c9fj|g2c9fj|31|I have interesting findings to share with this autistic community.     I've been running a test.  In one account, I trade triple leveraged ETF's, just straight shares-SPXU and UPRO.  In another, I buy options on SPY.  Both accounts have the same directional bias at any given point in time-SPXU shares/SPY puts, UPRO shares/SPY calls.       I use limit buys and trailing stops to get out of the ETFs.  I use limit orders on options, no stops.  The option expirations are usually within a week, and the trades in/out within 0-1 days.     Gain/Loss ratio trading 3x ETF's - 28 closing trades in the last 30 days, 89% of them profitable.  Net gain - 18k.  Starting account size - 57k, end value, \~75k     Gain/loss ratio trading options - 35 closing trades in the last 30 days, 23% of them profitable.  Net loss - 15k.  Starting account size 27k.

Do we just live a world where stocks are near ATH with 25% unemployment and horrific ERs quarter after quarter? Does the fed take a 70% equity stake in every company? 🤔|2020-04-16 14:14:43

nldmmv|g2c9fj|g2c9fj|6|$80 on HYG is the important level to watch.  It has touched that mark 3 or 4 times this week and bounced right off and then the market moons (The correlation with SPY is around .95)  Why is that? Because the fed jumps in and buys it when it goes under NAV which is around $80. But they can't keep buying it indefinitely, they have to stop when the fed's ownership of the ETF reaches 20%.  If someone smarter than me could figure out when the fed has to stop buying, I think they would have a good lead on when the next leg down begins.  But maybe I'm way off and none of this matters.|2020-04-16 10:41:38

nlzlq4|g2c9fj|g2c9fj|9|May 1st is the day that market will crash.Property taxes are paid on a quarterly basis, so next one is due on May 1st.   With the amount of mortgage forbearance and no one paying rent, these homeowners and realtors are gonna have to pony up a big amount of money or ask for another kind of bailout.  &#x200B;  If you haven't been following, there's a very big mortgage bubble that is happening where the mortgage servicers and investors strapped for cash since they own/owe bond coupons, which is literally hundreds of millions of dollars, that may not be able to get paid since no revenue is coming in. Banks are already making it harder to borrow money, but they'll probably be able to pony up the money; but all the non-bank servicers are gonna get whacked with a big bill with no revenue coming in.  &#x200B;  This is happening the same time that SBA runs out of PPP loans, so small businesses are gonna get jacked to the titz.  This is happening the same time that unemployment keeps spiking up, and probably not being processed efficiently so that's an underestimate, and several anecdotal reports that people aren't even getting paid their UI checks (nor their $600 extra).|2020-04-16 13:41:40

In addition to a lack of new aircraft, airlines are going to phase out their high capacity aircraft such as the A380 or 747.   This creates a situation where airlines are going to look to go small and the only two real options are Bombardier and Embraer. Bombardier is in partnership with Airbus and Boeing is working on a partnership for an 80% stake of commercial Embraer aircraft.   Expect the anti-trust hurdles that Boeing and Embraer need to clear to become non-existent as both the Brazilian and US government want to keep two large hiring businesses operating as close to normal as possible. After the deal is closed, Boeing might even look to buyout ERJ as it continues its commercial conflict with Airbus.|2020-04-16 08:55:24

nlr1up|g2c9fj|g2c9fj|3|Hold the fuck on, WING is seriously right back near it's recent highs.   They released some preliminary Q1 data that seemingly shows they're doing well despite the virus, due in part to a promotion they've been running for free delivery:   >while we have seen a slight decline in overall transactions due to the loss of dine in, growth in our average ticket has surpassed these transaction declines as we're primarily serving meals for families. In fact, the first three weeks of period 3 (February 23, 2020 to March 14, 2020), domestic same-store sales growth was 8.5%, and since then (post COVID-19 escalation) we saw an acceleration in same-store sales growth. During the last two weeks of period 3 (March 15, 2020 to March 28, 2020), domestic same-store sales growth was 8.9%.    Still, this seems really optimistic... glancing through the company's finances...

nlka6d|g2c9fj|g2c9fj|3|NIH study abstract: "Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19. Unfortunately, these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content. Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation."    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32294574/|2020-04-16 11:36:33

I could of still sold twice for profits of 2k to 1k but BAGHELD cause I couldn’t believe it’ll keep goings  My put ended up expiring WORTHLESS, from 6k profit to only 2.6k, cause my other play I had sold beforehand.

nln6bx|g2c9fj|g2c9fj|8|This comment will go unnoticed, but I’ll say it anyway.  All you guys constantly chasing these wild swings, I have 2 pieces of advice...  1- If you’re aware of a crazy swing and want to make some bank, you’re already too late. Your broker is slower, and you’re playing into a pre-defined profit taking range from the big investors. By the time you buy, they are usually already out. Imagine driving a car where the steering is delayed by 1 second. It’s gonna crash even if you drive “perfectly”.  2- Be patient, find a company you like, buy some REASONABLE calls (can be way OTM if they justify) and just fucking wait it out man.   I can say this with confidence as I switched to this “tactic” a few weeks ago and IMMEDIATELY stopped losing money. Most tech stocks have done 30% in the past few weeks. Buy one you like with a 30% OTM call and just wait it the fuck out.  Trust me. You will be happier making 30% than losing 100%|2020-04-16 11:59:38

nkphz2|g2c9fj|g2c9fj|4|LMAO even FED itself is bearish on the economy.  Yesterday FED published the [Beige Book](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20200415.pdf). The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from District sources.  Here's the key highlights what FED is saying about economy:  >Many businesses expected heightened slack in the labor market going forward, eliminating any prior upward pressure on wage and price growth.  &#x200B;  >Many Districts said severe job cuts were widespread, including the manufacturing and energy sectors. Contacts in several Districts noted they were cutting employment via temporary layoffs and furloughs that they hoped to reverse once business activity resumes. The nearterm outlook was for more job cuts in coming month.  &#x200B;  >The general direction of price inflation was down for both selling prices and non-labor input prices, as Districts reported either slowing price growth, flat prices, or modest to moderate declines in prices on balance.

We're truly fucked health (25-30k official deaths -way more off the grid- with 10% of your population) economy wise and even though I trust the US government way more than mine I think you guys have no fucking idea what you're heading into, with the latest rally.  Let's say I'm willing to bet 5k that the economy is really going to shit long term, because I'm fucking certain. May not be tomorrow or next week, but 6 months from now you guys are going to be in a pretty bad shape.  How would you go about it? I'm a retard regarding the stock market, I just buy blue chips so help me out here.

Farther out $82.5c Jan 2021  And a more risky bet on $87.5c 6/19   SBUX is a $90-$100 stock and as soon as things clear up a bit more it's gonna head back that way.  Bad earnings may hold it up but only temporarily.  So if your personal risk tolerenace is low - go leaps in the high 80s.  If you are willing to make a big bet go summer calls in the 80s|2020-04-16 09:25:39

However, I only use like 3-5% of my portfolio so the 100% gains aren’t incredible, I know as soon as I use greater than 10% I will get so fucked.   But using SPY option profits and buying more less than 5 dollar shares. SPY puts are best cause 100% profits, my small cap loses value. I dump twice as much into shares.
