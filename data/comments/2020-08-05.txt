Noting that Call of Duty has made up 25% of the company's annual revenue on average over the last five years, Nowak said he sees the "sea-change in user base and engagement" potentially driving multiple quarters of higher earnings power.|2020-08-05 08:01:04

But if Stimulus fails to get done EOW and the Jobs data Thur-Friday is bad, we could correct a lot there I think.  Monday is probably a green recovery day if that happens as "Stimulus hopes" recycles ‚ôªÔ∏è one more week.  Only real catalyst for a "crash" is a black swan event or the outright failure of the bill passing to vote. It doesn't look like we will be getting more lockdowns or major bankruptcies anytime soon so if we get through Stimulus without a major tank we could be on our way past ATH.  There is when we might be at most risk. If we ride into October past ATH that could be trouble. Volume will kick back up and shit gets irrational in the spooky October- November months.|2020-08-05 13:02:27

0gs81v|i42orx|i42orx|8|So it seems that EVERYONE on the internet is 100% sure of these things:  * Bond rates will stay near zero  * People ‚Äúhave to‚Äù make a yield so they‚Äôll move out of bonds to buy stocks at any price regardless of the economy  * Stocks will keep mooning indefinitely   * A lot of money supply has been added but since people are conserving/saving money, inflation hasn‚Äôt hit. Once spending resumes inflation will shoot up.   * Then asset prices will shoot up even more (though only for currency reasons)  Which seems like a fine story. But if everyone REALLY agreed on this, stocks would be much much much higher than they are.   What‚Äôs keeping people from going all in yolo into equities right now?

One reason this stock hasn't mooned yet is because prudent investors were worried about the 10-q , and it was a big looming question how much the company had to pay to keep the lights on, pay off the $60mill debt + penalties, buy SmartPharm, and pay Columbia for the license .  TURNS OUT, NOT A WHOLE FUCKING LOT AT ALL.  The <10% dilution was priced in.  SRNE is now a $3 bill company with no debt that wants to make tens of millions of COVID tests + also has a few drugs that could change the world.  NBD.

0gqrke|i42orx|i42orx|2|>BigCommerce (BIGC) opened trading at $68 after the IPO was priced last night at $24 (up from the initial range of $18 to $20). Shares of BIGC have already run up to $91.80 as investors continue to latch on to all things digital. The company valuation at that price would be nearly $7.5B. An exchange trading halt has already been fired off on the stock.  I'm surprised people aren't spamming about this stonk all over the place today.|2020-08-05 12:13:31

0gyc5y|i42orx|i42orx|2|The chatter about deflation makes me wonder, what if big tech companies don't lower their prices. Like one of the reasons luxury goods sell is because of their high price implies high value. If sales slow down in this environment, the companies can blame it on coronavirus uncertainties and refuse to lower prices to compensate. As long as the administration continues to give out free cash, there is no reason for companies to lower their prices. Maybe bare necessities price will go down but luxury goods should not. I don't think deflation will happen because US appetite for goods is a bottomless pit. Just buy assets and watch them inflate.|2020-08-05 13:12:30

0gwuv7|i42orx|i42orx|5|So, in the last 48 hours, we have gotten the following covid news:  1. We've reached the other side of the curve in FL, TX, AZ, and probably CA; 2. T-cell memory is real and means a significant portion of the population can fight off the most severe covid; 3. Hospitalized covid patients treated with convalescent plasma may have their death rates reduced up to 50%; 4. NYC is experiencing nearly zero new cases or deaths.  These pieces of news will not be widely reported. Instead, on /r/Coronavirus, you will hear that vast death is right around the corner, as per the usual. You will hear schools must remain closed. You will hear that the Sun Belt blew it. You will hear lockdowns must be reimposed.  This is bullshit, pure and simple. It is not data-driven.

They  are literally so many they are getting sick of reviewing them.  Yet  some still think BYND can maintain its margins long term with so many  competitors? And many of the competitors (Kellogs, Tyson , + more ) have  much bigger budgets to spend on advertising, marketing and product  development. They lost 2c  ( in real terms 16c loss!) a share this  quarter and revenues were only up around 12% quarter on quarter. How is  this a company of the future?|2020-08-05 08:01:55

Really unfortunate shit considering that I‚Äôm at all time lows right now, and now it‚Äôs all gonna come crashing down before Friday so I can‚Äôt even buy calls to ride the wave at this point       Was gonna buy SPY $328c 8/5 at 3:50pm yesterday = +100% gain    Was gonna by SQ calls yesterday = +150% gain     Was gonna buy NCLH calls yesterday = +80%-120% gain     Was also gonna sell NCLH calls yesterday, which would have fucked me      Was gonna buy CHWY $50c calls at $48 last Friday = +200%        Was gonna buy SWBI calls last week for $25c 8/21, would have had +120% easy      But I hesitated on all these calls because I‚Äôve lost so much the last two weeks that I only have $322 to my name :‚Äô(      Edit: fuck you guys in the comments lmao you and I do not compare smfh|2020-08-05 07:14:38
