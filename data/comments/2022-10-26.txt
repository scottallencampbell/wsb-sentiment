Put aside the paramount importance of the casino; inflation entrenched in the economy long term would be a fucking nightmare to eradicate.

SPY can help pull your stock up or down; if SPY is under VWAP and the market is down I tend to avoid buying or buy at a low support levels and swing it to resistance; which is where those dumb ass lines come in handy.

You see what bets all the regards are making at any given time. You have super computers that can evaluate all that in a split second.  Now to the most important part. You can utilize that infinite 'money' to buy/sell any stock or etf you want. Doing so in high volume obviously will move the price of said stock or etf. Now imagine you can do this to ensure the bets being made at your casino daily are always more to the losing side.

I was thinking about how Apple sells phones either direct to the public or to retailers. They sell phones direct to public for cash and at 0% interest loans. This forces phone retailers to also sell phones on a 0% interest loan plan. Is there a chance that if interest rates stay high, they will have to start charging interest on new phones sold on loan, and this could possibly lower demand significantly? I also could see how it's a non issue, but phones are lasting longer today than ever before and largely new phones don't do anything the large majority of people can't do on their old phone.|2022-10-26 10:33:39tv7kav|ydu4sz|ydu4sz|1|ive had calls all day, but theres no way we pass through majors resistance at 388|2022-10-26 10:34:22tv7nfw|ydu4sz|ydu4sz|1|Bears gone to hibernate|2022-10-26 10:34:56tv90zi|ydu4sz|ydu4sz|1|QQQ still in the red while SPY shreketh like theres no tomorrow![img](emotet5_2th524275)  Get the fuck up into deep green QQQ you lil hoe![img](emotet5_2th524267)|2022-10-26 10:44:03tv9p3h|ydu4sz|ydu4sz|1|Bought this plant-based protein vanilla powder cuz it was half off in the local healthfood store.  there may have been a reason it's half off.  >!It's not 'bad' per se, but you know when you over-flavor a drink and it just is gross?!<|2022-10-26 10:48:29tv9z8e|ydu4sz|ydu4sz|1|big money still not buying options, i think there waiting for apple earnings which basically means if apple earnings are shit we can have recession 2.0|2022-10-26 10:50:20tva9uc|ydu4sz|ydu4sz|1|Invested into INTC since people are buying their gpus.
