For now market is contracting and expansion phase is not at sight.  **Please don't hold positions overnight and recommend to do intraday cause market is consolidating and is not showing signs of expansion**  #____________________   **Longterm** : Nasdaq 10k support is a very strong psychological support, usually when such strong support emerges taking long term trades gets comfortable, seeing spy 300 and Nasdaq 10k, it seems to have become a strong market with less of a downside, thus recommend to load quality stocks in SIP mode to benefit the volitality    #____________________   **Random tip for the day** : "intelligent people are people who learn from their own mistakes, wise people are those who learns from others mistakes"    #____________________  **Spy Pre-market**  (313.51) −0.27 (0.086%)   #____________________  Previous post of daily updates and insights :   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hmsv6v/7_july_2020_its_your_boy_chimpu_back_with_daily/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  #_____________________       #its your boy chimpu and will be back with more updates and insights|2020-07-08 05:33:03

xb3s47|hnegmj|hnegmj|15|# Market Predic_Ginn, July 8th  ## Events  * MBA Mortgage Application Index (7am) * EOA Crude Oil Inventories (10:30am) * Consumer Credit (3pm)  ## Notable Earnings  * Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY, after hours). A large retailer with a struggling presence even before covid. Look for the market to extrapolate the earnings to other retailers in similar positions. Any loss here will be shifted towards online giants (Amazon, Wayfair, Walmart, etc.).  ## News Yesterday (July 7th)  * Rumors of Walmart launching a service to compete with Amazon. $95 a year, free delivery, etc. * U.S. begins formal withdrawal out of World Health Organization (WHO) * Gold above $1,800, highest since 2011  # Bear Day Prediction  * Spy tilts towards 305. If deaths spike, and TX, FL, AZ, Las Vegas, or CA consider shutting down (to some extent), I believe we will see a similar sell off as today in travel sectors. I believe the inevitable realization that you have to slow down coronavirus is settling in. Coronavirus will not slow down on its own. * I believe a reality and market check will happen by the end of the week. This means a bloody day (6/4, 6% drop).  Earnings will be a pivotal stretch for the market. Considering April and May were some of the highest saving months on record, money was not moving and when money isn't moving revenue is dropping across the economy. The aftermath could be a steady -3 to -5% per week as earnings continue. Final support is 250 (+/-25), no way we dip below March.  # Bull Day Prediction  * Spy pushes towards 318 behind tech and cloud firms (F, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc.). There may be a flight to quality heading to earnings season, which will bolster SPY, DAQ, etc. R2000 and others may suffer. I believe the global response to Covid will ensure a stronger rebound in the supply chain, which we so often hear about. I believe part of the bounce early this week was in part to supply chain (China rockets up 5%, we follow suit). * I don't see spy escaping 320 this week. No one will be going out of their way to buy heavy before earnings. As mentioned above, earnings will be important. The market could realistically carry to 350 if earnings are not "that bad." If consumers shifted their demand to tech and away from entertainment, I believe we will just see a shift similar in the market (I believe we're already seeing it now. Fuck TSLA tho.)  # Kang Gang Prediction  * Everyone is too scared to do anything, volume remains low and prices remain flat. Go back to Australia you fucks. Spy 314 EoD and bouncing between 300-325 for 3 months with Jerome tugging us like fucking toddlers in a wagon away from scary bears.|2020-07-08 07:54:08

He writes: " The next day we got the news of the San Francisco earthquake. It was an awful disaster. But the market opened down only a couple of points. The bull forces were at work, and the public never is independently responsive to news. You see that all the time, certain news items fail to have the effect they would have if the Street was bearish. It is all in the state of sentiment at the time. In this case the Street did not appraise the extent of the catastrophe because it didn't wish to."|2020-07-08 10:31:21

xb5bml|hnegmj|hnegmj|11|The funniest thing about TSLA is that someday (not right now), it will return to the COVID low prices. When it does, hardly anyone will see it coming.

xatgx0|hnegmj|hnegmj|10|Some ideas for how to approach the day today.  On a flat day like today, day traders are going to jump to wherever has most upside potential, and WMT is the best hot stock in the market today. Buy WMT calls at open.  WMT is both a pandemic and a growth play now and has been largely ignored until now. Because of this, it went through a long period of consolidation (almost a year).  Now, this breakout pattern is one of the most bullish ones I've seen, technically speaking. When a breakout happens after a long period, the stock usually runs up for many days. It wouldn't surprise me if we see $140 before earnings.|2020-07-08 05:37:15

New York times article basically reiterates Robin hood is hooking their users on a gambling platform.  > He declined to comment on why Robinhood makes more than its competitors from the Wall Street firms. The company also declined to provide data on its customers’ performance.  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html  Gotta help break the myth that all these tards are obviously spreading.

These recent rally’s in tech have been because of fomo and nothing else. I really believe baba will be the next Tesla and have a week momentum/fomo run. Got in at 11ish am and already up over 100%.

xb7g5c|hnegmj|hnegmj|3|Been trying to understand the macro implications of monetary policy and the relationship to equity values instead of meme shitposting.  From 1965 to 1982, we were in an inflationary cycle, with interest rates hitting as high as 20%. Since 1982, when the deflationary cycle began, equities have been on a secular bull run. I believe the next major crash in the stock market will result in the end of this deflationary cycle (1982 to Present / Year out), as the next crash would mark the peak for deflation.  Afterwards, inflation would run rampant for a decade, and would lead to a "bull run" for energy, commodities, and return to industry and manufacturing, despite the Fed's best efforts in increasing interest rates and other measures. Of course, we will need another big crash after this parabolic run to initiate this phase. Bonds when interest rates peak in the next decade would be an excellent buy to take advantage of the following deflationary cycle when it initiates after the inflationary has passed.  The last inflationary cycle lasted nearly 20 years, which did not spell good news for the stock market. Whatever highs we crash from next time around will not be revisited for a significant time period.  I hope this made sense, and thank you for taking the time to read this macro theory outside of the typical day to day swings.|2020-07-08 08:31:34

xc7mld|hnegmj|hnegmj|6|Quick tip that helps me.  If something spikes more than 2-3% in less than 5 minutes. It’s an algo pump. Algos are never investors, NEVER. They pump it and dump it right away for pennies in profit if that have to. Beware of those big ass green dicks that pop out of no where when news hits the market.  If you’re going to fomo, fomo into a stock that is grinding up slowly throughout the day, that’s proof that real humans are buying. Humans are likely to hold much more than a computer programmed for profits at all cost.  Walmart is an example of an algo pump. Tesla slow grind up throughout the day is an example of humans buying. BABA buying is from humans. SQ is another examples of humans grinding the stock up.  It’s WSB vs computers and smart people.  Let’s be retarded smart.|2020-07-08 13:27:40

I believe the “lag” from Memorial Day to case spike (3 weeks approx.) will be much, much shorter for 4th of July. We may begin seeing a spike mid next week: 3-7 days to show symptoms and be tested.

xbwiun|hnegmj|hnegmj|5|I find it funny when people think Tech is corona immune. It is not about corona anymore, its about unemployment and reduced demand in coming months.  So will AAPL be able to sell as many phones/airpods, FB/GOOG will have as many ads as in the past and your AMZN is going to be 2 trillion company because grocery sales are up?  I feel sometimes people forget how Tech makes money. Just because you click Google may not necessarily mean all the companies that are facing reduced demand in coming months are also willing to advertise as they did in the past...  This is a consumption driven economy, and don't tell me consumption in 2020 and 2021 will be the same as 2019...|2020-07-08 12:01:56

By the way, WMT has more yearly revenue than Amazon and Apple combined.

Their advantage is 4500 stores across the US.  90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store.  Localized distribution is the only way to do grocery delivery at scale sustainably.  Amazon will be forced to acquire a large grocer to keep up.  Even then, they will be playing catch up.  The average American shops at a grocery store 1.7 times per week.  If you're already shopping for groceries, it's trivial to grab some non-perishables on the same website.  Amazon is actually in trouble here.|2020-07-08 06:53:43

xbaimx|hnegmj|hnegmj|3|Word to wise, the safe time to concentrate your "investments" into one or a few stocks is when shit looks bleakest, like March 13 - 23rd, peak fear. As market rises, it becomes increasingly risky to enter NEW concentrated positions, as there is more room to the downside as trough buyers have more motivation to convert to selling.  So, my point is, if you have a real portfolio to manage and not just your allowance for making your bed, it's really important to hold a basket of positions that you like for a few months out, then selectively move some money around from winners (like a TSLA spike) into the laggards through averaging down. In this way, you can expect a much higher likelihoods of net profit on the portfolio of options.   Hope this helps someone.  P.s. don't fucking kill yourself when you inevitably risk it all and lose|2020-07-08 09:00:52

Remember jet.com? $3B flush down the toilet, it's the loss porn we only dream of here.   Now you think their Prime competitor will work? Have you seen who shops at Walmart? Here's a tip, if you have an extra $100 in disposable income you're not a Walmart shopper. You're a classy broad who goes to Target. Nobody on earth is about to cancel Prime for Walmart scraps so who is the customer base for this?   There may be a short term pop on hype but this is a dog.|2020-07-08 07:53:17

Some of the bonds were linked to assets later revealed to be created by front companies for the ’Ndrangheta.  >The ’Ndrangheta is less well-known outside Italy than the Sicilian mafia but has risen over the past two decades to become one of the wealthiest and most feared criminal groups in the western world, engaging in crimes ranging from industrial-scale cocaine trafficking to money laundering, extortion and arms smuggling.   >Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, has estimated that the activities of the ’Ndrangheta, which is not made up of a centralised organisation but hundreds of autonomous clans, generate a combined turnover of €44bn a year.  >Other investors in the bonds included pension funds, hedge funds and family offices, all looking for exotic ways of earning high returns at a time of record-low interest rates, according to people involved in the deals.  >The bonds were created out of unpaid invoices to Italian public health authorities from companies providing them with medical services.  >Under EU law, overdue invoices owed by state-connected entities incur a guaranteed penalty interest rate. This makes them attractive for special purpose vehicles, which place them into a large pool of assets and issue bonds backed by the expected cash flows from the future settlement of the invoices.  >Most of the assets securitised in the deals were legitimate but some were from companies later revealed to be controlled by certain ’Ndrangheta clans, which had managed to evade anti-money laundering checks to take advantage of international investor demand for exotic debt instruments.  >One bond deal purchased by institutional investors contained assets sold by a refugee camp in Calabria that had been taken over by organised criminals. They were later convicted for stealing tens of millions of euros of EU funds.  >Almost all were private deals not rated by any credit rating agency or traded in financial markets. CFE, a Geneva-based boutique investment bank, constructed the vehicle that sold bonds to investors including Banca Generali.  >When contacted by the FT, Banca Generali said it was unaware of any problems with the underlying assets that backed the bonds it had purchased for its clients and that it had relied on other intermediaries to conduct anti-money laundering checks on the underlying portfolios.  >”Banca Generali and Banca Generali Fund Management Luxembourg are getting to know right now of the mentioned bad news,” the company said. It “rel[ied] on the notion that the transaction was eligible when [they] entered the securitised portfolio”, it added in an emailed statement.  >CFE said it had never knowingly purchased any assets linked to criminal activity. It added that it conducted significant due diligence on all the healthcare assets that it handled as a financial intermediary, and that it also relied on the checks of other regulated professionals who handled the invoices after their creation in Calabria.  >Both companies said that any legal issues that emerged after the invoices had been acquired were immediately reported to the Italian authorities. CFE said that the total amount of invoices later revealed to be linked to organised crime made up a very small proportion of the total amount of assets it had handled connected to the Italian health systems.  >EY, which was not required to conduct due diligence on the assets in the securitisation when providing consulting services for the structuring for one of the vehicles purchased by Banca Generali, declined to comment.  TLDR: Italian mafia got free money because no one did their DD. EY is another step closer to becoming the next Arthur Anderson.|2020-07-08 07:19:31

xc0gxb|hnegmj|hnegmj|1|I’ve had some winners, got into DVAX, TWO, WLL, at the right time. Played some good straddles on BAC the printed. Was up 100%. Then I started making bad choices, started with missing out on $500 quick gain at open because I had a shitty computer that froze. Bad omen. Then I started losing so I went into two “smart” moves trying to be smart, a straddle on AMC and M. My goal was I was hoping to get 5% a week. Those two decimated a 3rd of my portfolio as shit stocks that just ranged after I bought them, didn’t sell them early enough. Then I bought a bunch of Chinese companies that were getting a lot of options activity that didn’t do shit, until after I sold them, MOMO, NIO and TME that had I held would have tripled my account.

They have been wrongly hit by Teams competition from $MSFT, but if you work in Tech you know that Slack's product is a must for WFH. I mean $TEAM had Hipchat and was even working on a redesign of it, but then they killed it and partnered with Slack.   $WORK is still below IPO price from last year.

Once you reach a certain population viral load, people start getting sicker and sicker, and dying more often .  So the whole everyone catch covid at once strategy cannot possibly work because everyone is going to get incredibly sick. The stories of fit doctors, and families dying in China, was due to the insane viral load they were being exposed to, before the pandemic was flattened.  What's going to happen in the fattest, unhealthiest states, with the worst health care systems, is going to make anything besides New York, Italy, and whatever the hell happened in China look like a fun time.

xbd2nj|hnegmj|hnegmj|-4|Update: it turns out my dad actually listened when I explained how to DCA into NIO instead of just blowing out his avail cash account (as any responsible Boomer should know).   Took me all of premarket to explain the concept of PDT, and why the fact he doesn’t have to worry about it equates to profitability from short term gains. First, I had to google the length of capital asset holdings for normal adults because I’m poor and I got a C in accounting.   He bought 100 shares at $14 instead of 500 shares on impulse. **Then it took the fuck off to $15 at market open**  Tl;dr I’m a success at picking stocks now, understand basic investing concepts, but am still a failure as a child 😂😂😂   #Macbethgang|2020-07-08 09:24:09

xbundn|hnegmj|hnegmj|-7|hey guys, NIO puts. And never forget... this is all fake, the market, our politics, our media, our search engines. We are scammed by 8/10 companies we give our money to. Our broker's greed to make his own, the companies we establish business with marginalize us. Stop playing checkers when they are having a family game night of LIFE, Nascar themed MONOPOLY, and limited edition Harry Potter Edition Chess. Be smart end of day WSB, and be safe out there. Clear mind clear vision.. the system is not set up for you to win WIN SOME MORE. know when you are winning, and DO NOT STOP. rich poor same box ar the end of the day. The happiness isn't in the destination, its the path you take. Life is not bipartisan. Its a spectrum. Choose wisely.|2020-07-08 11:47:19
