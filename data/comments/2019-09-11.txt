zwsw1n|d2od9i|d2od9i|5|Serious question, how long on average will you be in a position for?  I have a bunch of October calls in stuff like V and MCD I got on Monday. With them being down over the part couple days I find myself obsessively checking their stock prices, WSB threads, etc. Multiple times an hour. I do this often when I'm in the green too even. In reality, there probably won't be any significant gains realized on those for another 1-2 weeks (assuming they're not dead anyway)   I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time and mental energy on this when I should be entering positions and checking 1-3x/day or something, exiting days or weeks later. Playing FDs has mostly just burned me.   I know this is WSB so probably a lot of degenerates in a similar position but I'm wondering what a good balance might look like.|2019-09-11 12:51:17

zwa45w|d2od9i|d2od9i|3|&#x200B;  California just passed substantial legislation, that will require $UBER to treat their contractors as employees.  That's going to massively increase their employment expenses, as well as require them to restructure a huge number of workflow processes, and create a ton of new legal requirements for how they treat their employees.  While I think the law is fair and just, there's no denying that the service is going to become more expensive for the consumer (Uber is already losing money as a company).  Or maybe I'm way off, and this is going to be a drop in the bucket for Uber's expenses.  I have no idea.  What is interesting, is that $UBER is actually UP 1% today.  That makes little sense to me.  Perhaps this bill was already priced-in, as a given.  (It wasn't much of a surprise that it passed through Cali's legislature.)  Maybe the markets expect a legal challenge from Uber and Lyft, that may significantly delay, curtail, or (if the challenge is successful) void the law altogether.|2019-09-11 09:23:48

zx3k0j|d2od9i|d2od9i|3|As a follow up on my comment about the new vaping regulations, I provide you this for free.  First:  What happened?  >Mr. Azar said it would take the administration several weeks to put out the final guidance on the new policy. **Then, after a 30-day period, all e-cigarettes, except for tobacco-flavored products, would have to be removed from the market.**  So they're banning vaping liquids that have minty or fruity flavors.  And that is that vast majority of them.  &#x200B;  >Manufacturers of tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes may continue to sell their products but must apply by May 2020 for a Food and Drug Administration review. Makers of all other e-cigarette flavors can also apply for FDA authorization, but their products would be off the market pending the review.  Then, there's still no guarantee that they'll even be allowed to sell tobacco flavored vaping liquids.  You have to get approval from the FDA to sell anything - until then, you're off the market.  ...  **$TPB** (Turning Point Brands) is a public company in their infancy, who has a third of their sales come from their "NewGen" line of products - IE:  a third of this company's revenue comes from vaping.  They've taken on a ton of debt to acquire vaping related companies (or at least partial ownership thereof).  &#x200B;  **Source for TPB's revenue numbers:**  Please see page 45 of their annual report, "Consolidated Results of Operations Data" (again, note that "NewGen" == Vaping segment):  [https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/turning\_point\_brands/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=13282777&Cik=0001290677&Type=PDF&hasPdf=1](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/turning_point_brands/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=13282777&Cik=0001290677&Type=PDF&hasPdf=1)  **Source for upcoming vaping ban:**  Story w/ full details of upcoming ban:   [https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-considering-ban-on-nontobacco-flavored-vaping-products-11568220504?mod=hp\_lead\_pos2](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-considering-ban-on-nontobacco-flavored-vaping-products-11568220504?mod=hp_lead_pos2)|2019-09-11 14:47:46

If $SPX closes at 3027.98 (All time high) you collect about $290. You only lose money if $SPX closes above 3030, max loss of \~$430 if it moons to 3035+.

Apple prints cash and continues to. That's all that matters. Innovation lol. Like that fucking matters?. They haven't innovated in years yet continue to make 50b+ every 3 months with good margin. Brand value is unparalleled  The greatest Investor in the world decided it was best to hold as much apple stock as possible in his portfolio.   And your idea is to short this? Good luck.|2019-09-11 07:05:12
