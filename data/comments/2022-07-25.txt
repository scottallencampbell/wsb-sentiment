hkd03r|w7kw98|w7kw98|10|This might be the most bullish week of the year:  1. Mega cap tech is likely to beat on earnings and guidance will be above expectations because their businesses haven't taken a lot of pain this year yet and won't until 4th quarter 2022 or 1st quarter 2023. 2. Fed will go for a 0.75 hike even though market is priced at 75% for a 0.75% rate hike and 25% for a 1% rate hike.  Meaning that a 0.75 rate hike will be dovish even though it's the most likely outcome (because all of the non-75bps expectations is at 100bps).  Combination of those two things could lead to an absolute spike upwards.  I still think we retest lows and go lower later on in the year but right now everyone's pretending as if there won't be a recession so just trade with the bullish trend.|2022-07-25 06:33:16

hl78nw|w7kw98|w7kw98|9|> The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee—the official recession scorekeeper—defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” The variables the committee typically tracks include real personal income minus government transfers, employment, various forms of real consumer spending, and industrial production. Notably, there are no fixed rules or thresholds that trigger a determination of decline, although the committee does note that in recent decades, they have given more weight to real personal income less transfers and payroll employment.          The Biden admin didn’t change the definition of a recession. Unemployment is still low, there is still strong consumer spending, and so on.|2022-07-25 10:30:21

They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know.  So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."|2022-07-25 05:34:37

It wasn't until 2002 that the narrative switched.  I think we may have to wait until really late this year or early 2023 to see mega caps finally pull back to pre-Covid levels.

hlr7f8|w7kw98|w7kw98|5|For all those that are not paying attention, the Fed cannot unwind $9T in assets on its balance sheet without causing a recession. QT just started and the equity markets are getting kicked in the balls. We are at maximum employment and GDP is solid and look what QT is doing and it's just the tip to see how it feels.   There will be no rate retreats at this point, as some of you bulls think. That would require further swelling of the Fed's balance sheet. If they can't unwind $9T safely with ideal conditions, no way in hell do they think they can do so at 10, 11 or 12T..   In short, rate hikes are coming fast and furious, buckle up.|2022-07-25 12:37:01

hkgggy|w7kw98|w7kw98|2|IBM (then general of the market, safe mega cap tech) went up 250% from 1998 to 2000.  AMZN (then speculative tech) went up 1,500% from 1998 to 2000.  IBM was within 10% of its high at the end of 2001.  AMZN was down 90-95% at the end of 2001.  Then IBM collapsed in 2002 while AMZN went sideways.  Insert AAPL or TSLA (MSFT/GOOG as well) for IBM now.  Insert ARKK (and corn, SPACs) for AMZN now.  The point is the generals will hold on a lot longer than anyone thinks is possible.  IBM was within 10% of its ATH more than *18 months* after the tech bubble popped in early 2000.  AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOG will hold on and trade well through the remainder of this year; next year is when they give back the excess bubble gains.|2022-07-25 07:07:10

hkxb08|w7kw98|w7kw98|0|Looking at the CME fedwatch tool, market has pretty much priced in 3.25-3.50% fed funds rate by EOY which is pretty much where initial predictions were when feds began to raise rates. Powell did say the $SPY was more likely to hit $380 than go back to ATH which he felt was "appropriate" for what the feds were trying to do. Considering we are now sitting ~$400 after a round of earnings, this seems like the peak until more good news can push the markets higher. Not a ground breaking take, but it will really dependon how dovish/hawkish the feds get this week imo. Obviously, everyone also has their eyes on $AAPL's earnings on Thursday.|2022-07-25 09:22:47

hm1hcm|w7kw98|w7kw98|-2|Serious question: I broke into career B (used to be a career A). Making $110K in NYC now but pretty sure I can get atleast that much with career A. New job is super stressful, lots of hours, and very demanding. But the culture is better and more people my age. At career A I had a super chill gig, but it wasn't quite challenging enough. However, I could always switch companies or move up. My mom is worried I'm taking the "easy way out" since I'm only 3.5 months into career B and that it's good to work hard. But I literally am miserable and don't have time for hobbies and stuff as much. At career A my free time is insane. And any unfulfillment or lack of challenge I feel I can read or learn in my spare time for personal growth. What would you do?|2022-07-25 13:42:19
