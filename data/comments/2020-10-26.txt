a6m3zi|jibzmg|jibzmg|4|Quick DD:  Today's COVID update will be small due to weekend lag. Tomorrow's case number will gap up. There are no big earnings reports AH today, so you still have a window to throw down SPY/QQQ puts today or tomorrow morning. A new record COVID number tomorrow is almost assured, and the next chance for a big company to beat earnings and pop the whole market is MSFT/AMD tomorrow after close.  Also, the government is busy with the Supreme Court today so there's a window before any stimulus hail mary.  Good luck out there!|2020-10-26 12:02:51

Whatever firm or firms that did that are not going to allow the spot VIX to fall too low as to destroy the value of that hedge.  I think as soon as that contract gets unwound, after the election, the market is going to make a big move in direction or the other.  With the election result as the perfect excuse I bet there's a sharp selloff to unload those contracts at a profit before the standard FED-backed V rally takes us to new highs in 2021.|2020-10-26 09:20:22

Don't get faked out, this is likely not the bottom unless earnings this week are really good.  Edit: If we bounce and confirm an hourly bear flag into the close, I'm going to be watching for a support at the 100 DMA at 329.75. If we gap down open near that level tomorrow, I'm a buyer.

A solid floor to keep it from sinking and a strong ceiling to keep it from floating away.  The floor and ceilings are always on the moving averages. If it pierces one floor it will try the next until if find solid ground.   There will be a dead cat bounce when it finds the floor. It could be a fast moving call opportunity, but you can‚Äôt fuck around. Get in, get out.   We are in a pre-market dead cat right now.|2020-10-26 07:45:19

People are going to stop "going" to events like the superbowl,and start to "zoom" over to it by putting on their VR goggles. And that moment in time and space will become immortalized for all to experience forever.  Apple putting lidar in their phones means we aren't far off from things like videos on YouTube containing their own Metadata of 3D environments.

a6g6i2|jibzmg|jibzmg|0|Don't listen to the negative headlines about people traveling. I travel every week for work and the airports are crowded.  It has been very gradual but it has clearly increased to the point where the airports are packed.  Traffic has picked up in the streets as well.  I went to Mortons last week on a Friday and it was crowded.  Only the Morton employees wore masks.  Cases are way up but the deaths as a % of cases are way down.  The stimulus will happen.  Not today and maybe not tomorrow but it will happen and the market will have to react to it.  If this selloff is because of the virus then it needs to continue to selloff until the end of the year because these numbers are not going to get better.  This is all BS and I think we are at or above 350 on the SPY by end of year.  PS: I would not confuse what happened to SAP with the tech sector.  SAP sells crappy software and has been riding past strength. All the other tech companies are eating their lunch including Microsoft with Dynamics.

a5tnkh|jibzmg|jibzmg|2|Its along one but WORTH IT  Couple of my bros, one of their friends I didn't know, and I were drinking at these two bishes apartment and we got em drunk enough to agree to an orgy. I grew up, played football, shared a locker room with my two friends so we all seen each others cawks before so it wasn't weird. But the other guy was being real shy about it. Us three were already weiner-out getting a chub going for the girls and he's kinda just standing in his boxers. It comes his turn to get sucked off and she pulls his boxers down.  . . Dude has a 1.33333 incher. We're just like oh fuk this is gonna ruin the evening so she starts giving him head anyway while her friend starts riding all of us. By then he's graduated into maybe a 1.5.  So she turns around to help her friend out with us and he gets behind her and puts it in. She kinda just giggles a couple times then he starts clapping the cheeks faster and harder than anything I've ever seen. He's hitting it so hard her eyes roll up in her head. After about 2 minutes of that she collapses in the floor squirting all over that dude.. we just finished up with the one Sloot and left him there..|2020-10-26 07:44:58

It's all voodoo right?  For anyone who thinks that, please consider that Technical Analysis is a tool, just like Fundamental Analysis. It doesn't predict the future, it just provides a visual guide that you can use to time your entries/exits. It's a visualization of price action/volume, and psychological levels that people do in fact use to trade off of.  Even if it's made up nonsense, the simple fact that so many people use it makes it a viable tool. Just like money, it's valueless paper until we agree that it has value. TA is the same psychologically - it has value as a tool if enough people use it.  Good luck.|2020-10-26 10:09:11

a70nj1|jibzmg|jibzmg|0|Im playing AMD and AMZN  Both should be very safe in theory and should beat earnings comfortably  Here are my cases:  ***AMD***  They will provide hardware for the new xbox and PS5.  As you are all very aware, they have dropped the prices significantly for the new gen consoles = more affordable = more people will buy = more units ordered, will be great for AMD  AMDs new architecture is looking great, they are eating market share from Intel. September steam survey says about 25% PCs now have AMD. Huge jump from previous years, when it was like 8% IIRC.  Intel has no new products, and they have not released shit since 2018. They have also tanked hard in the past week earnings = more bullish for AMD going forward.  ***AMZN***  Has some room to go up.  Its AMZN, during a pandemic, people are bored and i'm sure theres a million retards browsing AMZN and impulse buying shit all the time (not to mention stuff that is needed). And well, it's AMZN.  I am not expecting a huge move, but it should be some profit nonethesless.  Ok, now tell me why im retarted|2020-10-26 13:59:44

This will be sporadic and random as to dilute the price movements upward. We‚Äôll keep having a green trend upward over the next few weeks to months but we are waiting for a short squeeze that will never come. Only way short squeeze can still occur is if there is some crazy good news that comes out of left field. Maybe another huge institutional buyer or some crazy good numbers for ER.
