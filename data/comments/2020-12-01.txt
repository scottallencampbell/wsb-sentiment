Straight up like 3,000 calories 100 grams of fiber, ate it in like 25 minutes in 1 sitting. 6 hours later my insides were being torn apart and I had the longest fart I've ever been able to muster. Imagine for a second you thought you had to shit, and you take a deep breath, and you push, and it's just a pure fart for your entire breath, after about 15 seconds you're trying not to laugh but you're in complete disbelief that you're still farting, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. Air still coming out your butt hole, you have to take a SECOND fucking breath to finish the fart off.. You didn't even have to shit..  Anyways, TSLA to the moon|2020-12-01 07:50:41

Now that's pretty clear that they're trying to pander to the kind of investors who would be more willing to just take it on faith that the company has more than a couple concept drawings if you ask me.

You sit on sidelines.   Thursday: Shit opens red due to magic numbers and you buy puts. V shaped recovery intraday.   Friday: We gap up hard and you sell puts at a loss.

I live in a relatively nice suburb and I don’t ever see homeless where I live. So sad. Scared me half to death at first though, I thought it was a dead body until the guy fuckin moved. I ran the other direction but then after a bit of walking I started feeling really awful that someone would have little to no options that they have to sleep on a gravel paved trail in a sleeping bag.|2020-12-01 08:14:42

e97xgh|k4ixya|k4ixya|7|> Its IPO prospectus showed the company has seen annual net losses every year since its launch, and it warned that it may not be able to ever turn a profit. For the nine months ending on September 30th, Airbnb saw a net loss of $696.9 million on revenue of $2.52 billion, compared to a loss of $322.8 billion for the same period last year.  Firstly I’m sure 322 Billion is a typo  Secondly, it’s so weird to me that a company can release a statement along the lines of “we may never be profitable ever” and people still be excited about it|2020-12-01 07:19:12

ea1v0w|k4ixya|k4ixya|6|Here is Papa Musk's mail in full. If you are buying TSLA now you are up for a hard reckoning.  "At a time like this, when our stock is reaching new highs, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true.  When looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that’s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer!  Much more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money. This a tough Game of Pennies – requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simply the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.  In order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.  Thanks and great working with you as always, Elon"|2020-12-01 11:43:43

ea34p0|k4ixya|k4ixya|5|Wonder if the GME squeeze is so mathematically guaranteed that even the MMs can't keep it down with all the mentions here.  Numbers are numbers. Shorts got caught going in deep years ago when Gamestop was actually going out of business, but it seem like they might have a turn-around in store. Its not really meme-strength for us... we just caught some autists on the other side of our trade for once.  Would be like if someone shorted BB years ago when they were a shit smartphone maker dwindling to nothing struggling to switch to an enterprise software company, only to get hit with a headline that fucking Amazon wants to work with them on Automotive AI. Now what? That shit aint going down any time soon. If they land more clients, what would those shorts do? Thats what is happening with GME.|2020-12-01 11:53:38

e9e5ob|k4ixya|k4ixya|3|So SPY has gained 35 bucks in the past month, meaning there is a chance we could potentially hit 400 by New Years if it continues to have a strong month. I'm thinking of stopping this weeklies yolo shit I've been doing and instead buying 15ish 1/4 calls in the 375 range and let it sit to see what happens. Any good reason not to? It'll be a long month of waiting and some angst if and when SPY dips when it does, but the *potential* to turn 3k in to 15k or more (25k if it does hit 400 by 1/4) in a month's time seems too good to pass up.|2020-12-01 08:25:51

eagp0l|k4ixya|k4ixya|3|Notes on sentiment:  1) Tom Lee calls 100% chance of melt up into end of year   2) Everyone following stocks, yes all of them, are calling for a breakout in the QQQs, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, etc., after a three month long “consolidation”. Mega cap tech heading much higher into year end is the obvious trade idea that everyone loves  3) Seasonality being bullish is consensus view (everyone looking at same indicators)  4) Have seen multiple people all over spiking the football saying stocks had best month since 87 after 🥭 said markets would crash if sleepy were elected   5) Yellen and JPow are the dream team of accommodation   To me that so many people are bullish on megacap tech is a big problem going forward. Just seems every person I follow loves this breakout idea. Will be interesting to see if mega cap tech complies for an extended period with what so many want to happen.|2020-12-01 13:39:22

Tim dives deeper, people are making a lot of money. Life changing money. buying something called calls on PLTR. It's a stock. Tim's Dad knows all about stocks.   30 min till work. He run downstairs and try to explain to his dad this PLTR and Calls, then shows him the link. Dad seems unsure but says he'll give it a shot. he copys someone elses play but notices this 12/4 $35 call is really cheap at only .13 cents. "what a steal" he buys 100,000 contracts at .13 thinking it's shares. "This isn't too bad".  Tim rushes down the stairs in his Wendy's uniform. Did you do it Dad? "Yes son, I used a little bit of our savings to test the waters" Nice! exclaimed Tim.   Tuesday:   Tim and Dad are staring at the bronkerage screen in despair. I don't understand! What's a margin call ??? why are they calling me? Tims dad calls the bronkerage, they explain to him why he's a dumbass and why he should have never visited that forum. Tim breaks all ties with his bff who sold on Monday and took his monster gains. Tim cries everynight as his father stares at the locked gun display on the mantle.

If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.  LMAO this is not a stretch AT ALL.  So first we need to miss earnings (which apparently is a certainty all of a sudden), have the board fire the CEO, and then hire some guy who owned a pet company.  Love simultaneously shilling how great GME is financially but now they will fire the CEO because of a miss after the stock has gone up 500% since April.|2020-12-01 10:52:12

eas120|k4ixya|k4ixya|2|Hear me out tards. Academy sports (ASO) has their first earnings report next week since their IPO a few months ago and I’m optimistic. Where I live in the south they are way popular than Dicks Sporting Goods and for the past year they have been pushing credit cards to everyone with good benefits and I think it’s gonna reflect strongly on their earnings. Share price rn is at $16 but I expect that to go up a good bit considering Dicks sporting goods is at 50 something.  Disclaimer: I am retarded and have no idea if there is any correlation but I do know they have a lot of room to grow since their IPO a couple months ago and are up 39% since then|2020-12-01 15:07:07

(NASD:CNXC) will be added to the S&P MidCap 400 effective prior to the open of trading on Tuesday, December 1. Concentrix will take the place of AMC Networks Inc. (NASD:AMCX), which will replace R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. (NYSE:RRD) in the S&P SmallCap 600 effective prior to the opening of trading on Wednesday, December 2. S&P MidCap 400 constituent SYNNEX Corp. (NYSE:SNX) is spinning off Concentrix in a transaction expected to be completed post close on November 30. SYNNEX will remain in the S&P MidCap 400 post-spin-off. AMC Networks is more representative of the small-cap market space, and R.R. Donnelley & Sons is no longer appropriate for the S&P SmallCap 600.

China Automotive Systems revealed that it shipped about 120,000 of it electric power-steering products for use in EVs made in China. And the company is expecting to sell more than 140,000 units of its steering products this year and around 200,000 units next year.

Have a masters degree I just finished up but no one in my field is hiring due to COVID.   Part of me wants to just go apply to work at a bar to build up more of a social life again. No bars gonna hire now though probably with potential shutdowns looming 🤷‍♂️.|2020-12-01 10:14:54

Today there will be a battle at 17.30-17.51, If you can get this fucking thing above 17.51 and higher pre-market its going to run when market opens, Now how do i do that mr yelling at me man?     Go onto your Robinwhore accounts and pre market queue up buy orders for single shares at 17.20,17.21,17.22 and so forth, run this fucker up and manipulate its pre market price to the point where the TA boys and the Algo boys have to jump on because its fucking running and the train might start to generate its own steam.     Or dont and go back to your job and wendies.  Because you can be fucking sure just snapping up all the shares at the current price will end up with you holding bags and the market price being manipulated down 10% by EOD on like sub 8,000,000 volume. They will short this fucker to keep it down today. Run it up.|2020-12-01 07:07:54

e96ni3|k4ixya|k4ixya|-10|More Americans Pay Rent On Credit Cards As Lawmakers Fail To Pass Relief Bill   CHRIS ARNOLD · NOVEMBER 30, 2020  With their savings running out, many Americans are being forced to use credit cards to pay for bills they can't afford — even their rent. Housing experts and economists say this is a blinking-red warning light that without more relief from Congress, the economy is headed for even more serious trouble.  There's been as much as a 70% percent increase from last year in people paying rent on a credit card, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. "If you're putting your rent payments on to a credit card, that shows you're really at risk of eviction," says Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project. "That means you've run out of savings; you've probably run out of calls to family members to get them to loan you money."   Marine Madesclaire could be faced with the choice of paying her rent on credit, too. Before the pandemic hit, she felt like she was hitting her stride. The 29-year-old Los Angeles actor was doing lots of auditions and managing to land at least some quick appearances in Hollywood films. To pay the bills, she had a gig doing modeling work at Las Vegas trade shows. "You go to the conventions, and you stand and look pretty next to, insert product," she says. "And it paid very, very well. I had been traveling."  But all that stopped in March. Since then, Madesclaire has been among millions of unlucky people who've faced long delays getting unemployment benefits. It appears she should qualify. But it's been more than six months, and she still hasn't received any unemployment money. "It's been so long that I don't cry about it anymore," she says. "I used to, like, have full-blown meltdowns about it." She depleted her savings just to eat and pay bills. She's run up more than $10,000 in credit card debt.   Madesclaire has asked her card issuer Chase for help. But she says except for waiving some late fees, the bank hasn't done much to help her. She says the 16% interest is sinking her even deeper into debt. "They're charging me interest and late fees," she says. "And up until like a week ago, they also were calling me like five times a day until I told them to please stop." Chase said in a statement to NPR that it has enrolled many customer accounts in "payment assistance" plans. The bank says it doesn't charge them late fees, but it does keep charging interest. Madesclaire was finally able to find a low-wage job at a computer repair store. But while that just barely covers her monthly bills, she's still four months behind on her rent. A state eviction moratorium in California will protect her until the end of January, or she says she would have paid her rent on a credit card, too. "If the choice is debt or homelessness," she says, "I'm going to go in as much debt as I can." Some people just pay that way for convenience. But for many others it's an act of desperation.  The National Housing Law Project's Roller notes that there's a federal order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aimed at preventing evictions. But it's not an outright ban, and many people don't know the order exists or how it can protect them. So he says it's not working very well. There have already been thousands of evictions in Houston, Memphis, Tenn., Richmond, Va., Columbus, Ohio, and other areas, Roller says. "It's bad for public health, it's bad for the families that are involved," he says. "It's bad for all of us as a country." It could also be just the tip of the iceberg. And it's not just housing rights groups that are worried. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, estimates about 10 million Americans owe back rent. And without another robust relief bill from Congress, he expects to see "mass eviction" starting early next year.  "Just think about that for a second," he says. "This is all going to be happening in the dead of winter, in the middle of a raging pandemic. I mean, I can't even construct a darker scenario." Zandi says even if they don't lose their housing, millions of other Americans will fall deeper into debt. And he says so many people continuing to suffer financially will hurt the whole economy. "I think odds are very high that we're going to go back into recession," he says, "if lawmakers can't get it together early next year and pass a fiscal rescue package." Zandi says, "It's absolutely critical that lawmakers step up." As part of the federal aid, he and Roller would both like to see an effective nationwide eviction moratorium, combined with money to pay landlords the rent they are owed to keep them from going under, too.|2020-12-01 07:03:21
eab82t|k4ixya|k4ixya|-7|My mother has been getting into Trading lately with me, she works retail and has a very high IQ of what is going on in companies based around earnings, announcements and even employee schedules. Tomorrow BBY will be announcing company wide whether or not they will revert back to curbside only. This is a hint on to what’s going to be happening soon with government shutdowns amid covid rising. Personally, I am a Bull but I feel like our months and months of growth could abruptly be coming to an end soon. When school lets out for winter break, I think we will be seeing a significant increase in more statewide shutdowns, not to mention that COVID testing from thanksgiving will be added statistically throughout the week. NYS is clawing to a 5% positive rate and will only increase.   This being said, I am putting on my 🌈🐻🧢 on and targeting clothing retailers and restaurants that performed very poorly after that March decline earlier this year. Our time is running out, sad to say that but it has been a good ride. I am preparing for a pretty sizable dip and positioned myself at GPS 14p 1/15/2021 and BLMN 12.5p 1/15/2021. Not very high in value right now but with shutdown talks increasing and vaccines not available until about March, we won’t be seeing significant 🚀🚀🚀🚀s (with the exception of EVs of course[not NIO🗑]). Stimulus will also carry the market too but still, people need essentials during shutdown, not Gap clothes or bloomin’ onions Lol.   But anyways, we’re all entitled to our own predictions and opinions, the market is too good to be true right now, it’s as if it’s a dream!

If I’m able to get back all the gains I got from last week then I’m taking it out. I’m only leaving some shares for PLTR and if it still goes to hell even when the vaccines come out then I’m done with the stock market for a while.   Another note if you put your live savings and lose it all you absolutely deserve it. If you get M’s then congrats to you seriously.

I've tried google chrome, firefox and microsoft edge but the same thing happens on all browsers, all pages on Robinhood load absolutely fine except the 'sign up' page so I can't make an account!  Does anyone have any ideas of why this might be? Or what I can do to rectify the issue?  Thanks in advance lads and ladies, hope you all made lots of monies today.|2020-12-01 10:31:34
