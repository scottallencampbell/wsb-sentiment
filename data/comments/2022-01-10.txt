s44ie1|s0hh6w|s0hh6w|1|I have made comments in the past that if you want a good stock to gamble on, buy BCRX and be prepared to hold for a few years. Within 3 years I think this is a decent 20-50X opportunity. It is up nicely today, although still off its high of about 18. Think decent chance it can run to 20+ in the next few weeks.  Myself, I hold about 14K shares and 250 (250x100) Jan 19 2024 $30 calls. Down a little there still. Have thought about doing a dfv style posting with the position every month but not really my thing. I am very confident that by the time those calls are up the share price will be well over $50 (I think over $100 is very possible) based on solid fundamentals.

The "thank you kind stranger" shit, the comment threads that build on some reference or pun where everyone adds some kind of variation, the replies that are just a subreddit name like r/rareinsults and r/whoosh, all of it is fucking annoying. It's like watching poorly socialized people attempt to make some kind of "cool kids club".  I'd like to add a point that Reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely "oof", "yikes", and "le" ("Doggo" and "pupper" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. It's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source. Yikes|2022-01-10 13:07:37

s2jgev|s0hh6w|s0hh6w|1|From SA:  * "ViacomCBS gets upgrade, as Deutsche Bank sees higher streaming revenue in the future" * Analyst Bryan Kraft raised his price target to $43, up from $39, noting that ViacomCBS (VIAC) could be re-rated higher, but it also offers investors "greater success    in streaming, and potential industry consolidation as megacap tech sets    its sights on becoming bigger streaming players, while current media    industry players also potentially look for additional scale    opportunities." * Kraft noted that ViacomCBS trades at the lowest enterprise value to    sales multiples, at 1.2 times 2022 estimates, in his coverage area. It    also gets little credit for its streaming revenue, compared to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). "If VIAC were to trade at 8x 2022E streaming revenue, it would trade at $61," Kraft noted.|2022-01-10 09:07:42

Plus when everyone finally gets CronRona and we aren't scared of it anymore, we're going back to the greatest economy in the history of the world.

s3aexg|s0hh6w|s0hh6w|1|A little inside baseball talk.  I understand the reason for indiscriminate selling today, but LOW should not be a full % point lower than HD intraday.  LOW is making inroads into the pro / contractor segment, home equity is at an all time high, and they, like HD, are a top 10 company for buybacks.   TLDR, LOW and HD should converge on a % down today, and LOW's 20% lower p/e rate should make it climb higher  Hopefully the algos can read the king's English|2022-01-10 11:54:52

s279ir|s0hh6w|s0hh6w|0|**On $ALGS - My Recap on Aligos Therapeutics:**  **Material on their website has been updated, including focusing in on the JP Morgan presentation. My take is that they still have the core strategy and focus in place regarding CHB. The premature ending of a phase 1 from last week had a Hep. focus so does not present a negative on their CHB strategy. With the CHB and NASH focus (NASH with Merck), this remains a vibrant biotech to keep an eye on. An FIP (first in patient) notation seems to be marked for sometime mid to end of January. The price is battered down needlessly due to excessive shorting but will recover to at least a mid point between 4 and 17. Full disclosure, I bought in last Thursday for a tiny round, and may add depending on if it maintains a lower price point. All this is my opinion only.**|2022-01-10 07:39:12
