3qdt6o|dhp0t0|dhp0t0|7|Because today is fucking flat and gay I'm just going to do **Magical Crayons TA.**  Because of a flat and gay trading day, we've actually broken weekly momentum's trendline and lowered the resistance level from 305 to 301. Intuitively this makes some sense given the uncertainty of the trade deal, which had been set to rocket us to higher highs this week. Indicators are still bullish, with new supports at 292 vs the 287 supports we had last week.  Given the volatility of last week and upcoming earnings, long term trends are difficult to predict. Looking ahead, previous cases recently has shown that the market generally prices in rate cut news more than actual realization. We've had the market bump from the shift to 90% belief in rate cuts already, so unless the size of the cut changes we may not see further increases at the Fed meeting later in the month. We're in a holding pattern until we can see what earnings tell us this week, with major financial institutions reporting this week and tech thereafter.

Mnuchin says in an interview that the December tariff hikes absolutely will happen and will not be removed until a FULL deal is reached. But that he anticipates reaching a full deal before December 15th.     The next set of high level trade talks could come as soon as later this month.

Sure nostalgia is great, but today's kids want Frozen, not the original 1950s version of movies like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast.

From my anecdotal experience, a lot of subscribers keep Netflix because it has a massive variety of content that specifically caters to non-white ethnicities. For example, my girlfriend is currently bingeing this Korean Netflix original drama, even though she isn't Asian. My parents are watching the new Indian Netflix shows and love them. My black friends use Netflix to watch movies that cater to them culturally. I don't know much about Hispanic content on Netflix, but I know Disney has absolutely nothing for that demographic based on the content list that they released today. This is where Hulu lacks too, and I don't see Disney+ bridging that gap.   Disney's market is families with kids, and the subscription does not seem worthwhile for entire family use like Netflix and Amazon are. America is becoming less and less Caucasian every year; the white market is shrinking. From what I see, Netflix and Amazon are heavily investing in multicultural content and Disney isn't.  Disney+ is, at it's core, an on demand Disney channel replacement. Netflix is a comprehensive Dish/cable replacement.|2019-10-14 14:31:31
