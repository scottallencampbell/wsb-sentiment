Increase the debt ceiling let inflation run and our dollars become as valuable as toilet paper.  Or  Let this market die, send half the country into poverty because they are stupid and over extended, margined to the hilt (credit cards, cars, homes) let the people who actually know how to use money pick up the pieces we dust ourselves off and move forward.

For over half the commodities BHP sell like petroleum and copper, and I'd say over half the major commodities BHP don't sell like soy and sugar, there's a similar pattern of running up for the early portion of the 1 year chart and then plateauing for months, refusing to dip into buying opportunity territory and theta trapping folks. BHP on the other hand ran up for the early portion of the 1 year chart, plateaued, and then ended up back at the price it was at a year ago, and with a P/E around 12. To me this seems like it might be Santa offering a late second chance to bet on inflation for those who missed the run up a year ago|2021-09-28 13:38:46

Stocks (especially big cap/growth tech) face downward pressure until 10 year is back at the 1.7-1.8 range like March.  1.7-1.8 is where yields looked overbought (bonds oversold) last time.  The bond market tantrum is probably why this feels a lot different from the usual dips the past couple months; this is more like March's dip.

All of the old movies that Disney had were remade. All of the theme park rides, were then made into a movie. ATARI is sitting there with a wealth of connection to millions of people. The old titles are very familiar names...but they need to be updated. Technology has come a long way since ATARI was created. I find myself scrolling through a competitor's list of games I can download...most of them I don't know and never heard of. I already know Space Invaders, Asteroids, Missal Command and many many more. Much like I already knew about 101 Dalmatians, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in Wonderland, etc...|2021-09-28 12:56:43
