While conditions seem “fine” at the moment, nobody knows if the hurricane is “a minor one or Superstorm Sandy,” he added.   “You better brace yourself,” Dimon told the roomful of analysts and investors. “JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we’re going to be very conservative with our balance sheet.“|2022-06-01 09:47:57

aso04z|v2ddzd|v2ddzd|3|A wsb bull is at an airport and sees a plane take off. He gets super excited and runs to the counter to ask how many open seats are on the plane. The ticketing agent says 30 and the bull demands to buy 15 tickets. The agent sighs, and fulfills his request. The plane goes higher and the bull rushes back to the counter and decides to buy the rest. He then runs to the parkinglot where he meets wsb bear. Bear sees what bull is charging, so he decides to borrow the shares for a fee and try to sell them to a crackhead. The crackhead looks at them both in bewilderment and tries to explain to them both that the plane has already left the airport, but they drop their pants and proceed to loudly shit all over each other while they jerk themselves off, shouting nonsense about "easing and tightening" at nobody in general.|2022-06-01 10:24:54

asyprx|v2ddzd|v2ddzd|3|I keep seeing so many people ask about GME & whether it’s up or down after earnings. I’m gonna give it to you straight.   GME will miss earnings & tank. Tank hard. THEN it’ll slowly come up and by morning either be green OR a “few” dollars away from it ($3-$7). Then come Thursday/Friday unless something happens that tanks the entire market (like -500 shit) it’ll be green and moon.   I promise you that if you buy puts, you’re fucked. But also if you buy calls you’re fucked. Do not touch that thing until AFTER earnings. This way you don’t get IV crush and if anything it’ll run into next week.|2022-06-01 11:40:33

as5za0|v2ddzd|v2ddzd|1|Consistent with the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in January 2022, all Committee participants agreed to the following plans for significantly reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.  The Committee intends to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA). Beginning on June 1, principal payments from securities held in the SOMA will be reinvested to the extent that they exceed monthly caps. For Treasury securities, the cap will initially be set at $30 billion per month and after three months will increase to $60 billion per month. The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon maturities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills. For agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, the cap will initially be set at $17.5 billion per month and after three months will increase to $35 billion per month. Over time, the Committee intends to maintain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime. To ensure a smooth transition, the Committee intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves. Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve balances will likely continue to decline for a time, reflecting growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities, until the Committee judges that reserve balances are at an ample level. Thereafter, the Committee will manage securities holdings as needed to maintain ample reserves over time. The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments.|2022-06-01 08:06:42

arykie|v2ddzd|v2ddzd|1|The Federal Reserve is about to start shrinking its $8.9 trillion balance sheet, deploying a second tool along side higher interest rates to curb inflation, though officials don’t know just how effective it will be.  After doubling in size through asset purchases in the first two years of the pandemic, the balance sheet will be reduced at a pace that’s almost twice as fast as after the last financial crisis. While the process officially commences on Wednesday, the first US Treasury securities won’t run off until $15 billion mature on June 15.  The Fed is capping monthly runoff at $47.5 billion -- $30 billion for Treasuries and $17.5 billion for mortgage-backed securities -- until September. Those thresholds will then double to a combined $95 billion. That compares to a peak of $50 billion a month when the Fed performed the exercise starting in 2017.  -Bloomberg|2022-06-01 06:56:19
