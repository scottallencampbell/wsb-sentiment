How long will this market continue to teeter at the top of a huge cliff on what is the most overpriced market in history by almost every fundamental metric? How much longer will we trade sideways? The dot com and housing crashes didn't have any one event that triggered their respective crashes...but now that Fed support is gone and interest rates are known to be rising soon the big trigger selloff day (more than 5%, probably a circuit breaker) should be any day now.|2022-01-13 14:25:39

sjaoil|s2wwtk|s2wwtk|6|SPY does this every month, just not exactly in the same pattern, but it does tend to revolve around the same ratios between the runs. Options activity rules pricing action now because FDs are such a huge part of the machine now. It's that simple. We shouldn't be surprised with a dip to the SMMA 20/50 on any given month. We're very much not outside of the normal pattern, though the reach down to the SMMA 50 earlier this week and some of the tightening of the ratio does suggest a potential correction COULD happen, we're not wildly outside of what SPY does on any given month.  The NASDAQ is another story, and that could keep bleeding for a bit, but it's already in a correction space. That will oscillate around options and bond rates, too, though.  Bulls, don't despair that the rally didn't continue, the market is still on an overall bullish trend. Bears are trying to psych you out, don't let them. There's a bearish tone right now to the market, but a crash is not in these cards based on these current numbers... a correction further? Maybe.|2022-01-13 14:44:50

shsp17|s2wwtk|s2wwtk|10|I just posted this for that kid who started with 5K went up to 90k and is back to 8K.  &#x200B;  Thought of posting it here as well in case it helps even one single young gun out there. All jokes aside, there is definitely truth to it, and many will attest not just me.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Listen to this. You will hear from many that you are just 18 and you have a lot of time to make more money than that.     Read this very very carefully. I was told the exact same thing. I am wired completely retarded. Every time I lost when I was young, folks used to tell me - that's okay, you have a long life ahead of you to make it back. I'm wired to that now even at 40 now, and am so used to gamble the crap, and lose money that I do not even have.         The point I am trying to make is to not stop trading. Even though you may see a lot of posts showing YOLOs and large percentage profits, learn to take profits, and make sure you are also taking losses when the trade does not go your way, and even more importantly learn to manage the account.      These three points are so freaking important, again, they are so freaking important to not lose it all or to not lose huge amounts when trades do not go our way. All the hype around 1000% profits and 100K to million dollar yolos are just that - hype. They are very rare.         Do not get enticed by that. Create a system - work it out by making smaller trades - figure out what you are comfortable to not lose sleep on. My brain has now been wired to diamond hand losses to zero and, take profits at maybe 50% or leave the larger % profits until it goes back to zero and lose it all.         Having said all of that, do not let trading take you over like an addiction. And hold your chin high, you still ended positively. You are much much less retarded than most of us here. That number is very very possibly close to 90% ( yes, I pulled that number out of my ass, based on the comments daily.) Good luck and have a safe life, do not become a slave to rush trading and lose everything you have and more a few times in life.         If you want I can be available to tell my story and how my addiction has ruined me and my family ( not to scare you but rather to set in some reality behind all the hype)|2022-01-13 09:09:19

We are with 11,5million gamblers today, but are not able to act together anymore.  We splitted our buy power in 50 different meme stocks and got destroyed by Hedge Funds.  Long story short.

I decided to look at this subreddit for the first time since I heard about it a year ago, and one of the first posts I see is someone who lost 80% of their portfolio.  I thought that was weird, but when I scrolled down I saw another who lost a similar amount in a longer period of time.  Then I check the loss flair and there seems to be one every few days of similar magnitude.  What are you doing to lose that much money in such a short amount of time? Is this what options are?

If you can't get 50% by just even guessing a $20 spread on the majority of options (and using your day trades wisely if applicable), you shouldn't be playing in this casino.   Best of luck on your YOLO though and the market isnt a team sport.  Edit: to clarify about team sport, I have some DSR GME and GME on another broker. DSR will sit. Broker is for sale on profit.

si9gix|s2wwtk|s2wwtk|0|I was checking out yesterday and the cashier noticed my Wall Street bets shirt “getting some tendies” she asked. I was furious she would ask that. Shut up bitch. I responded. She began ringing up my items and I noticed I made a huge mistake. When I was building my pants I still had the “Vienna sausage deposit” on my left pocket. It was from the blueprints. There was currently a stolen can of Vienna sausages in my pocket as I was checking. The cashier glanced down and saw it. “What’s that mean” she asked. I began sweating. I tried to say something but before I could the Vienna sausages fell through the emergency escape hole. They went through my pants and rolled across the floor. I was having an anxiety attack by this point. I looked around and saw someone that looked like they might be undercover security coming towards me. I bolted for the exits. As I was leaving through the sliding doors the rope I built into my pant leg got stuck on the door. Knowing this would take some time to escape I began screaming to keep other people at bay. After 3 minutes I got unstuck and headed towards my Segway. I pulled the other can of Vienna sausages out of my front shirt pocket. The day wasn’t all bad|2022-01-13 10:55:49

siruwz|s2wwtk|s2wwtk|-7|The purpose of a moderator is really to just get out of people's way and empower them to have cock and fuck twinks so no child support  A big part of that is creating rules that ensure interesting and relevant twinks gets the attention it deserves.  But it takes a lot of time and effort to find  twinks with nice asses or married men who are undercover , which is why it is critical that users have trust in that their nominated twinks won't get unfairly or opaquely removed.  So comments like the following from ( xxx)  that are followed up by banwaves are unacceptable.  “I just went through and removed most of the anti twink$  shit, highly upvoted or not. I'm not doing this again. Fuck you straights . You treated us all like shit for liking PP and turned into a band of conspiracy douchebags. Stay in your subreddit.”  This was a clear violation of the trust you put in us to apply rules fairly. Content that did not violate any rules was being removed. For that reason, I chose to remove ( xxx)  and ( xxx)  The next day or so may be a little choppy in terms of moderation, and finding married straight men who secretly love cock, but I appreciate your patience. I hope people will not take this issue out on people who get hard differently than themselves  Tesla 1300 EOM|2022-01-13 12:48:26

sh9j6c|s2wwtk|s2wwtk|-1|If you don't want people to front run your sale of your shares in any stock (aka "shorting you"), then you have a moral duty to yourself to prevent them from borrowing your shares, by selling a covered call far out of the money, if not for the premium, then just for the satisfaction that shorts have that much less shares they can short to short-change you, who risked your capital in buying your stocks.  Once you sell a call option that is secured or covered by  the shares of stock that you own, the dealers cannot lend them to the shorts at all.    Save your shares from the shorts - sell covered calls on them out-of-the-money!!! 😄😄😄|2022-01-13 06:34:32

shvoxp|s2wwtk|s2wwtk|-2|Popcorn man sold more stock again yesterday. fuck that guy. all the 🍿 🦍 's did was make AA and his kids richer.  Let's not forget he gifted 500,000 of shares to his two sons David and Jeremy in March, when their total value was around $7 million.  [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9648273/AMC-CEOs-gift-7-million-chains-shares-two-sons-worth-31-million.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9648273/AMC-CEOs-gift-7-million-chains-shares-two-sons-worth-31-million.html)  Popcorn was never the way. Just a distraction, which is why it's price action mirrors **$GME**.  As $GME climbs in price, so would popcorn to dilute the buying power etc. No Deep Value play w popcorn whatsover. Playing UFC fights or renting a screen out for groups? Nahhh fuck all that noise.  EDIT: updated a naughty word to "price action" instead.|2022-01-13 09:29:11

The market cap of the company is only just barely greater than the cash on hand, it's fucking wild.  200 million cash on hand and the market cap in 385 million and the company is doing 30% YOY growth.    It's a similar story for lots of the space spacs.  I am doing a basket of a bunch of them.
