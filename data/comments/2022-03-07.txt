Where the people don't want another war after how terrible the last one was, but the enemy keeps on pushing until there's a breaking point.   NATO is now looking to deploy more permanent detachments into the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) as some of the Nordic States (Finland and Sweden) begin to press for membership to the organization.

zprssm|t8mqyc|t8mqyc|3|So, I want to drop a quick note here because Amazon is getting pretty close to my Buy price target of 2,800. If you are buying stocks this would probably be a great entry. However, when buying options the current price action is terrible. When things drop off like this precipitously, it drives the internal volatility upwards, and this means that the options pricing is much higher than we'd like.  Right now, 3 week out options at the money are about $100 and that's twice what I would ordinarily pay for them on AMZN. So it looks like there's going to be a little bit more waiting on this one. The hope is that it starts to move sideways enough that the premium for at the money options comes down a lot. I'd like to get to $50, but for the most part it is important to remain flexible.|2022-03-07 09:54:39
