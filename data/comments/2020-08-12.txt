18wpcc|i8b56i|i8b56i|12|Took a sizeable position in gold and silver today. They fell off a cliff yesterday solely because the CME raised the margin requirements for Comex Futures 6.9% and 15.2%, respectively.  My theory was that the selloff was because traders needed to cut their position sizes to make the new margin requirement, which means the drop is temporary until people wire more money in.   Less of a future outlook on gold and silver and more of a temporary externality for new account requirements.   Future outlook remains unchanged. Inflation is definitely going up, the dollar is definitely going down and times are tough, so I see GLD and AGQ continuing their run for the time being üëçüèª|2020-08-12 14:27:24

If you stay up all night then you need to find makeup called ‚Äúconcealer‚Äù. Go to Sephora and ask them for concealer under your eyes. They will help find the right shade for you. It makes a difference. People are subconsciously turned off by bags under eyes.  EDIT: Here‚Äôs my $15 lapel mic [setup](https://i.imgur.com/YWlNDPw.jpg).

17z18g|i8b56i|i8b56i|4|I just realized.  The Tesla split is going to drive up the price heavily.   Not because it makes the shares split or because the shares are more affordable.   But because the OPTIONs will be more affordable.   The reason Tesla has cooled off as a meme stock is because there is no longer the Crazy moves due to insane prices on options and next earnings being a little ways off.   But after a split, options will SEEM more affordable.  This will drive another wave of heavy retail buying followed by another short squeeze inverse cascade into next earnings.

So why should the music stop at 3,300?  **I sense that investors want to touch the all-time high at 3,393 the same way a young child needs to touch stove to learn an important life lesson. Just no amount of lecturing from the adults in the room can prevent it from happening.**  To believe that the worst economic event in our lifetimes only resulted in a 3 week bear market when the average bear is 13 months long is absolutely fanciful and borderline insane. Aka‚Ä¶the markings of **a bubble.**  The main question at this time is WHEN is the bubble ready to burst. Again, I believe that is September/October because that is when I suspect that this modest bounce in economic data rolls over and goes quite negative once again. Plus that is when we will be faced with the unknowns of the Presidential Election which usually lops 5-10% off stock prices."|2020-08-12 13:49:10

I've sold everything and started from scratch twice now but I've just watched my BKYI shares drill this morning and it's sort of the last straw, I'm really not sure how to get together any kind of competent trading strategy now.

My wife said, "It's like all the Super Bowl t-shirts for the losing team that get thrown out." Exactly.

18qgmd|i8b56i|i8b56i|3|How to play earnings with your robinhood account and a spreadsheet.  &#x200B;  This is for people keep getting theta-cucked and holding through earnings...NOW, literally right now is the time to play the next earnings. It doesn't matter if the company beats earnings or not, the process is to find companies who run up before earnings.  &#x200B;  Before I proceed, i'm going to start by saying SELL BEFORE EARNINGS.     Step 1. Choose 10 stocks right now, i'll wait..... If you don't have 10 stocks, find them. Stop reading, look through this post here for 10 tickers. I don't care which tickers, just find them. I'll set a remind me for 3 months from today, we'll paper trade with this post right here to show you how it works. Doesn't matter if the stock beat recent earnings or not, preferably beat. The idea is to find stocks that beat and are currently lower than pre-earnings run up.  &#x200B;  Step 2. Now take those 10 stocks, look at:  \-Before recent earnings price  \-After earnings price, current price  &#x200B;  Find any whose current price is lower than the before earnings? Cool, it dropped because it's a stock that's succeptible to earnings hype. You found a good one! Well now people have sold out of it which means you're potentially at the lowest price it will be before the next earnings run up. Now of the remaining tickers, find options expiring the week of earnings or after and then buy near ITM options.  &#x200B;  Of my list, here are my plays:   Netflix, down 57 dollars a share (est next earnings October 17th)  Upwork, down 3 dollars a share (est next earnings November 4th)  ATVI, down 5 dollars a share (est next earnings November 5th)  &#x200B;  Options plays:  ATVI- 11/20 82.5c @ 6.50 per contract.  Netflix- 10/16 480c @ 33.95 per contract   Upwork- 10/16 12.5c @ 3.08 per contract. Went with October because there were no november or december options available.  &#x200B;  What we'll do is visit this on October 14th and November 18th and "sell" during the run up.|2020-08-12 13:40:54

1912on|i8b56i|i8b56i|4|Why is Gold falling right now? Easy, SPY is almost at ATH. Bulls and Bears are almost split 50/50 at this point.   One half expects SPY to break ATH and immediately go hyperbolic. Gold has historically ended its bull market, whenever SPY hits new ATH. So bulls are selling Gold.  Bears expect SPY to fall short of the ATH and start the next Leg down. The Fed has stopped to provide liquidity, so we would have another crash like in march. This would pull Gold down again. Thus Bears are selling.  There is no short term bull case for gold. Both Bulls and Bears agree, that it's better to sell right now.|2020-08-12 15:01:13

17v9yy|i8b56i|i8b56i|2|I don't want to sound like I am pumping a stock but Aston Martin is a really good buy even after the small run up it has had.right now it has a market cap of 1.3 billion, the brand name itself is worth more than that to a foreign company. Think a company like Nio is ever going to sell cars under the Nio name with all the China hate.    They have just released a very high performance SUV which is easily the hottest market right now, Lamborghini recorded record profits because of the Uras. The DBX factory is slated to make 4000 a year but I guarantee they will have to up production for demand|2020-08-12 09:45:08

18vtei|i8b56i|i8b56i|2|SRNE has dow-tick short protection again tomorrow (we had it today), the official rule below.  Would be a great time for them to finally fucking announce something real for the first time all month:  We note that if the price of a covered security declines intra-day by at least 10% on a day on which the security is already subject to the short sale price test restriction of Rule 201, the restriction will be retriggered and, therefore, will continue in effect for the remainder of that day and the following day. For example, if on Monday, the price of XYZ security declines intra-day by at least 10%, XYZ security will be subject to the alternative uptick rule for the remainder of Monday and for the following day, Tuesday. If then on Tuesday, the price of XYZ security again declines intra-day by at least 10%, the circuit breaker will be retriggered for that security such that the alternative uptick rule will apply for the following day, i.e., Wednesday, as well as for the remainder of the day on Tuesday.|2020-08-12 14:20:33

17ndlw|i8b56i|i8b56i|5|This is why im thinking Long on AAPL and TSLA post stock split. Hear me out.  I understand that the stock split changes ZERO about the companies value in terms of market cap, and only just increases shares outstanding.  HOWEVER, how many people actually realize this? When is comes to retail/robinhood investors im banking on the fact that these people will get excited to be able to afford full shares in these companies.  I'm sure that retail/robinhood investors NEVER look at the shares outstanding count on a company, the P/E ratio, or even benchmark the company they are investing in against its sector to see if the trading too high or low on a multiples basis.  Call me crazy, but with earnings releases, battery day, Apple Product conferences etc, I can easily see these type of investors flocking to purchase the stocks OR OPTIONS driving up the price overtime. I could even see these companies doubling their market cap on the pure basis that its new investors have no idea theyre doing so.  All in all, value isn't created with the stock splits, but for new investors its a psychological game. They believe they're getting a chance to invest in a huge company for cheap and in my opinion, will do so on a long basis.  And yes fractional shares do exist, but who wants to say they own .3453738489 shares of TSLA vs owning 10 shares? Again, psychological.|2020-08-12 08:32:36

WSB tech bulls will fomo in thinking they bought the dipbut its only down hill from there. They really haven't learned shit since getting IV crushed on earnings and wasting thousands on TSLA 2500c FD's Lol! The only ones making money off TSLA is thetagang, bears with long dated puts and MM's.   Were still in a pandemic, no is one buying luxury cars, Elon is a Joke with an ugly wife with a robot kid who will get bullied in school which is why he's being homeschooled til hes 21. Enough with the venting though, the play is easy for tendies.  TSLA Diagonal Put Debit Spread 1100/1200p - 900/1000p 9/4 - 10/16.   For the Yolo Bears, 1300p 8/14.

17xzhp|i8b56i|i8b56i|1|Since on SRNE we're just waiting for the company to respond to the hit piece and bullshit yesterday and do something to actually save lives / generate revenue, I'll talk about my other play: LULU.  It's not just a fucking meme.  This collection launched yesterday and already sold out most things in under 24 hours.  They're going to have it up for 2 weeks.  There's shit that was gone so fast it completely disappeared from the website within hours.  [https://shop.lululemon.com/search?Ntt=seawheeze](https://shop.lululemon.com/search?Ntt=seawheeze) .  After foot locker's good Q2 earnings, that speaks positively for LULU's Q2 earnings, which I was hesitant about because I wasn't sure if they would manage expectations of \~50% decrease year-over-year due to COVID.  Nonetheless, the warehouse sale plus this seawheeze drop plus the mirror acquisition revenue is going to give them an out-of-the park Q3.  *Current Position: Sept 300c*|2020-08-12 10:08:23

Which is strange because the ask was $7, so I went to check the option chain again and the ask was $5 for that strike.  What happened here? I thought the ask was the lowest price for the contract, how did I buy a contract that was asking for $7 and how did the ask become $5 afterwards?  I hope the question was clear.|2020-08-12 11:10:40

Silver (not SLV) price of 24 to 24.5) just keep that in mind.. but a successful bounce of 20 ema typically implies uptrend is not dead.. but if we break that level.. you need to bail.. it might have to go 21.5 to 22 to find next support at 50 day MA.|2020-08-12 09:23:27

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your account. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can trade anywhere, anytime, and I can make more than you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in technical analysis, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Investing.com futures prices and I will use them to their  full extent to wipe your miserable account off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

My question to all you folks is this. :With Kamila harras being the VP pick for Biden, How many of you expect pot/weed stocks to go up with this news?  She is a proponent of legalizing federally.   Thoughts?  Edit:    its a DAILY DISCUSSION thread...   All I'm doing is asking a general question... and all you full retards get triggered by someone who's trying to learn and asking a simple fukcing question....  Maybe instead of being total ASSHOLES to someone trying to learn, you could politely direct me toward the right place to ask my questions... instead of ALL of you fukcs getting so triggered by someone whos still new to this stuff...|2020-08-12 08:48:22
