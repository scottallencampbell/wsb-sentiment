dn0odb|em86ab|em86ab|41|dear daddy elon,  i started trading with 250 bucks last year when your stock was at $140. i worked a shit job in my major and i put $20 into my account every paycheck. since i'm completely an autist, i made 250 into 1k. 1k into 2k. 2k into 4k. and here we are a year later, 250 to 9k.   daddy elon: yesterday i did a dumb. when your daddy strong stock was going back and forth between 498 and 495, i bought my first Big Boy Call at 97.5. then the stock adjusted to 989. because, again i'm a fucking autist, i didn't lose the full 350. but that's the first time i've lost more than 115 in a day. i'm sure my fellow autists think that's a super cute statement but 250 to 9k is a rags to bitches story. my RH ain't red much.  daddy elon. please use your Strong Daddy powers. because every fucking cent this dipshit stock we're all riding the dick of goes up? i get like 12 bucks.   i've been a good boy this year and santa brought me new brakes for my car but my tires are bald. daddy elon, i don't want to die in a car crash. but the "black, round, holds air" option for tires starts at 350.   daddy elon. i have one late christmas wish. every day for almost the entire last 365 -- i've checked my account at 9:30 and you've sprayed thick wads of tendies all over me. sometimes i'm at work when you do it and it's super embarrassing but i'm still proud when i walk out for a smoke covered in your tendies. i made a Big Boy bet. just like you'd want me to: when i was financially stable enough to be able to take a 1k loss. and i am.   but daddy elon. i'm not going to take a 1k loss. and i want you to spray me so god damned hard in tendies that i can't fucking move.   also hey congrats on your bby. between you and grimes that kid is going to be emotionally detached as fuck but also rich af.  s p r a y m e d d y e l o n.|2020-01-09 06:40:27

But he said “it’ll take a little time” to finish an accord, and suggested he could have more leverage after his reelection bid in November.   “I think I might want to wait to finish ’til after the election, because by doing that, I think we can actually make a little bit better deal, maybe a lot better deal,” Trump told reporters at the White House. |2020-01-09 12:34:34

I helped him open a robinhood months ago and told him some vanguard index funds to buy when he has money saved (ik totally lame).   Yesterday we both happened to be visiting our grandmother at the same time so I asked how he was doing and the kid was balls deep in options.  He got the idea cause some kid at his school made 100k on tesla calls.|2020-01-09 07:51:45

dnp5yk|em86ab|em86ab|4|Honestly guYz, SPY could easily be up to $900 this year.  Just do a half a percent every day, which should be totally normal and easy, over like 200 trading days. I just ran the calculations.  Trump is gonna take care of it, I cant see the market going down for like any reason at all, even for a day.   Unfortunately my RH application only let's me buy $420 calls for Jan 15 2021 (that's as high as it goes), so I just called up my bank and took a second mortgage on my house. At only 18 cents per contract, theres no way I can lose money.|2020-01-09 11:17:58

dn6rmv|em86ab|em86ab|5|Hey guys just wanted to remind everyone I bought $170,000 of 3X Spy ETF in the depths of the great recession. I have enormous balls so I held for a decade. Unfortunately those balls hang out of my vagina. I have weak hands so I started to sell. I'm richer than you. Moving forward I have a series of hard stops in place that will engage the stretching of my vagina each time one is activated. I anticipate fitting three 8" cocks in my vagina by this time next year. And it doesn't make a difference when I sell because I make alot of money. And I don't mind giving 1/4 to this great nation. Pretty good payday if I say so myself. What does it feel like to pleasure a woman? My mom says she's proud of me but I feel like there's more to life than pleasing mother. Anyway guys, keep up the good work with those option things. When all of my hard stops are hit I plan to experiment with those things with all of my winnings.|2020-01-09 08:07:13

(who knows after ER tho)  same as BBBY, a chief merchant/coo officer took over a dying chain to see if they can keep the dream alive. the game is pretty simple, artisan looking and well designed private label should make the margin reasonable.  the problem is this: like BBBY, MIK's fucking demo is dying by the days and if they dont adapt to new demo and their diff needs, they are FUCKED. none of them sell anything that you couldn't get at AMZN.|2020-01-09 10:52:47

Sitting around 305 right now from which it already rebounded 3 times since the breakout of november. It also rebounded on that support back in April and got rejected a bunch of times in july and september so it seems like it's a good support  There's a gap left to 296.59 tho so it might visit that area first but that'd be another 2.5% downside. Next big volume area is 290 but again that's way too low point of entry for a technical move like that.

You’d be making a profit but If you have the funds available, wouldn’t you gain more if your ITM call executed and you immediately sold the shares?
