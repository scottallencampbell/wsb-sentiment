10e5rp|i751vc|i751vc|57|On some real shit though, everyday I get up early as shit to go to a job I can't stand, continuously, laid out for the majority of my life, like everyone else. I can't stand the thought of devoting my entire life, youth, hopes, and dreams to these billion dollar cooperations in exchange for 2 weeks of "vacation" and the hope to retire when im nearing death anyway. I think about it all the time and it really fucks with me, I feel like there is some timer out there that I have to beat or else my fate will be the same as my coworkers. I see all these people in the office who have given 30 years to one company, while every day complaining and hating their life. Who save up vacation time and never use a day, just to make their slimy bosses happy. Thats no way to live bros. This is our time, and we can make our fantasy a reality. We got this, so let's go out there Monday morning, open that fucking green feather logo of Robinhood and make some fucking trades bros. May the gift of tendies fall upon each of your bank accounts, and may your dreams come true. Godspeed WSB. Godspeed.|2020-08-10 12:06:06

Thanks for your patience with this.   You are currently designated as a professional trader based on having placed 390+ trades per day (on average) during a calendar month between April 2020 and June 2020.   At this time, Robinhood does not support professional traders, so your account will be set to Position Closing Only.  You still close positions, or transfer them out via the ACAT process.  We will be waiving the ACAT fee for if you choose to do so.    Please let me know if you have any follow up questions, and have a wonderful day.    Sincerely, Elliott|2020-08-10 08:47:23

It’s really easy to come in here and blow up a comment section pushing a meme stock or being a bear or bull. But when that poster inevitably Beirut’s their account, they just disappear with no notice.  So we have a constant cycle of fresh meat that hasn’t blown up their accounts yet screaming into the void about their particular stonk of choice. We don’t know their qualifications from Adam, we just know they don’t stop shilling it.   If you’re trying to pick a stock, you might be misled by all the voices and make a bad move based on all the confirmation bias.   Anyways, if I’m wrong about aapl I’ll admit it.

107fmk|i751vc|i751vc|49|#**LOL**  Does anyone remember that guy u/knicksAHgoat? That guy literally completely disappeared since about two months ago. He claimed DKNG was going to go to 70, and that he was "Never wrong before" and always pumped that shit, and shat on anyone who ever bought anything but DKNG.  In all reality, he was probably some 17 year old kid who got high off his own farts and loved to shove his fingers up his butthole while watching his life savings go up when he rode DKNG from 20 to 40. Then he called everyone retarded for two months saying he was a stock market prodigy, and then completely disappeared after it fell from 45 to 30 because he was probably balls deep in nothing but calls.  He literally called all of us retarded and said he was never wrong, saying it would go to 60, then 100..he must be quite sad, arrogance truly is blinding when everyone thinks they're Michael Burry🥺🥺🥺  **"TOLD YA RETARDS TO BUY DKNG.. look at that volume end of day. warrants expire next week it might go to 60$. Retards don't understand markets are forward-looking"** - u/knicksAHgoat  **"💯💯💯💯Still applies. I cant remember the last time I was wrong.

0zt4dy|i751vc|i751vc|30|I could get arrested for spilling this, but there's a secret department of the Fed that determines which assets to support. Many people believe that this department is simply a daycare for the children of Fed employees - but the truth is much more sinister.   See in this daycare, they have blocks with letters on them, and they let the infants arrange them as they wish. When a stock ticker is arranged through this process, the Fed proceeds to purchase and drive the stock price through the roof - it doesn't matter if it's a good company or anything, really.   Yesterday, one of the infants spelled out 'MGM'.|2020-08-10 09:06:30

But more than that they seemed broken, I could read the tears in their words, their lost hope, and I hate to admit, that I liked it.   Anyway, that's enough StockTwits for the next 6 months again, those guys have serious mental issues, and are beyond saving at this point.|2020-08-10 14:26:20

107mi0|i751vc|i751vc|6|So is aapl gonna plummet the week between record and split? 🤔 the faq on aapl investor relations says shares traded that week wont be eligible for the split. So why would anyone buy during that week? Also I am dumb  Edit: this is wrong I am wrong  "If you sell shares on or after the Record Date (August 24, 2020) but before the Ex Date (August 31, 2020) you will be selling them at the pre-split price. At the time of the sale, you will surrender your pre-split shares and will no longer be entitled to the split shares. Following the split, the new owner of the shares will be entitled to the additional shares resulting from the stock split. If you buy shares on or after the Record Date but before the Ex Date, you will purchase the shares at the pre-split price and will receive (or your brokerage account will be credited with) the shares purchased. Following the split, you will receive (or your brokerage account will be credited with) the additional shares resulting from the stock split."   https://investor.apple.com/faq/default.aspx|2020-08-10 11:12:50

0zxs94|i751vc|i751vc|5|The year is 2067, we live under the reign of JPOW II, the clone of the brave man who died with his finger on the print button to save the market. SPY is $3,015,412,478,972.05 a share, and my grandchildren are bitching they are "down" despite being up 123.5% from last year after some bad bets, instead of the market average of 124%. The market has been green every day since 2020.     I speak up. *“Oh, my sweet summer children, what do you know of down? Down is the dip that keeps on falling dozens of percentage points deep, and you can hear the squeals of pigs getting slaughtered across the entire globe. Down is the long redness, when the greens of any gains hide their sweet light from the market for months at a time. Little FDs are bought and fall and expire worthless all in the glowing red of the lines of the screen and even the Market Makers grow gaunt and have to switch to cheaper caviar as they evict millions from their foreclosed homes. In the down times, when the losses came, bears as big as houses swept through cities and accounts, shrieking "We told you downies would come every day for the last 13 years, tards!" while still sitting on cash even though it was worth less than toilet paper and the market had fallen scores of percentage points..."*     My grandchildren beat me with my own cane yelling, "fake news!" and laugh as I shit myself and I weep and wonder why I didn't abort their parents instead of buying puts.|2020-08-10 09:49:11

I've been swing trading since April and have proceeded to lose 50% of my portfolio (roughly 50k), during a time where stocks have basically only gone up.

Earlier, the two companies entered negotiations after United States President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the country unless it is bought by an American company by mid-September.  US media claimed that Microsoft is ready to pay $30 billion for the app and that a deal could be reached by the end of the month, but ByteDance denied the reports.|2020-08-10 12:17:36

Already a 4 bagger on my other SLV calls.  Grabbed a BABA call debit spread, 1/21 300/320, feeling good about earnings and this may be the last big dip before an earnings run up. On the fence if I would exit if it does run up a good amount or let it ride. Ready to double down if it dips below $240|2020-08-10 09:43:44

I'm seeing that QLYS's Q1 10q reported large revenue growth, but large operating profit & net income gains.  QLYS is also rated a buy by CFRA, who has been spot on with their analysis throughout the Covid market.  qlys is currently down \~6% on the day, but I think their stock price rises significantly at open tomorrow.

And TCO's court filing answer was pretty sketchy in response to it.  If SPG thinks it's bad enough to be worth including in the lawsuit, it's not good news, and the entire valuation of TCO is based on being acquired by SPG right now. Any bad news strengthens SPGs argument that TCO was uniquely affected so it's a double whammy, bad for being acquired and bad for the underlying company too.

You guys using RH are playing yourselves. I had a 0day SPY call I tried to sell in my real brokerage for .45 and it ended up actually executing at .57 - tell me when your RH app will give you that much more than you submitted the sell order for.

109i83|i751vc|i751vc|1|>	Well, it’s going to stop. CNBC’s Kate Rooney reports that “Robinhood says it will stop showing how many customers hold a certain stock on its website,” and will stop giving third parties (notably Robintrack) access to that data. Robintrack, an independent website that tracks which stocks are popular on Robinhood and how many holders they have, will not be able to do that anymore. Bloomberg News quotes Robintrack founder Casey Primozic:   >“They said the reason they’re doing this is because ‘other people’ are using it in ways they can’t monitor/control and potentially at the expense of their users,” he wrote in a message to Bloomberg News. “They feel it paints Robinhood as being full of day traders when they say most of their users are ‘buy and hold.”’  Lmao, buy and hold for a day maybe.|2020-08-10 11:28:12

10dhog|i751vc|i751vc|1|Can someone explain something to me?  Reading about HFTs & electronic front running. One thing Im trying to understand: I totally get how HFT front runs investors who want to buy large blocks of stocks. They see the order coming, race to the other exchanges, buy up all the stock & then turn around & sell them to said investor for a slight increase in price, pocketing the small difference.  But what about sell orders? If they see a large sell order coming, how do they front run? I could see how if they have some of that stock in their possession, they could sell immediately to whatever market demand there is & turn around & buy back from the investor at a lower price they sold, pocketing a small difference. But as I understand it, HFTs dont hold onto stocks for long at all.  So how do they front run sell orders? Thanks for any education on this.|2020-08-10 12:00:36
