So many idiots did stupid crap like take out HELOCs to buy $50-60k cars, take vacations, do cosmetic crap to their homes etc. They could get absolutely torched as their property values fall and their payments explode because interest rates are going up.

mot7hi|x33kn7|x33kn7|6|You all got spoiled.  Mostly 5-7% annual return is great.  But then gme happened, others followed.  And people thought that was the norm, everything was gonna moon, lambo, retire blah blah.  Nope.  Most people end up broke or holding backs.  When you pick a stock set a goal and stick to it.  If it keeps going up after you sold oh well, but when it goes back down after you sold thats a great feeling.  Either way if you set your goal and stick to it you made money.  Which is way better than losing money, or holding bags long term and staring at red for months.  I learned my lesson|2022-09-01 12:57:30

IF this happened today the median priced $400,000 house with a 20% $80,000 down would cost you over $5,400 a month in payments for a 30 year loan.  In just 7 years you will pay more in interest than the house is worth! ($415,000 just interest)  By the year 15 you will pay **$878,928** in just interest on a $400k house.

If you charged more for swallowing ($30 a dick) and could swallow about 12 loads a day, and suck an additional 16 dicks to lower your overall dick intake by 6 dicks a day, and while I've never sucked a dick I am pretty sure 6 less dicks a day would be worth the dozen loads, which would actually negate the need for packing a lunch and save you more money there too.|2022-09-01 10:24:49

Ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake in Sept., therefore no one will need NVDA cards to mine and there could be a flood of cards hitting the market. Retailers were also anecdotally reporting inventory gluts of NVDA cards and had to offer price cuts to get rid of them.  The first thing that will get cut during a recession/leaner times will be spending on the cloud.  Also, AMDs new RDNA3 products will have superior performance per watt advantage compared to NVDA products. It's the same kind of advantage that allowed AMD to kick INTC's ass with its Rome server processor. NVDA is gonna have it rough.   Regardless of the nerd shit, NVDA is simply over fucking valued with a super stretched PE. It could seriously go to $80-100 before P/E makes sense.|2022-09-01 10:52:55

mnn4it|x33kn7|x33kn7|2|The ISM Manufacturing PMI edged lower to 52.8 in July of 2022 from 53 in June, beating market forecasts of 52. The reading pointed to a 26th straight month of rising factory activity but the weakest rate since June of 2020, as new order rates continue to contract although supplier deliveries improved and prices softened to levels not seen in two years. New orders (48 vs 49.2) and employment (49.9 vs 47.3) declined and production (53.5 vs 54.9) and supplier deliveries slowed (55.2 vs 57.3) while inventories rose faster (57.3 vs 56) and price pressures softened (60 vs 78.5). Meanwhile, sentiment remained optimistic regarding demand, with six positive growth comments for every cautious comment. Firms are now expressing concern about a softening in the economy, amid developing anxiety about excess inventory in the supply chain.|2022-09-01 08:20:49

mq477e|x33kn7|x33kn7|5|Hot take:  The best way to get a read on sentiment is to post a macro hot take and see how many downvotes it gets relative to other macro takes.   Example: inflation cooling rapidly. Idiots here shilling 30% inflation Weimar Republic with another 1000 points to go shit a month ago and earlier. Now look at you. Dick in one hand thumb up the butt with the other.   Supply chains: fucked forever. Retailers saying consumers can expect a decline in prices this holiday season.   Recession: labor market has regarded strength. My neighbors fucking maid just bought a new accord in cash.  Claims down. Continuing claims down. Consumer? Regardedly strong.   No buyers: there be buyers. We bears got cucked today.   Gas prices: was it 10 bucks by thanksgiving holiday? I dunno.   Ww3: yea right  Dollar devaluing: for what???  My point is this: everyone you listen to on the news, by the water cooler, and here is an idiot. Including me. We are all guessing. It just so happens that the majority of you here are especially regarded and detached from reality.    Make your own choices.  Don’t always inverse wsb because the money here is paltry but within a 3 week or 5 week channel it can work out fine.   And most of all have fun!|2022-09-01 18:04:30

Amazon can offer its private label products at a far lower cost, and these products are eating away at the business of national brands in textiles and at Bed Bath and Beyond. The trend is your friend. BBBY will never be able to compete in e commerce with Amazon, and the shift back towards national brands will not work. It is too late.

mnl4xo|x33kn7|x33kn7|2|I keep hearing about how GME squeezed and BBBY can do the same. Not a comparable situation. First, the squeeze happened when the entire stock market was valuing companies with no earnings based on a negative real cost of capital. More importantly it was a Bull market where the Fed was buying every asset in sight. Now the situation has reversed, the Fed is selling every asset, and we are in a Bear market and money losing companies have been hammered. Sure Gamestop has raised a ton of cash at equity prices that were 50x higher than its low. Still, it burned over $200 million in the last quarter, and its cash will last until the end of next year at best. There will be a day of reckoning for all of these stocks unless redditors keep feeding these money losing pigs. Ryan Cohen will not save it. You can bet your ass the day will come when he will post his 13D with some high priced calls and liquidate his stock in short order.|2022-09-01 08:05:42

People are losing a metric fuck ton of money they cant afford to lose because they’re listening to all these people hoping to be enticing enough to get people to keep buying. These delusional “DD”  and “BBBY will blow up.. here’s why” posts are actually crazy cause it’s so apparent people are coping w losses and hoping for a play that won’t happen.

mngyim|x33kn7|x33kn7|0|BBBY has declining revenue and a relatively fixed cost structure yet it has a new plan to reduce the number of stores and cut labor so that it can solve its debt problem. Since when does shrinking your business while migrating towards lower margin national brands solve a debt problem? It will never fucking work.   Everybody says the valuation of BBBY is $900 million. Complete BS. This conveniently ignores $5 billion of debt plus $500 million in additional debt (despite the friendlier "financing" term,) that is tacked on putting the same money losing business further in the hole.. If BBBY was debt free it would might have a $900 million valuation. I doubt it though. The company has no business. Businesses are supposed to make money. A company that is bleeding money at a clip of $100 million a month is not a business. BBBY has 6 months to solve its problems. Does anyone really think it will turn a profit in 6 months?|2022-09-01 07:32:10

Currency crises also demolished the Thai baht in 1997 that led to the whole Asian Financial crisis, and it blew up Long Term Capital Management that required congress to stop it from blowing up the entire US economy.    Look at the USD now. Destroying the euro, pound, yen,.....Yen trading at 24 year lows.

I’ve never seen so many posts worried about strangers’ investments and at the same time posts from “regards” who accurately describe what fundamentals to look for but purposefully getting them wrong to portray BBBY as some great turnaround plan (it’s not).   I hold 0 positions currently but honestly seeing this shit play out makes me want to open a small position.. doesn’t seem like it’s over yet.

mo3dnn|x33kn7|x33kn7|2|Paid shills are causing meme exit vs ordinary investors selling shit show companies like BBBY  When company is bleeding money, has $5 billion of debt, added $500 million more but its losing $100 million per month in an economy where things are getting worse.  Sorry dude Fed needs to halt economy to stop inflation.  Newsflash:  the monthly payment on a $500k mortgage went up 40% in last 8 months.  Reversing a 26% sales decline isn't happening.  And the decline is not just this year, its a 4 year trend. Reversing the shift to Amazon isn't happening in 5 months. The companys debt trades at 20 cents on the dollar, which means 99% it isnt repaid.  Yet This is time to trigger a short squeeze? fuck people are dumb as shit.  Meme stocks going to  zero. Period.

moj29h|x33kn7|x33kn7|-4|So maybe I'm an idiot, but GBTC is trading at a discount to its NAV while MSTR is trading at a surplus. MSTR has to service its loan and may soon have to increase the BTC silvergate holds as collateral. MSTR can only cover the principal by either taking out a new loan or selling its BTC. A new loan would be at a dramatically higher interest rate and if it sells its BTC, it will be a huge realized loss, a decrease in total available collateral (for its credit worthiness) and a dramatic reduction in the assets its trading at a premium to. Unless BTC has a stark reversal and soon, isn't the business kind of fucked? Doesn't the new CEO have a responsibility as a fiduciary to sell BTC before it drops more to preserve the company and won't doing so completely kill the value proposition? I know I've been bearish on MSTR for a long time (I was bullish last August and have been a bear since October), so maybe I have blinders on, but the company seems fucked unless there's a Fed pivot.     Were I CEO, I'd be trying to renegotiate some of my (underwater) liabilities and divest my depreciating assets. But I'm just some WSB regard who's not being sued for tax evasion by the DC AG|2022-09-01 11:52:57

mop7bl|x33kn7|x33kn7|-5|Wow. They did it again. You know for a bunch of people who mock “this time is different” to say it’s always the same, you’re always awfully sure “this is it! This is the big one! This time it’s different!” And then bam. Outta nowhere they hit you with a 30 point rally in a matter of minutes. Vix falls more than usual.  It’s abuse. Anything dated tomorrow and Tuesday now in the danger zone if not already down 50% + if you purchased 1dte today.   When bulls win: insane massive rallies back to back where even the dumbest trades pay out.   Bear wins: slow couple dollar chops and volatility crushes to devalue anything that isn’t ATM from the top gaining on 1.00 delta as we approach expiration so even if you’re right, unless it’s absolutely perfectly built, you’re fucked.   Believe it or not I’m up on the day but holy shit the cuckening and bear hatred is real. Also, admittedly the put trade is massively overcrowded but nonetheless it’s wack.|2022-09-01 12:32:07

Many assumptions but it just seems too good to pass up.  1) USA gearing up for war.  2) NVDA needs chip buyers and specializes in ML chips.  3) AMD needs chip buyers and has FPGAs for missile guidance.  What do these three have in common? DRONES.  How can I bet the US military is going to place massive drone orders in 2023? Also I think AMD will get the better deal here - you buy one chip for drone control, but you have to buy a new FPGA every time your missile blows up.|2022-09-01 06:52:10
