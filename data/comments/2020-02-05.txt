gm28ek|ez7z3h|ez7z3h|6|The bear market will not come simply because something happened in the news to make stonks go down. Clearly that can only hold for a couple days in the midst of euphoria, because everyone knows by now that stonks only go up to ATH every week. So any dip is just seen as a buy. For bears to win, really win in 2020, we must do the seemingly impossible. We must convince the bulls that stonks *DO* go down, and that there is no more up to be had. Crazy I know.      [https://www.cnbc.com/market-strategist-survey-cnbc/](https://www.cnbc.com/market-strategist-survey-cnbc/)  Look at these year end targets for 2020. Most banks are predicting we will end the *entire calendar year* at about 3300 or 3400. If you believe these predictions, there isn't much upside left but there are tendies to be made on the downside.     The fundamentals actually look good on the surface. EPS & revenue meeting or exceeding estimates. Revenue doesn't have to actually go up Y/Y, because with buybacks you've got investors who have become comfortable with higher valuations when compared to last year. SPY had a PE ratio of \~19.6 last year, now I'm seeing estimates closer to 25. People don't seem to care though. If we went full 1999 on this bull market, we would see a ratio of 30+ on the index before a crash. GDP growth is still above 2% (based on initial estimate). Unemployment rate seems to have reached and maintains a bottom plateau at 3.5%.     Under the surface I think there is plenty to worry about. I think the biggest problem is that we're only able to hold 2% GDP by using: Big corporate tax cuts, $1 trillion/year deficit, interest rates cut down to 1.5% (unprecedented during a bull market), huge and continuing repo operations of $60+ billion a week, and QE4 purchases in the amount of \~$40 billion a month. Without all these measures combined working to stave off a recession, we would already be in a bear market (see Dec 2018 for an example of how things would still be going if the Fed hadn't stepped in). And because the bull market has been artificially lengthened in such a way, it will make the inevitable bear market all the more painful. All the measures that would normally be used to ease the pain of a recession, are already used up. Wsb trades weekly options mostly, so we have the luxury of not needing to think about the future, but I think the next recession is going to be a doozy.

gltar1|ez7z3h|ez7z3h|4|Theta Gang, let's say you sold puts and nailed it.  You sold the put, the stock mooned and now your put has almost no value.  But it doesn't expire for another 3-4 weeks.  At what point do you just close the position so you can move onto something else?  I mean, there has to be value to reducing your risk when the position closes and there's only so much stock you can on the hook to buy.   Do you always just let it expire?  Though I guess "nailing it" would mean buying calls on the stock but whatever... gains are gains.  EDIT:  Thank you for actually answering my question.  Sometimes it's hard to get real answers here so I really appreciate it.|2020-02-05 07:46:59

Lithium mining is an interesting way to play the EV hype, sans TSLA‚Äôs insane volatility and IV.   I got into 4/17Cs a couple weeks ago, and it‚Äôs been good to me. If it steps down to 29 (50 day EMA) and bounces, that might be good spot to buy...  At this level, I‚Äôd look at going slightly farther OTM.  Happy trading folks, let‚Äôs get it!|2020-02-05 10:37:53

Say what you will about the Chinese leadership, they do take a long term view and I have no doubt that the New Year holiday will be extended again and again.

gmywc1|ez7z3h|ez7z3h|5|Dear Autist community,  Corona will strike back! This isn't contained at all. Go to r/Coronavirus to see the harsh truth. Even, mid-aged, healthy people suddenly die. Crematoriums are burning around the clock. The official numbers are simply bullshit.  Today there were more infections than ever before. My educated guess is, that Chinese economy will tank way more due to quarantine efforts until at least April. There's no opening in sight for Macau gambling, too. My play is buying YANG and shorting WYNN or LAS.  A Cruise ship is now under quarantine, too. 270 possible cases are being tested right now. One third of the 30 tested have the virus. ONE person managed to infect them all.  This will cause massive uncertainty. Tons of people will abort their cruises. My play is shorting CCL, NCLH or RCL.|2020-02-05 14:29:36

gmrw7o|ez7z3h|ez7z3h|-12|Curious about options. I always see screenshots here of crazy losses and gains and .. well, I wanna be an Autist like you guys <3      All I basically know is that puts are short sales and calls are longs, essentially. Can someone help point me in an informative direction on options? I use Robinhood and I'm really only using a small demo account but I'd like to give options a shot SOMEDAY once I feel a little more confident in my abilities and have more than $30 in my account.      An eli5 friendly site, FAQ, or whatever would be extremely helpful. Anyone got any dumbass friendly links? Don't see myself being able to easily learn it on my own.      PS- From an amateur's perspective, buy ACB and CHK. My bags are heavy. üòÇüòÇ|2020-02-05 13:26:40
