Mean while Italy tested multiple 1000 people, everybody with fever in the North and even asymptomatic cases. Their economy took the hit now (short term) but they are transparent and ultimately that will help with the recovery.

I was having dinner at his house a couple of weeks ago and I asked him about the virus and what he thought was important to keep in mind. This is what he said:  The stat to look at, and what anyone at the CDC will be paying special attention to is how many hospital workers get infected because this will show how contagious this thing really is. That probably the most important stat someone in the medical field says to look at.  Now in the UK 8 minutes ago a GP, a doctor, was diagnosed with Corona. Here is a quote:  "The GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week before he became ill in the last 24 hours."  Shit is bad boys. Shit is bad.

j0c3s6|fat4io|fat4io|23|// Kings. //   Today is the day. Bears, Bulls, Brothers. Futures red. Futures green. It is no matter. This week, the market you knew as Free Tendie Machine turned on you. Turned on us. And through the bitter fights we fought this week, we came to know our enemy. We came to know its weaknesses. We warned the brothers we fought beside, "King, that is a trap."   And here we stand. The Friday we will know and remember as, "That one Friday before financials started coming out for countries on Monday and it was kind of trash for everyone." This market? This market does not want to hold over the weekend. This market wants you to be the holder of an empty bag -- puts, calls alike -- while they make fools of you. Fools of your meticulously and austimally crafted portfolio, delicately shaped with a pair of tiny scissors in the shape of a penis.  Kings. Today is the day. Today is the day we become fellow Kings together. Gay Bears standing side by side with Number Go Up Bulls. Look your fellow King in the eye and say, "King, this literally can't go tits up."  Tonight we dine on tendies in Wendy's in hell.  ... ah shit. I'm sorry, uh. I was on a tangent. Yes. A number three. Can I uh, get an extra honey mustard with that. I'm aware it's an extra $0.25, that isn't an issue. And a Biggie Frosty, please. Broken? man. uh. Mellow Yellow with no ice then. Yes, I'd still like it to be a Biggie. Thank you.|2020-02-28 07:22:14

j0ykiy|fat4io|fat4io|9|Thoughts on HF algos:   They utilize machine learning algorithms that could be (and are likely) overfit to a bullish market. This means that small rallys on the daily after large selloffs are picked up by algos as "gap closing" movements. This spurs a buying rally and shows these short term bull rallys across the daily bear trend. This is just a theory, but it could indicate that markets are really much more bearish than meets the eye.|2020-02-28 11:11:05

j1374f|fat4io|fat4io|7|Stopped trading options after loosing my ass in 2008 but let me dust off some TA and see how it goes:  Looking at SPY 5min candles you can see that 285 was strongly rejected followed by a weak Rejection at 295 and now we have settled into an inverted triangle with support at 293.30. With low volume. This looks like it‚Äôs going to break up or down in the next couple of periods.   By 1 pm I bet we‚Äôre back in full down swing.  Edit: my guess is it‚Äôs going to go back and touch 285 again before closing a little above that.  Edit: At 1pm it crossed 293.50 and went up to 295 the level of this mornings weak rejection.  And now you know why I don't trade options on technical analysis.|2020-02-28 11:50:03

Airlines and cruise stocks are bumping along the bottom the past 2 days after collapsing 45% while the rest of the market has caught up to them by falling 6-8%.  The update is that coronavirus "hype" stocks like APT, CODX, LAKE, and the rest have all experienced massive boom-busts over the past 2 days as the coronavirus talk overheated which shows that these things got way ahead of themselves and then rapidly corrected.  That should be a good sign that things can't get much worse from here absent actual coronavirus outbreaks in the US.|2020-02-28 12:17:25

j1ctnx|fat4io|fat4io|20|Imagine making 400-500% or more this week and then holding puts over the weekend.. if you‚Äôre new here (which you are, don‚Äôt fucking lie), be smart. Sell at least half EOD. Markets too volatile you could easily never realize those gains if there‚Äôs a gap up Monday + IV crush + theta. Yes it‚Äôll probably keep going down but there‚Äôs always another opportunity and you can just buy back in next week. If you sell and it does go down, you‚Äôll only be missing the gap down if you rebuy Monday morning. Which is nbd bc at some point it‚Äôll bounce and you can get back in cheaply.

Every time a pump fails it looks even worse for people and this looks like it is about to fail.   Also FYI what would have really been good is if he said that the economy looked like shit. He is not going to cut rates unless the economy looks bad. Ya of course they will continue repo but I do not believe what he said suggested that he is seriously thinking about cutting interest rates cause of the flu.   that's also why I think this week has been so bad. it's the market throwing a tantrum so corporate America can secure lower interest rates.|2020-02-28 14:00:39

j0wvww|fat4io|fat4io|19|Alright boys, I am about to go play basketball. But let me leave this here. I am friends with a former director of the CDC. Can't say names cause ya whatever. I was having dinner at his house a couple of weeks ago and I asked him about the virus and what he thought was important to keep in mind. This is what he said:   The stat to look at, and what anyone at the CDC will be paying special attention to is how many hospital workers get infected because this will show how contagious this thing really is. That probably the most important stat someone in the medical field says to look at.   Now in the UK 8 minutes ago a GP, a doctor, was diagnosed with Corona. Here is a quote:   "The GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week before he became ill in the last 24 hours."   Shit is bad boys. Shit is bad.

Yeah I know we had a large correction in late 2018, but most of the time it always felt like market had this innate trust that things would work out with respect to the trade war, interest rates, etc.  Like the market could just force the Fed to take action or whatever was needed.  The market is just panicking right now because there's nothing Trump or the Fed can do or say about a supply-side shock emanating from China.  I still think this is a huge overreaction and a part of this downward move will rapidly rewind upwards, but it's just worth noting that this is the first real market panic in the Trump era.|2020-02-28 08:31:02

That is not the case on a forward P/E basis. Setting aside the question of whether 2020 EPS forecasts are remotely close to accurate given the uncertainty, the simple fact of the matter is that at 16.7x as of last night‚Äôs close, the S&P 500‚Äôs P/E is above the average of 15.1x during this bull market (measured excluding the dramatic drop and rebound in early 2009). If you want an example of a screaming buy during a growth scare, look to 2011. The P/E was in the low 10s then. Even in December 2018‚Äôs elevator ride down, the forward P/E sank to 13.6x. So even before earnings get updated, there‚Äôs more downside on a valuation basis until stocks become too cheap to ignore. The counterpoint is that interest rates are resetting lower and will remain low for months to come, and that argues for a richer equity valuation than in the past. But that rests on the critical debate we‚Äôre all having now: will normalcy return sooner rather than later. If it doesn‚Äôt, what are stocks worth and are you being compensated for that uncertainty?|2020-02-28 06:17:06

Asian dudes, if you can believe it. Results on said dudes should come around April, but the media will HYPE THE FUCK OUT of any positive news that leaks.  Rest of the companies working on something for Heinekenvirus aren't gonna have shit for like a year, as GILD got a massive headstart by already having safety trials done a few years ago.   I'm thinking you might wanna look into the following:  90~100c a month or two or three out, depending on how big your wallet is.

The market is going to consolidate and make plans to move money around accordingly. This weekend will be a bunch of meetings on Wall Street to formulate or enact a black swan/rogue wave event like COVID-19. We are coming off the tail end of Q4 for a lot of companies that killed it during holiday. Fresh revenue isn‚Äôt going to be flowing into a lot of different sectors.  Normally, without beer virus, this would be a slow building up, with ATH being achieved monthly. In this case, the allure of taking profit and rearranging it until equities are dirt cheap again might be enough to cause MM to capitulate and sell this shit for now.|2020-02-28 14:32:44

In this article, they say that labs can expect to start doling out results mid-next week.

Don't care if I miss a day when markets shoot up, but I'd rather miss out on a bit of money than fall for a bull trap and lose everything.  Just my two cents.  Right now I'm sitting happily on my puts and probably gonna take profits and maybe sit out for a bit.  Right now the market is really unpredictable.  Probably going to sell premium to take advantage of this super high IV and that's about it.  Good luck to all and remember not to get greedy whether the market is going up or down.  Profit is profit.

My thought process is that at some point the market is gonna come back up, either naturally or through a rather large injection. On one hand it would drive up IV (I think), but on the other hand the market may have a ways to go down, so I think it could be worth having some more cash on hand to buy into the bull trap.  Thoughts? Ideally I'd like to reinvest my profits into new, more profitable positions.

I was having dinner at his house a couple of weeks ago and I asked him about the virus and what he thought was important to keep in mind. This is what he said:  The stat to look at, and what anyone at the CDC will be paying special attention to is how many hospital workers get infected because this will show how contagious this thing really is. That probably the most important stat someone in the medical field says to look at.  Now in the UK 8 minutes ago a GP, a doctor, was diagnosed with Corona. Here is a quote:  "The GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week before he became ill in the last 24 hours."  Shit is bad boys. Shit is bad.

Regardless, fear is at an all time high and a vaccine could take 12 to 18 months so this shit I think it‚Äôs gonna explode like people are going to get sick and the markets are going to drop  Regardless I bought 100 10p Nov exp on the VIX for 1k, so if it does drop now it prints, if not and it keeps going up (like I think) I‚Äôll re up and buy more  Just liquidated most of my mutual fund, waiting for the next bull run.

Fuck your Econ 201 supply shock talk. There is 0 chance the Fed doesn‚Äôt act on this. Period. Full stop. They will act first and justify it with theory later. They have been incredibly sensitive to market corrections in the past, now there is the steepest one in history and something lurking underneath the surface with bank liquidity suggesting a potential systemic event. And you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll act?  Whether it is a rate cut, not-QE666, hedge fund bailouts or whatever they are going to prop this however they can.

j0trc0|fat4io|fat4io|3|Here's my thoughts on this. Long term (over the next month) I think we go down more. But we could see a short term rise in markets, simply because a lot of people with cash are going to think this is a good buying opportunity. I might not agree with them, but that's what they're thinking. This could be enough to balance out the selling pressure at least until we get an outbreak in the US and have to quarantine a city or state. That's when we could see another 10-15% drop.|2020-02-28 10:32:51

They've been flat since yesterday's market open while the rest of the market fell 5-6% to catch up.  That to me is a critical signal that most of the market adjustment to coronavirus is done unless another shoe drops (i.e. big outbreak in California or re-worsening in China or something of that nature).|2020-02-28 08:45:20

j0z4hx|fat4io|fat4io|2|>   >   >[**Stocks Likely to Bounce Next Week, Unless...**](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/Q6F95EDWX2PW)   >   >(Bloomberg) -- The stock market has bounced off the worst of today‚Äôs declines with the canary semiconductor sector turning green. Perhaps the markets are oversold enough to turn around? By my count, only 20% of the S&P 500 members are still hanging above their 200-DMA. It‚Äôs a rare occurrence, and history suggests a bounce next week is likely, as colleague Andy noted earlier. Using the TSIG function, there‚Äôs been 28 cases since 1995 when so many stocks are trading below their moving average. The S&P 500 rose in the next five days for 21 times with an average gain of 3.3%. All the seven losses came during the 2008 recession and in 2002 following the burst of the tech bubble. Violent bounces in a market correction are not unheard of. Whether it‚Äôs a dead cat bounce is another question. As long as the virus continues to rapidly spreads across the world, equities may lean towards pessimism.|2020-02-28 11:15:34

j1oho0|fat4io|fat4io|2|   To be fair GS was saying 0% growth in 2020 and they may lower it to negative. CNBC Bloomberg all analysts were saying recession inevitable. Fibonacci articles saying it busted through 38% and headed to 50% no support. Then they all flipped. The actual news and reality don't matter. They should've known from the overvaluations.  Listen, I use a TTM indicator. Literally every time it was about to bust out yesterday news was released and it tanked it even more. The timing was PERFECT.  Today every time we got a leg up it was in the middle of a bad signal and inconsistent with the indicator. The news didn't drop in timing with the indicator. There was consolidation all day at 289.  BUT when you are caught up in the emotion of greed or fear all of this stuff escapes you. Trust me, I was blinded Thursday and had to keep adding funds from then until yesterday in order to average down. I got out at open today at breakeven from yesterday. Overall I'm down from Thursday but I'll fully recover and make tendies until my expiry.  I have 4/17 325s at .90cb . They are at 1.38 now.|2020-02-28 15:12:19

Sell for a loss bc if you sold Monday, the present value of that dollar now is worth more than potential gains or B/E whenever that pop comes, and if you wen short could easily make that money back from selling for a loss and getting back to where you were before than to hold onto losers forever.

We‚Äôre so oversold that even something like this could cause a massive bounce.  Covid-19 is not the flu as you mentioned. I realize it is from a completely different family of viruses, with its own resulting fatality rates etc, but we can probably assume that it spreads like other corona and influenza viruses where the more aware potential hosts are and the less hospitable the environment, the fewer the number of cases we will have.  The market may also take into account how mild the illness is for the majority of patients especially when it has priced in an apocalyptic scenario.|2020-02-28 16:22:04

j0vmj3|fat4io|fat4io|1|Alright boys, I am about to go play basketball. But let me leave this here. I am friends with a former director of the CDC. Can't say names cause ya whatever. I was having dinner at his house a couple of weeks ago and I asked him about the virus and what he thought was important to keep in mind. This is what he said:  The stat to look at, and what anyone at the CDC will be paying special attention to is how many hospital workers get infected because this will show how contagious this thing really is. That probably the most important stat someone in the medical field says to look at.  Now in the UK 8 minutes ago a GP, a doctor, was diagnosed with Corona. Here is a quote:  "The GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week before he became ill in the last 24 hours."  Shit is bad boys. Shit is bad. Cases are gonna sky rocket and with the FED still playing tight lipped about rate cuts, this ship is gonna go down.|2020-02-28 10:48:02

I got really lucky to get my 304 put when SPY was at 306, obviously went well, MSFT looks great too.  Hold or sell?
