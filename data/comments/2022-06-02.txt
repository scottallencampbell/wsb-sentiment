axuw2e|v35d7a|v35d7a|4|In economic reports, payroll services firm ADP estimated a gain of 128,000 jobs in May. That's well below the Econoday consensus estimate of 240,000 and below the prior month's increase of 202,000.  The ADP report could foreshadow Friday's Labor Department report on May employment growth. The Econoday consensus estimate of nonfarm payrolls is an increase of 325,000 with an unemployment rate of 3.5%. The May job numbers are expected to drop from April's 428,000 increase.  In another labor market report, jobless claims fell to 200,000 from a revised 211,000 the previous week. Economists polled by Econoday had forecast 210,000 first-time claims.|2022-06-02 13:14:48

Unprofitable companies are delisted very quickly.   In 1970's companies remained in S&P500 on average for 30 years by 1990s it was down to 20 years and now its closer to 10 years on average.   Over the past decade, **50%** of the S&P 500 has been replaced. If the trend continues, approximately **75%** of companies on the index will be replaced by 2027. Unprofitable companies are delisted fast and are replaced with good profitable companies that work in the current economy! SPY does not baghold unprofitable garbage like Cathie Woods does.

Just like that? We need more supply, and now these clowns are increasing borrowing costs for businesses, including energy, food, etc firms? They are setting us for stagflation by rocking markets and fucking up inflation expectations, this kind of circus situation is what leads to stagflation, and they know it. It's something to have higher than avg inflation while the economy grows and deals with supply challenges, and it's something else to kill growth before we even begin to tackle supply issues.

axnzoc|v35d7a|v35d7a|3|So, I am all for what happened with GME originally, thought it was awesome that the market makers lost a battle. But after being here for a little bit, I feel that I should contribute something..  If you don't see the writing on the wall from inflation, here are my thoughts.As people are forced to spend more of their income on inelastic goods (rent, gas, food, etc...) They have less disposable income.People are the ones who buy stuff, and with less disposable income, it affects consumer discretionary income, and they buy less stuff from companies.   Companies are experiencing negative effects from inflation, which include higher labor costs, higher raw material costs, etc.. So at the same time people are buying less stuff, these companies are having to raise prices to continue to make a profit or break even. Companies also have fixed costs, and sales have to meet an economy of scale, or prices have to go up exponentially to cover these fixed costs (building, insurance, etc..)  To top it off, this cycle feeds off of itself, and the Fed has limited tools to use to fight inflation. The tools that they do have are going to be ineffective because they are caught between crashing our economy through action (increasing rates and causing the markets to collapse) and crashing our economy through action (holding even, or decreasing interest rates) which feeds the inflation engine as described above.   As a side note, I have included a link to a graph of what our government has done to our currency. M1 Money supply is the measure of all dollars in circulation. Scarcity drives value.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL)  So, no need to pretend to be a bull or a bear, you can just look at the meme's on WSB about people under $250,000/yr living paycheck to paycheck and rectify that with what happens to companies when everyone isn't a consumer whore, and wages aren't keeping up with the cost of living.|2022-06-02 12:26:39

axta0t|v35d7a|v35d7a|1|let me explain QE and QT: Ok so the Fed goes to a dealer and buys from him the securities. It doesn't go to the issuing entity, but to a dealer, this is important. Yes, they buy these securities, but it is more of a swap since the Fed doesn't pay with money, but with bank reserves. So the securities go into the Fed's balance sheet, and the reserves go into the dealer's balance sheet. Ok so what happened? Assets at the Fed increased, clearly, but also liabilities increased since bank reserves are a liability of the Fed, on which it has to pay interest to banks (like bank deposits for us at commercial banks). Ok so what happens when the securities mature? Well the Fed gets the money back, i.e. cash, but that doesn't affect the balance sheet. The unwinding of the balance sheet happens when the Fed pays back its liabilities to the dealers with the cash they just made. How does this happen? The Fed swaps back the bank reserves with their value in cash, effectively reducing its balance sheet. Now the dealer has cash instead of bank reserves. Guess what they'll do? Buyback similar securities, possibly on the cheap.|2022-06-02 13:03:18
