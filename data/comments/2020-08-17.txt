The government was handing them a GOLDEN GOOSE.  They would have become wildly rich just riding it out long term, collecting their absurd compensation, and they would have resurrected one of the most recognized companies in the USA.  Instead, the fucking morons decided to award themselves some absurd amount of stock options right before the deal went public.  As if they needed to loot the place and bolt!  These guys were being handed a government contract worth billions of dollars!  And their response was to loot the fucking coffers!  They are going to get sued to absolute oblivion.  In fact, they'll probably go to jail.  It's like they couldn't wait a year for their 8 digit payouts?!  Fucking MORONS|2020-08-17 09:01:51

Have a checking account $XLF  Own a pc? $INTC, $AMD?  **tl;dr** buy fractional shares of companies you already make purchases from, not shit you never heard of but on WSB.

And there is always an analyst out there who is going to try and beat the other analysts with their bull thesis so they can say they predicted the rally. The lesson we should all learn from TSLA is that with enough money, we can all be a visionary game changer.|2020-08-17 09:36:13

1vh2gk|ibbhcu|ibbhcu|4|My wife went to Kohls this weekend and reported a line out the door for people doing returns. This is because Kohls closed its fitting rooms due to COVID, so people have to buy the clothes and take them home to try them on, then return them if they don't like them or they don't fit. Lots of returns sounds bad at first, but imagine that if that many people are returning clothes, there have to be some who are saying "fuck it, it fits good enough" and keeping their purchases when they otherwise wouldn't have (if they had tried it on in the store). And having to go back to the store means more foot traffic and potentially more sales. And don't forget about people doing their AMZN returns at Kohls -- more shopping on AMZN means more returns, and even more foot traffic for Kohls. I wouldn't be surprised if they beat expectations tomorrow and guide higher. Debit spread $KSS 8/21 25/27C|2020-08-17 10:54:41

1w51aa|ibbhcu|ibbhcu|1|I figured out a way to explain spreads and contracts to my friends.  Lets say cocaine is trading at 50 a g right now and you think its gonna go up  so you buy a contract to buy it in the future for 55 a g  bc at the time its a cheap deal and you think its a safe bet.  Then you sell a contract to sell those grams at 60 at a later date.  so you lock it in,  if cocaine goes up you did well -  but if cocaine goes up to 100 a g you are still selling at 60. 55 is your long, 60 is your short. Together it's a spread.  The max you make is 5 a g and if cocaine stays below the 55 mark you dont make dick bc they'll buy it somewhere else.  edit: should I sell courses on this? y/n|2020-08-17 13:42:47

1wcu1n|ibbhcu|ibbhcu|-4|For everyone saying the market doesn't make sense, let me explain something to you. The market is the most rational mechanism out there. All information in the minds of people is reflected in the stock price. The only reason it doesn't make sense to you is because you don't have access to full information like the market does. Tesla makes sense 100% of the way! Just wait till the general public finds out from the headlines that Tesla is far superior to all other EV makers and that they can now get the stock at an "affordable" (split price). Everything makes sense you just need to look into the future and be optimistic :)   SPY 400 EOM|2020-08-17 14:34:54

1v25p2|ibbhcu|ibbhcu|-3|So I made quite a nice profit off TSLA when it went from \~$200 - $500.    I thought I was being smart by selling it and waiting for the next dip. It continued.    I fomod back in at $800. Doubled it yet again.    Last week I decided to say fuck it yolo. I put all my savings in TSLA @ $1500 + took out a line of credit with 2% PA interest.      50% of my money are regular stocks.    25% is x5 leveraged CFDs   25% is the line of credit without leverage.      Even though they aren't options, the leveraged CFDs and the line of credit can still fuck me hard. This is my life savings. Losing it isn't going to really put me on the streets, but it would still suck. I'm legit scared. What the fuck am I doing|2020-08-17 09:36:13
