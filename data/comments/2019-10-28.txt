5mworo|do7bfc|do7bfc|10|Welcome to another week and more **Magical Crayons TA**!  If you're wondering how TA has been doing lately, here's a screenshot of price action against trendlines I drew about two weeks ago. [What you see is that we hit upward momentum trendlines nearly on the button every time at open.](https://imgur.com/g3tDJ1P) So if you aren't convinced the algos are controlling the market I hope this gives you some idea of what's going on. Everything is pretty manipulated and bullshitty without volume.  As I predicted last week at closing of market, [cracking of 302 led to a runup towards 304](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dn2wfh/weekend_discussion_thread_october_2527_2019/f587n8x/). We didn't hit 304 but given the hopium of the market, the performance of AAPL and FOMC would well push us there and to 305. Current trends suggest we could hit 305 tomorrow, but given Google's earnings, I suspect we are more likely to trade flat but above the 303 range until news is released.   For bears I have more bad news, which is these gap ups make more technical supports for the market. Expecting an intraday plummet to 290 to save your terrible timed puts is basically impossible. What it does suggest though is that if we start dropping there should be plenty of time to pile in. If you're bearish, you should be watching for a collapse of the 300.8 mark. That is a strong support that took SPY over a week to finally break. If it loses that support, we probably visit 298-297 fairly quickly, and if that collapses 295 is going to hit like a truck.  So all that being said, the tl;dr is that market is run by robots, you should touch yourself responsibly, and as always, may tendies bless your portfolios.|2019-10-28 15:26:50

5lhqxr|do7bfc|do7bfc|5|Let's talk about rate cuts for a second. Market is pricing in a 95% chance of a cut right now. Here are some things from the last fed meeting:  > But documents released after the meeting also showed sharp divisions among members about the future path of policy. >Minutes amplified those concerns, along with some worry that a market clamoring for easier monetary policy might be getting ahead of itself. The summary said that "a few participants" at the September meeting said prices in futures markets "were currently suggesting greater provision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate."  And   >The "dot plot" of member expectations released at the meeting showed that five members favored the Fed not approving any additional cuts this year after the most recent move, five more seeing an increase ahead, and seven wanting an additional cut. >The final tally among the 10 voting members saw three dissents from Fed presidents ‚Äì Eric Rosengren of Boston and Esther George of Kansas City, who favored holding the line, and James Bullard of St. Louis who wanted a half-point cut. That marked the most dissenters since December 2014.  95% seems way too fucking high. With the markets at ATH, and decent earnings, I honestly think there is a good shot at no cut OR AT LEAST a much more hawkish rhetoric coming from the fed|2019-10-28 11:04:30

I've been selling covered calls since for some solid premium gains. $33+ has always been my sell target. I sold 11/1 $33c last week for $1.30/ea. With ER+Fed+economic numbers this week, dynamic price movement is all but guaranteed. I'm trying to decide whether I should buy it back and sell the shares for a very solid 2-month gain, let it ride and hope we close the week over $33, buy it back and hope we we moonshot, or just pick up a $33 put to protect my gains.

5kzn8a|do7bfc|do7bfc|3|holyshit TA's pretty amazing. Well i guess we'll see  how amazing  So i had these box ranges drawn from the balance area from last week, they're 35 points wide on spx. As per shadowtrader teachings when a balance area is established we can either look above and go/fail or look below and go/fail.  When the market "look's above/below" you add the width of your original balance area on top on the first.  We looked above and failed on tuesday, then on thursday we went above the range and close there (bullish af despite the selloff midday) and on friday we closed above the balance area at 3022.  Guess where we hit the fucking wall today ?   3008 + 35 = 3043, we reached 3042.3  This rally still has about an hour to go if it's to do as usual.  He warned this weekend that the market internals weren't so good in spite of the price action's bullishness, therefor i'm shorting this shit once we hit the top of the box  PT 3043, i'm getting my last 1000‚Ç¨ into 8X inverse s&p etf|2019-10-28 09:14:09

5l4kry|do7bfc|do7bfc|-4|Free DD for our MCD losers.  MCD is seen as the old man of fast food unable to innovate past its red meat/fried food wheelhouse.  We're a year in the veggie burger craze and they have zero product. Burger King sells beyond already, perhaps even a contract that locks MCD out.  MCD six month is a huge run up on zero news and middling if not poor ERs each time.  MCD six month was probably based on "wait for their veggie burger" and when that didn't materialize, the big sell came.  MCD is vastly overbought and EOY profit taking is gonna happen to ridiculous stocks like these.  MCD isn't doing buybacks.|2019-10-28 09:45:41
