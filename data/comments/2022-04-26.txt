2vxxws|o6xtau|o6xtau|3|WISH’s growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year.  However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.  So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They’re paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.  If you completely discount these one off charges from going public, $WISH still has over 200M in EBITDA losses, which doubled over the past year despite revenue only increasing 35%. EBITDA loss margin is expanding which is exactly what you want to avoid in a growing company. The point of owning any growth company, like TSLA who recently reached positive EBITDA, is for the EBITDA loss to increase slower than the revenue or even decrease. This was during covid when basically every ecommerce competitor did better than $WISH.  Bluntly, the company is spending too much. Shares have been squeezed up nearly 100% from the low. There's better opportunities out there than $WISH right now.|2021-06-24 09:14:07

The beautiful thing about IDEX vertically integrating into the broader EV space, is it makes them a great target to be acquired one day. That said, it's clear they are not simply looking for an exit. They have been, and will continue to, maneuvering the company to capture a growing slice of revenue from several sectors within the EV ecosystem.  This is a no brainer investment - the world-wide momentum around EV and its infrastructure will only continue to grow.

2wodro|o6xtau|o6xtau|13|*Narrator: The apes, indeed, did make it to the moon, but not as they’d intended. The remarkably heavy WISH and CLOV bags resulted in margin calls and steep sell offs. This was the same day Elon’s “Starlink” exploded and scared the aliens who were presently monitoring human civilization. Sadly, the apes were sold as slaves to Elon Musk’s emergency predecessor, and used for new SpaceX experiments. One ape was resold by a lower level engineer to rocket lab (VACQ) for a low orbit launch just days before the first alien invasion of July 18th, 2021 and still orbits our home planet of Earth to this day in 3492.*|2021-06-24 12:30:09

And over $400 million cash on hand.  Their margins have also dropped.  What does this mean?  They have the ability to overcome the supply issue, and will still make a profit in doing so.  Avg target Price: $50.  **TL;DR**: La-Z-Boy dipped, but should have climbed.

2vgjf5|o6xtau|o6xtau|6|CLNE has 416 institutional owners.  If each owner owned 250,000 shares(2.75 M$) that's 1/2 of the entire float locked away, and not for sald.  Each one does not own that many shares currently is my guess.  So probably 1/2-1/4 of the entire float is not traded.  I think this could cause dramatic moves higher.|2021-06-24 06:24:33

2vgh37|o6xtau|o6xtau|6|13 When Elon heard that tech stocks were up, he took a personal loan and deposited it into Robinhood. Hearing of this, the WSB Autsitcs followed his plays.   14 When Elon landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and told them to Dump their Apple calls  15 As evening approached, the autistics came to him and said, “This is a risky play, and the company is trading at 1000 PE. Send the Boomers to buy XOM/BA/INTC/GE so that they may go live on 3% yield.”  16 Elon replied, “They do not need to sell. We will give them a YOLO.”  17 “We have here only $500 in our Robinhood accounts and rent is due in 5 days,” they answered.  18 “Bring this $500 here to me,” he said. And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the $500 and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks to Lord Kitty and bought 10 2DTE $700C. Then he gave the play to the retards, and those retards gave to more retards.   20 They all hit 100 baggers, and the retards then went all in on $1000 0DTE with screams of REEE and MEMES.....and nothing was leftover.   21 The number of those who roped themselves were many, except one retard who accidentally bought puts.|2021-06-24 06:23:44

2voep7|o6xtau|o6xtau|5|Goldman Sachs says thank you:   Goldman Sachs bought - and then sold - a notable stake in a small Danish biotech company that went into a stock even last week.   Orphazyme, a biotechnology company based in Copenhagen, Denmark, said the bank's holdings had grown to 5.58% of the company's shares as of June 16. Then, just a day later, the bank's stake fell below the 5% threshold that triggers a deposit.   U.S. Orphazyme deposit stocks rose 61% on June 16, then fell for the next three days. The bank did not respond to Insider's request for comment on the matter.   The stock has been on a wild ride since June 10, when it jumped 1,387% in a single trading day. The company rose to popularity on Reddit's Wall Street Bets that day, though some retail traders questioned whether the trade was a hedge fund pump and dump.|2021-06-24 07:51:23

You’ll live with regret for the rest of your life and that will be your fault.   Secondly, stop posting your opinion about the vote. Please. It is only causing division. It’s like watching conservatives and liberals trying to make their points to one another. You can’t change someone’s mind when they have made it up.   We should be posting only DD, motivational posts, and hilarious memes as far as I am concerned. I hope the real ones agree.

2vyoa9|o6xtau|o6xtau|0|Anyone know anything about ATOS?  Biotech stock that's run from 4 to 7 in the last few weeks. A covered call on it with a delta of 0.5 (going to 9 dollars) Is worth like 200... which is almost 30% of the capital required for 100 shares (!!!)  That seems kind of insane. I can buy in at 7 and instantly increase my portfolio by 30% selling these calls? It would have to fall down to 5 bucks a share for me to actually start losing money? And the likelihood of it hitting 9 is pretty high apparently with a delta of 0.6...

2wf4oh|o6xtau|o6xtau|0|I got high yesterday and started thinking what would happen if stocks could only be traded over the weekend via option exercise. All trading during the week would just be in options; a "market order" to sell would sell a call and buy a put at the same strike price for the maximum total return (premium + exercise). Friday's "max pain" price would count as the closing price for determining whether options are exercised.|2021-06-24 11:22:55

Prominent engineering consulting firm that has shifted their focus to LEED-certification (reduced carbon) standards.    $INTU is just wildly overvalued imo - kicking myself for not getting in when it dipped under $400 last month but expect a downturn sometime in the next 3-6 months. Their software has been riddled with issues the last year and their customer service sucks. Their business model is self-limiting as their main customers are people who handle their own taxes/bookkeeping, and accounting firms that provide tax and bookkeeping services. They already have a dominant market share that can only go down (and will, if their shitty reputation among accountants continues).|2021-06-24 12:25:54

2wgd73|o6xtau|o6xtau|0|Just a basic thought:  We can trust in whatever thesis we like, but really our profits are only as good as our consistent trading skills with some lucks.  Lucks are not reliable. So, that's where trading strategy comes into play to eliminate the emotional trades for a better and higher percentage outcomes of our trades/profits.  Edit: they said, and many of them, XOM is too big to have an upside for them to maximize their trading profits. That's because their trading skill is limited. So they choose to trust in whatever thesis and look for a cheap priced stocks calling it undervalued in hope of a massive upside gain. But it's all boiling down to supply and demand in any sectors. What great thesis does a meme stock has -- absolutely nothing but it can still lit 🔥 up because of the trading strategy of gamma/short squeeze. Bottom line is your profits are only as good as your trading skills and ability to see opportunities, not just a thesis of anything.|2021-06-24 11:32:00

2x09w9|o6xtau|o6xtau|0|Not an overnight 10 bagger, but expect rally in sp as revenue growth goes in the black.  LUMN has found new support. FCF enough to pay the $1.00 dividend although revenue declining slightly. Will be able to retire all upcoming debt. Long @ 9.70 average cost with Oct, Jan and Jan 2023 calls. Bears argue they operate within dying industry and their biz model will not be able adapt to the digital revolution but that is a shallow stance. Share price will pop once a positive earnings growth is posted in the 10-Q. You heard it here first. should be a 4% dividend yield which implies stock price of $25.00|2021-06-24 13:57:57

2x7ini|o6xtau|o6xtau|0|SDC news, again. Trading 3% higher than earlier in the day.  This is just beginning. You may get a lower price, but the wedge don't lie. Short sellers pushed it to the limit, and sure enough, as it got cornered, volume picked up and the price shot u by 30 cents, not bad when trading off of 8.74.  Add this to your watchlist to grasp the magnitude of the potential profits ahead. Cheers   (come and discuss or get more info on r/StockSDC )|2021-06-24 14:52:33
