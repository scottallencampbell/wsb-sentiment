Manly though for sharing how you watch for tickers and how to play sentiment.   I have been recently following FUTURES and VIX which has been great for judging short term volatility.    I'm sure there is much better ways but still trying to get my feet wet.  Far from being able to call myself a trader just a great hobby.  THANK YOU WSB!|2021-12-14 09:12:36

ojl2ps|rg53un|rg53un|18|I'm not happy about my portfolio being bombed but I'm actually happy if the fed raise the rates, that means the price of housing and rent may get lower and we make more money in the long term on big purchases instead of getting cash playing options.  Right now, houses are nearly DOUBLE the cost they were just 4 years ago. Thats insane and it pisses me off. WHy did prices go up so much, why are people charging so much for old houses and WHO ARE THESE FUCKERS ACTUALLY PAYING THESE PRICES??? WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHY?????  Because rates are so low, banks allow people to borrow more money. With more money they can pay for more expensive houses. Home sellers see they have the cash and raise prices on their houses and realize people will pay nearly any price because they have the cash to do it.  Fuck man, if people took the loans and said NO FUCK YOU to all these corps wanting 150k more for a house that was half the price a year ago we'd have more affordable homes, more money, less fucking inflation. They should have NEVER lowered the damn rates.|2021-12-14 12:47:54

Added bonus is it only works if you are in wsb  The secret is to watch what /u/AxemanFromMA is buying and inverse it. He‚Äôs gets OTM calls you buy ITM puts. When he finally gives in and buys OTM puts to try and cash in with a multibagger on a bear market you know the bottom is in and it‚Äôs time for ITM calls.

oj1dwk|rg53un|rg53un|4|Fisker $FSR (NYSE:FSR) Valued at $7.8b or $26.2 per share    Valuation Report:    [https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/fisker-nysefsr-valuation-report?r=qm3pq&utm\_campaign=post&utm\_medium=web](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/fisker-nysefsr-valuation-report?r=qm3pq&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)  In my view, the company will make around $26b in 2031 and will have a 6% EBIT margin, but lower than the EV market leader Tesla.        The free cash flows to the firm will come significantly later in the life-cycle, around 2030 - 2031.        I expect Fisker to be a value adding company with a Cost of Capital of 6.3% vs a Return on Invested Capital of 16%.        The biggest risk for Fisker, will be market demand. The company can ramp-up production and include external partners, however, people have not heard of the brand, and the direct-to-consumer sales strategy may not be enough to convince them to buy.        Investment timing should be ideally restricted up to Q3 2022, after which news coverage is expected to heavily increase. Investors should slowly add to their initial position if management delivers on operating income.|2021-12-14 10:40:20

oi88fs|rg53un|rg53un|6|I think there's plenty of reasons to be bullish that markets can get a lift once we get past the Fed meeting, and the biggest one is the cash allocations we're seeing now:  "This month‚Äôs investor cash allocation increased 14 percentage points from November to a net 36% overweight, the highest exposure since May 2020, according to BofA‚Äôs last fund manager survey of the year. Market participants slashed their equity positions to the lowest since October 2020, although investments in stocks remained above the historical average."  Typically you do see cash allocations reach their maximums a bit past the bottom (big money gets caught on the sidelines and then rushes back in); this is a bit of an odd situation right now due to last week's low volume pump bringing us back near ATHs.  Makes it more likely we get a big bull run at some point.|2021-12-14 07:01:16

Full AP is never happening (unless the government lowers safety standards). Mercedes beat Tesla and made full AP. Company with a prestigious reputation for safety, innovation and reliability.  Cybertruk is going to have mirrors, which ruins the whole thing. Ford will have 5-10x the amount of EV trucks delivered at half the price by next year, an amount Tesla could only dream to deliver in 5 years...  Everyone has some form of fastcharge... Hell Ford has the patent for liquid cooled 5-min extreme supercharging.  Tesla is too small to demand more share of the scarce chip resources and relies way too heavily on it. Ford is developing their own chip production...  Price: Ford $39k, Tesla Cyberfuk (too much)  Do you feel that this will make TSLA go up? Or continue to snowball downward.
