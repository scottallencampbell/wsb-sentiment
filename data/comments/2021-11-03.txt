Beginning in December, the Committee    will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and    of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month. The    Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely    be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if    warranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing    purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market    functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of    credit to households and businesses.|2021-11-03 13:01:56

But if something bad happens you'll lose.

This way they don’t risk not getting the credit in case last minute language changes ie ordered on or after Jan 1 vs delivered on or after Jan 1.  As a sign of good faith and show commitments they did the advertising campaign and press release which Elon supported and perhaps even deliberately doing the tweet a week later to keep hertz and Tesla in headlines.

j5o0tp|qlr721|qlr721|6|  If you feel like reading be my guest.  US Economics Analyst: From Tapering to Rate Hikes (Mericle/Hatzius)  29 October 2021  8:46PM EDT  ■ We are pulling forward our forecast for the Fed’s first rate hike by one full year to July 2022, shortly after tapering is scheduled to conclude. We expect a second hike in November 2022 and two hikes per year after that. However, the range of possible outcomes is wide, especially in the longer term. ■ The FOMC will announce the start of tapering next week, presumably at the $15bn per month pace noted in the September minutes. If implementation begins in mid-November, the last taper would come in June 2022. Large surprises on the virus, inflation, wage growth, or inflation expectations could prompt a revision, but we think the hurdle for a change in either direction is high. ■ The main reason for the change in our liftoff call is that we now expect core PCE inflation to remain above 3%—and core CPI inflation above 4%—when the taper concludes. Sequential core inflation should be lower at that point but still around 2%, with shelter running hot. Taken together, we think this will make a seamless move from tapering to rate hikes the path of least resistance. ■ The biggest complication is the guidance in the FOMC statement that even the first rate hike requires maximum employment. However, with inflation far above target, unemployment likely below the median participant’s 4% NAIRU estimate, and job availability high, we think the committee will conclude that most if not all of the remaining weakness in labor force participation is structural or voluntary. ■ We maintain our view that growth will slow to a trend-like pace and inflation will drop to the low 2s by late 2022 or early 2023, without an aggressive monetary policy response. The key reasons are that the level of fiscal support will continue to decline sharply and supply chain problems should be resolved, turning the inflationary surge in the goods sector into a temporary deflationary drag. ■ As a result, we see the possible paths ahead as bimodal: if something delays liftoff long enough for growth and inflation to fall sharply by end-2022, the Fed could stay on hold for a while. This was the scenario we previously envisioned. ■ Beyond 2022, we forecast one hike every six months. We see this pace as plausible either as a dovish response if inflation remains modestly above 2% or as an average outcome if inflation fluctuates above and below 2%.|2021-11-03 10:14:15

j6rsf1|qlr721|qlr721|0|In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least $30 billion per month.    So they’re still increasing asset purchases but by a tapered amount??? Can someone read this and make sure I’m not crazy?|2021-11-03 14:25:44

j4v0v3|qlr721|qlr721|-12|I just got a few comments saying I don’t understand politics. Let me put it this way you absolute cunts- Biden won Virginia by 10 points. Virginia just elected a republican governor who was expected to lose the election and was not a Trump type candidate. Virginia was SOLIDLY in Dem’s pockets and they lost the governor seat. This doesn’t bode well for them.   This means Biden just lost Congress. Or at least, republicans now see a light at the end of the tunnel. They see a way to win. They have the votes. They don’t need Trump. They have Congress in the bag in a few months. Same thing happened to Obama during midterms.   Now that they know pretty soon that Congress will be theirs (if they swung Virginia, they’re probably going to kill the midterms), they will not cooperate. They will put added pressure on Manchin and no infrastructure bill will pass.   It’s a bad outlook for the bill passing, which will shake investor confidence. That with the FOMC means today is likely to be bearish.|2021-11-03 06:23:59

j5vg4w|qlr721|qlr721|0|RIOT is the play this week.  &#x200B;  OI on the call chain was mostly low delta at the beginning of the week.  Heavy, heavy daily shorting for the last two months.  &#x200B;  Bullish numbers on their October mining report.  &#x200B;  ER is 11/15 after hours (not 11/8 as still estimated on websites).  &#x200B;  Last chance to get in before it starts to retest ATHs of $79 by year end.  Assuming it makes up a good bit of that this week with the momentum of necessary buy-ins.  &#x200B;  Unlike MARA, their shelf offering is more than likely over and they are flush with cash ($600M from shelf).  MARA is probably announcing a substantial ($400M+) ATM equity raise in the next few weeks since they only have $20 million cash on hand.|2021-11-03 11:01:30
