That is THE delta hub. What happens when the travel ban goes up bigly next week? Its trumps only way to make people feel safe in the retarded set of options in his playbook. Plus, if he doesn't, ATL airport is gonna be a corona hot zone.   I do not know what is propping DAL up but at the end of the day realities have a way of making themselves known. This aint China, and tickets need to be bought in order to keep valuation up. What happens when Delta's flights go down by 30%?

ix0ldo|faahp8|faahp8|4|Today may be difficult for trading. With Futures being 40+ points down, do you buy puts on the S&P or calls?  If  this was up 40 points, it would be an easier decision. But we're easily  in an oversold condition from a technical standpoint so a lot of puts  may quickly become very uncomfortable very quickly in the short term  even if the markets continue to fall.  Eventually,  without fail, some of the big boys are going to swoop in for an easy  payday and wipe all of the trades by mass lifting the markets by pumping  and clearing the board. This will happen. So being down like this on a  Thursday when a lot of people are going to be looking to close positions  by the weekend is cause for second thought.  I  have a feeling that a lot of people with expiring 2/28 options might  get trapped. Of course, I could be wrong. But markets opening so low  usually confuses me. Especially when longer term downward momentum is  most obvious.|2020-02-27 07:18:13

iy12zk|faahp8|faahp8|3|As a biochemist, I think Gilead has the most potential to invest in. Their drug is a nucleotide analogue and incorporates into the viral RNA and stops it from reproducing, and your immune system can take out the virus. $MRNA is focusing on a vaccine that is based on proteins expressed on the surface of corona, so that your immune system can fight it off before you're infected. Given that GILEAD is already testing this treatment, and vaccines take months to determine their efficacy, and the subtle transmission of the virus, I'm sure more people will be infected. The best way to contain the virus is by treating infected people rather than future proactive treatment that is months down the road|2020-02-27 13:06:40

ixbr8w|faahp8|faahp8|2|**GILD is just a hype play imo.**   This is coming from the guy that had that big DD post about it several days ago.  Remdesivir, their drug, is an IV drip drug. The clinical trials they are doing have people on 5 and 10 day IV drips. Think about that...its not a pill. You can't just hand it out. It won't lower hospitalization rates, because you have to be admitted before getting the treatment.  If/when they announce positive clinical trial results, GILD will shoot up. That is pretty much guaranteed. However Remdesivir will not be a big profit maker for them UNLESS this becomes a permanent virus that we deal with for several decades.  The reason its not mooning today again is because there is no extra profit to keep the price up. So if it gets a 5 or 10% bump from the media before results are released, its just gonna slide back down until it happens.   I always planned on selling at the announcement because I knew there's no way it holds $80 for a drug they can't charge that much for and that only has ~20k current potential customers.|2020-02-27 09:26:17

Diamond hands saved me this time, but when break-even got in sight, I put a trailing stop on which was triggered at a few $100  loss.

ix62io|faahp8|faahp8|4|   A second cultural factor behind the epidemic are traditional Chinese beliefs about the powers of certain foods, which have encouraged some hazardous habits. There is, in particular, the aspect of Chinese eating culture known as ‚Äújinbu,‚Äù (ÈÄ≤Ë£ú) meaning, roughly, to fill the void. Some of its practices are folklorish or esoteric, but even among Chinese people who don‚Äôt follow them, the concept is pervasive.   It is better to cure a disease with food than medicine, so starts the holistic theory. Illnesses result when the body is depleted of blood and energy ‚Äî though not the kind of blood and energy studied in biology and physics, but a mystic version.   For men, it is most important to fill the energy void, which is related to virility and sexual prowess; for women, the stress is on replacing blood, which improves beauty and fertility. Rare plants and animals from the wild are thought to bring the best replenishment, especially when eaten fresh or raw. Winter is said to be the season when the body needs more ‚Äújinbu‚Äù foods. (Could that help explain why both SARS and the current epidemic broke out during that time of year?)   Hard-core believers in ‚Äújinbu‚Äù seem to buy into this notion, too: ‚ÄúLike-shapes eaten strengthen like-shapes‚Äù (‰ª•ÂΩ¢Ë£úÂΩ¢), with the word ‚Äúshapes‚Äù sometimes referring to human organs and their functions. Adherents count as favorites a long list of exotic foods ‚Äî whose methods of procurement or preparation can be outright cruel, with some simply too revolting to describe here.   I‚Äôve seen snakes and the penises of bulls or horses ‚Äî great for men, the theory goes ‚Äî on offer at restaurants in many cities in southern China. Bats, which are thought to be the original source of both the current coronavirus and the SARS virus, are said to be good for restoring eyesight ‚Äî especially the animals‚Äô granular feces, called ‚Äúsands of nocturnal shine‚Äù (Â§úÊòéÁ†Ç). Gallbladders and bile harvested from live bears are good for treating jaundice; tiger bone is for erections.   More mundane yet no less popular is the palm civet (ÊûúÂ≠êÁã∏), a small, wild quadruped suspected of having passed on the SARS virus to humans. When stewed with snake meat, it is said to cure insomnia.   Less wealthy people might turn to dog meat ‚Äî preferably a dog that has been chased around before being slaughtered, because some people believe that more ‚Äújinbu‚Äù benefits are reaped from eating an animal whose blood and energy ran high. Similarly, it is thought that animals killed just before serving are more ‚Äújinbu‚Äù potent, which is one reason the more exotic offerings in wet markets tend to be sold alive ‚Äî also making them more potent vectors for any virus they might carry.  **Like**|2020-02-27 08:25:35

Rather than going short, I'm hedging my bets by buying ammo and buying dips.   If the market collapses, all my money is worthless anyway and I have great trade value in my ammunition. Don't get the meme calibers, just straight 5.56 NATO and maybe some 300AAC. Why 300 Blackout? The .300 cartridge is shot by only the most autistic gun nuts and preppers who likely already have their bug-out supplies while they are readying for the boogaloo. Those rounds are in high demand and expensive (at least until Wolf releases their steel-cased in March).   If this all passes, then the dips I bought will be tasty and I have more ammo to go shoot at the range. If it doesn't pass, then I've got subsonic ammo ready to go so I don't blow my ears out while killing zombies in my house.

I can almost guarantee those are going to be absolutely abysmal and European indexes are gonna tank the rest of the global market, continuing down.  Probably Monday afternoon, would be a good look to bounce, once we hit 3000 or 2900 on S&P. Go through that, then probably not til 2700.  Stay away from the NASDAQ.

In between finishing my flip and around the beginning of January I decided to deposit 700 bucks into my tasty works. Currently it's sitting at 14K.
