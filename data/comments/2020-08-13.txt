1bfyvs|i8xa70|i8xa70|87|#The Bagholder and The Frog  Once upon a time there was a bagholder and a frog. The bagholder needed to cross the river so he asked the frog for a ride on his back.   The frog agreed to the bagholder’s request but said “only if you promise to sell those -80% calls as those bags are too heavy for me to carry across the river”.  The bagholder replied “Why would I carry these worthless options with me? We would both drown.”  The frog agreed and told the bagholder to meet him at the river the next day.  The next day came and the bagholder and frog began their journey across the river.   Halfway through, the bagholder opened his Robinhood and saw that his PRPL and SLV calls had fallen to -99%, dooming them both.  “Why would you not sell? Now we will both drown!”, cried the frog.  The bagholder replied “it is in my nature”.  *The End.*|2020-08-13 06:32:46

1c78w0|i8xa70|i8xa70|12|I don't think Stimulus gets done until after the election now.  Republican Senate conservatives don't want a stimulus vote fresh in their voter's minds as fiscal spending is their fucking platform.  Democrats want to do whats right for people, but also understand that this situation likely angers independent voters into potentially voting blue (or not at all?) So why budge too much?  These parties are 2 Trillion away right now. Democrats offered to meet in the middle, but the Republicans are firm on 1T and no mail in ballot protections. If the mail in ballot continues to hold shit up, no deal will get made.  The executive orders won't impact anyone for almost a month, and by then some States & Local governments will be in dire financial situations. That money runs dry fast.  Buckle up. This isn't going to be pretty.|2020-08-13 10:52:48

Starting to sound like the real disagreement isn't the dollar number so much as it is boiling down to issues related to voting by mail. I do not think this is a good sign for stimmy passing.

After going through mortgage and brokers they’re all such a fucking archaic industry, it’s so ripe for a great digital process until the notary.  That said, what really matters is if consumers will be comfortable making the switch. I think so, but the millennials are lagging hard on real estate purchasing because they have no money.  I think I’m going to buy 2k shares and transfer to IRA. Options don’t make sense here imo with every ring going on, but real estate is great inflation protection and the rich will gobble up any real estate dips.

1c20yk|i8xa70|i8xa70|6|I live in the deep south and this is what is going on.  My kids are in school.  I went by a local high school today and the football team was out practicing in pads.  Last night i went to pick up some take out from a strip mall and the gym there was packed. There was some sort of class going on in there and every machine was occupied.  And this was the smallest "gym" you can imagine - basically a small strip mall store size.  We are either going to live with this kind of moderately high level of spread and just make it through or in a couple of weeks the hospitals here are going to be overwhelmed.  I'm hoping the latter does not occur but I'm nervous.  I've got my MMR vaccine boost and am working out every day I can handle it.  Hopefully all the colds and viruses my kids have gotten over the past few years have our immune systems up.|2020-08-13 10:12:20

It ain't much but its honest work.  edit: those contracts that were worth .37 are worth .11 now but I won't blow a day trade closing them out.

Hydrogen Tech Collaboration With Hyundai, Even After Two Rejections  8/13/20, 9:57 AM August 13, 2020 03:57 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News  Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) founder Trevor Milton is keen on a collaboration with Hyundai Motor Co (OTC:HYMTF) on hydrogen technology, a spokesperson for the electric vehicles company told Reuters.   What Happened  “Trevor has immense respect for Hyundai and views Hyundai amongst the leaders in hydrogen around the world.” Nicole Rose said in an emailed statement to Reuters, confirming Milton’s intent to work with Hyundai.   “Trevor has, and will continue to be, open to collaborate if they ever choose to do so,” the Nikola spokesperson added.  The two automakers are not in talks as of now, according to an unnamed source of Reuters, who said, “If Nikola makes an official offer, Hyundai can consider the proposal.”|2020-08-13 06:39:59

1cmeg1|i8xa70|i8xa70|2|Rather than selling my MSFT $215c 8/14 for a 85% loss, I’m gonna hold and see how tomorrow goes. The RSI is so low on this that there should be an oversold bounce that nets me a 3-5% on the underlying ticker.      It did this on 8/5 when SPY stayed relatively flat, let’s see if it happens again. Really though I’m just heartbroken and am holding the -85% calls for sentiment. Rather than be a coward and retain 15% of my capital, I’m gonna let it ride.

1bndmm|i8xa70|i8xa70|1|here’s a thought..  market is getting propped up to precovid prices from the fed injecting liquidity. we now are at these prices with these insane problems at hand - and all that money is in the pockets of precovid share holders (cash). also, government has exercised extreme amounts of stimulus and seems to be some form of more. so any news that’s positive that fixes these outstanding problems, obviously will bring back the money that was once removed, on top of the new money that kept the prices even. causing this illusion that we’re at all time highs, when really, we just hit reset with new parameters for the starting point and then hit play. i say it’s not really all time highs until SPY is at $410-20|2020-08-13 07:59:28

Need to keep an eye on buying power and may need to close some trades if buying power drops any lower. My theta number is actually too big, so I may close a few trades anyway to lower my risk.  Biggest positions are in IWM, QQQ, and AMD. Each underlying has an overall negative delta, so there is some downside protection. So I'm just chilling today and will adjust the portions up or down to maintain that slightly downward bias (it's protection against volatility expansion.)|2020-08-13 05:20:09

Dont see who will buy these bags and it's not that silver got more usecases in the last months, if anything, lower economic growth will slow down the industrial demand for silver.

1c4err|i8xa70|i8xa70|0|So we haven't reached a stimulus deal, although markets priced it in happening last week, yet stonks didn't fall, instead just rotated. However, markets still obviously believe that we're going to get another stimulus bill. People dying from coronavirus doesn't scare the markets anymore because we're going to get a vaccine before EOY, and those who die don't matter.   Nothing can cause this great bull market to crash anymore, except if Trump loses and then he goes on an EO spree before he leaves office to fuck the markets over so the next administration can be blamed.

1c3a17|i8xa70|i8xa70|-1|Some thoughts about Microsoft/Tiktok/China. All opinions are welcome.  Microsoft is a huge company in Beijing, they get billions of dollars in China. MSFT buys Tiktok, CCP still has a connection to that data. Although that probably won't happen and isn't my concern, what do you think would happen if Microsoft pisses off the CCP in any way? Whether that's losing access to Tiktok data, Microsoft supporting Trump/US in fight against CCP, or whatever other reason, Microsoft loses billions in China. Comparison would be GOOG in January 2010 (GOOG dropped \~15% in that month) when they began pulling out of China.  I'm not saying everyone should run from MSFT, but if there are any issues between the CCP and Microsoft, that's a big issue for share price. Just something to think about when we're dealing with the Tiktok purchase.|2020-08-13 10:21:56
