1bfyvs|i8xa70|i8xa70|87|#The Bagholder and The Frog  Once upon a time there was a bagholder and a frog. The bagholder needed to cross the river so he asked the frog for a ride on his back.   The frog agreed to the bagholder‚Äôs request but said ‚Äúonly if you promise to sell those -80% calls as those bags are too heavy for me to carry across the river‚Äù.  The bagholder replied ‚ÄúWhy would I carry these worthless options with me? We would both drown.‚Äù  The frog agreed and told the bagholder to meet him at the river the next day.  The next day came and the bagholder and frog began their journey across the river.   Halfway through, the bagholder opened his Robinhood and saw that his PRPL and SLV calls had fallen to -99%, dooming them both.  ‚ÄúWhy would you not sell? Now we will both drown!‚Äù, cried the frog.  The bagholder replied ‚Äúit is in my nature‚Äù.  *The End.*|2020-08-13 06:32:46

1c78w0|i8xa70|i8xa70|12|I don't think Stimulus gets done until after the election now.  Republican Senate conservatives don't want a stimulus vote fresh in their voter's minds as fiscal spending is their fucking platform.  Democrats want to do whats right for people, but also understand that this situation likely angers independent voters into potentially voting blue (or not at all?) So why budge too much?  These parties are 2 Trillion away right now. Democrats offered to meet in the middle, but the Republicans are firm on 1T and no mail in ballot protections. If the mail in ballot continues to hold shit up, no deal will get made.  The executive orders won't impact anyone for almost a month, and by then some States & Local governments will be in dire financial situations. That money runs dry fast.  Buckle up. This isn't going to be pretty.|2020-08-13 10:52:48

Last night i went to pick up some take out from a strip mall and the gym there was packed. There was some sort of class going on in there and every machine was occupied.  And this was the smallest "gym" you can imagine - basically a small strip mall store size.  We are either going to live with this kind of moderately high level of spread and just make it through or in a couple of weeks the hospitals here are going to be overwhelmed.  I'm hoping the latter does not occur but I'm nervous.  I've got my MMR vaccine boost and am working out every day I can handle it.

Need to keep an eye on buying power and may need to close some trades if buying power drops any lower. My theta number is actually too big, so I may close a few trades anyway to lower my risk.  Biggest positions are in IWM, QQQ, and AMD. Each underlying has an overall negative delta, so there is some downside protection. So I'm just chilling today and will adjust the portions up or down to maintain that slightly downward bias (it's protection against volatility expansion.)|2020-08-13 05:20:09

1c4err|i8xa70|i8xa70|0|So we haven't reached a stimulus deal, although markets priced it in happening last week, yet stonks didn't fall, instead just rotated. However, markets still obviously believe that we're going to get another stimulus bill. People dying from coronavirus doesn't scare the markets anymore because we're going to get a vaccine before EOY, and those who die don't matter.   Nothing can cause this great bull market to crash anymore, except if Trump loses and then he goes on an EO spree before he leaves office to fuck the markets over so the next administration can be blamed. Buy stonks so we can reach ATHs and keep Donnie in office for more market volatility.|2020-08-13 10:30:32

1c3a17|i8xa70|i8xa70|-1|Some thoughts about Microsoft/Tiktok/China. All opinions are welcome.  Microsoft is a huge company in Beijing, they get billions of dollars in China. MSFT buys Tiktok, CCP still has a connection to that data. Although that probably won't happen and isn't my concern, what do you think would happen if Microsoft pisses off the CCP in any way? Whether that's losing access to Tiktok data, Microsoft supporting Trump/US in fight against CCP, or whatever other reason, Microsoft loses billions in China. Comparison would be GOOG in January 2010 (GOOG dropped \~15% in that month) when they began pulling out of China.  I'm not saying everyone should run from MSFT, but if there are any issues between the CCP and Microsoft, that's a big issue for share price. Just something to think about when we're dealing with the Tiktok purchase.|2020-08-13 10:21:56
