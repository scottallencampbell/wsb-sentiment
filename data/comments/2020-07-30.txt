zr1dww|i0ji8h|i0ji8h|5|MM‚Äôs have successfully played AMZN call holders.   Trap most of them on 7/13‚Äôs peak because people want to buy contracts before the IV spikes up, then slowly bleed for a week then pump it back up to give bag holders hope and to trap new people, then continue bleeding down as theta fucks everyone up, then call holders say might as well hold since earnings are soon, just to have AMZN run up, but not enough to make back the losses from theta and their shitty entry point.   The best part of all, MM‚Äôs knew that everyone had a strong image of AMZN and didn‚Äôt think AMZN could fall so I‚Äôm sure a lot of people bet pretty hard on them. If you‚Äôve been bag-holding AMZN for 3 weeks, you‚Äôd need amazon at 3900+ to even break even.|2020-07-30 12:40:53

I started sucking his cock in the empty parking lot, and I almost choke because I'm laughing so fucking hard. My friend is also laughing his ass off too, because this is the greatest prank ever. He starts making train noises while yelling, "BROJOB! BROJOB! CHOO CHOO!". When he cums, I swallow it like I'm some faggot. I kissed him and call him a faggot while laughing.

This is bad if you get left bagholding. Bad also because lately that usually means the USD rises and also pushes Gold down which makes Miners sell more.  This creates opportunities however. If today ends up bigly red. JNUG, GDX, AUY..ect are selling off too. They'll rip back up as soon as we get a green day.   Be careful though because you can practically expect the Gold selloff when it happens in the U.S. session to be massive. Gold is notorious for volatility but has been on a pretty consistent bull run for a month and is due a huge correction.  Buy the dip/Average Down but watch Gold's price today. If it tanks, Miners will keep selling off.|2020-07-30 06:20:18

zr8vv6|i0ji8h|i0ji8h|8|bold prediction with absolutely nothing on the line (lawl):  All 4 tech giants will go down tomorrow after earnings. The media and big money investors will manipulate that shit down because they have puts expiring tomorrow to squeeze value out of. In fact, 5 of the last 6 weeks have had red-ish Fridays/ends of the week. Big money is too scared to not hedge with puts right now, but they want some value out of them by the end of the week. The headlines for earnings will be bearish af, and obviously manipulating sentiment.  edit: no extra cash around.. so got a couple 8/7 $100p's on TQQQ.. lawl..|2020-07-30 13:26:46

zqclon|i0ji8h|i0ji8h|3|I played around with AI Dungeon. Bold is my input. Normal text is the output from the AI. For fucks sake, this thing knows a lot. Please note that the last question was added by the AI, lol.  **Question: Hello, I'm a retarded wallstreetbets member and want to ten-bagger my portfolio. Please help. What should I do?**  Answer: You need to be more like me! I have a lot of money and I don't even know what the hell I own!  **Question: Sounds right. But where do I start?**  Answer: Well, you can go into business for yourself by starting your own company or you could just buy one that already exists. There are several companies out there with similar names.  **Question: I wanna yolo options** and get rich quick!  Answer: That is one option. You could try to do that, but you need to remember that the stock market is very hard to predict.  **Question: So make a prediction please.**  Answer: Okay. I predict that you are going to lose all your money and wind up on the streets living as a bum.  Question: Well thanks for the uplifting advice, you're an inspiration!|2020-07-30 09:27:04

For once, I didn't get greedy and went cash at the end of the day. I slept so much better and am still doing fine this morning. Why can't I do this everyday? In 15 minutes I'm going to assume we've bottomed for the day and then I'll load up before the inevitable slow bleed throughout the day. I'll outpace market losses and be pissed.

The 20 series gpus were announced in August and launched in September of 2018.   Counterpoint: It's already up 140% on the year. If the market takes a shit it'll probably take NVDA with it.

zrl0gg|i0ji8h|i0ji8h|1|Based on the volume I‚Äôm seeing in the short term for aapl, I think there is an insane amount of money on the sidelines waiting to jump in.  The call volume is largely a hedge in a sense, to allow funds to exercise and buy into Apple at a *decent* price in case it smashes earnings and is up $15 tomorrow.   I think the play for me is take profits EOD and btfd in the morning or next week. I think aapl smashes earnings... but if it goes to 400 overnight then meh it was less than a 50/50 chance, and it‚Äôs not likely to do so imo.

They were hiring cops while forcing world famous restaurants to lay off workers and risk them going bankrupt? They were doing all of that while forcing them to pay their 100,000 dollars of property taxes.  https://nypost.com/2020/06/29/nycs-rent-stabilized-owners-need-tax-relief/  >With property taxes due July 1, it should come as no shock to anyone that thousands of building owners will be unable to make their equivalent of rent payments on time. That doesn‚Äôt bode well for a city already teetering on the brink of economic collapse.  >Not long into the novel-coronavirus outbreak, **the New York City Office of Management and Budget said it was putting aside $180 million in anticipation of July 1 property-tax delinquencies. But officials didn‚Äôt anticipate the length or economic severity of the pandemic. The real figure needed could be twice that amount.**  >Last Thursday, some responsible members of the City Council tried to cut landlords a break by proposing legislation that would have dropped interest rates for delinquent property-tax payments to zero percent. But Hizzoner instructed his minions to text members during their meeting, warning that anything less than maintaining the existing 18 percent interest rate would bankrupt the city.  https://www.thecentersquare.com/new_york/nyc-mayor-says-he-wont-raise-property-taxes/article_4ac26682-ba4a-11ea-9afd-b337ad21307c.html  >(The Center Square) ‚Äì New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday he would not raise property taxes in order to get approval from state leaders to borrow money to fill a $1 billion budget shortfall. Those cuts include $1 billion to the New York City Police Department.   >The mayor said talks about that cut were still ongoing, but the NYPD would still be able to maintain the patrols needed to keep the city's residents safe.  There will be WAY MORE than 180 million dollars in the budget hole. They were hiring new cops while NYC has a 1 billion dollar cop budget cut.  https://nypost.com/2020/06/28/city-halls-push-to-bleed-out-nycs-property-owners/  >Kudos to City Councilmen Kalman Yeger, Robert Holden, Mark Gjonaj and 10 others for sticking up for city homeowners and property owners in the council debate on reducing interest for landlords delinquent in their property-tax payments.  >City Hall wants to charge landlords usurious penalties (up to 18 percent) for late payments. Team de Blasio even texted council members during the debate on Yeger‚Äôs amendment, urging them to resist.  >With tenants given a rent moratorium, how are landlords to find cash for taxes?|2020-07-30 09:43:18
