All at the same time energy/food prices will continue spiking, creating competition for resources between refugees and the domestic population.

Anyone with have a brain that knows what Ryan is capable of would never sell in a million years or under a million dollars. Once his vision for $GME comes out people will regret falling for this oh-so-obvious manipulation. Ryan wants Gamestop to be way more than just a store and it will be.

2kgmdm|tqwbxl|tqwbxl|0|a quick summary of why Ukraine/Russian negotiations will always fail.   Edit for Tl;Dr I'm personally buying a bit of oil/weat/fertilizer every time it dips hard. I keep option contracts3 months out.   USA is using Ukraine for a proxy war with Russia to get all the EU trade diverted to USA, so far it's been working. They are feeding Ukraine with weapons to keep fighting while they use the sanctions to force Europeans to buy everything from USA. It's perfect.   It is in USAs interest that the war drags on because they weaken Russia, and by consequence neutering China who cannot overtake them strategically without Russia's help. USA could not give a real shit about a country a million miles away from it, it's all about growing the GDP by securing customers for their energy sales.  You see that one of the 'must haves' for Ukraine is the security guarantee. That is like a mini-NATO where you have a bunch of countries guaranteeing Ukraine's security with their military. Simply put, if Ukraine is attacked again those countries are promising to send their military to defend it. One of the key countries Ukraine wants is USA. Why?  Because they know, without a shadow of a doubt, that USA will never accept to be a military guarantor for Ukraine and at the same time is the only guarantor that matters against Russia. Period, there's no two ways about it. USA will never engage as that would start WW3. So why is Ukraine asking for it?  Because it gives them a way out of any peace deal. Ukraine does not want to give in to Russia as long as they have weapons and aid to fight. Do not underestimate how much money the Ukrainian government officials are looting through all the financial aid they are getting. There's a lot of money to be made in this chaos. After the initial shock people always start thinking about their own benefit. As long as the weapons give them a fighting chance they can drag out the war to keep getting money/support. It's in their personal, individual interests to keep this going until they kick the russians out, or until there's a remote chance they can do this.  Also, don't think for a second that Ukraine's strategy isn't dictated by USA/UK in this deal. They are the ones supplying them with money and weapons so they are the ones really dictating terms.  The negotiations are set up to fail.  P.S Russia will never accept any of Ukraine's terms, they are playing for time to regroup and delay sanctions. Putin will not walk back from this.|2022-03-29 09:28:46

2k1cmz|tqwbxl|tqwbxl|-1|BB is percolating - Fundamentally this is so underpriced and much higher trading levels justified.   Note BB was one of 4 key names cited in January 2021 but the only one singled out for fundamental reasons (Deep Value).   Below are the results of simply taking BB‚Äôs TTM month revenues and using the multiple of its competitors:          o   SentinelOne multiple equates to a $65 BB SP.         o   CrowdStrike multiple equates to a $44 BB SP.         o   Zscaler multiple equates to a $46 BB SP.         o   Palo Alto multiple equates to a $15 BB SP.         o   Snowflake multiple equates to a $78 BB SP.          BB trades at approximately $7.50        And the comps do not have IVY, which could be huge (no exaggeration).        The argument that BB is not growing is nonsense and no longer applies ‚Äì the restructuring is complete and it is now a growth story.        IOT is growing at 40% (last quarter and guidance for this quarter and chance that increases).       Even Cybersecurity has growth traction (both last quarter and guidance for this quarter show sequential annualized growth in range of 30% and that expected to uptick as well)|2022-03-29 07:31:47

2lphmq|tqwbxl|tqwbxl|-14|Biden is trying to keep the war going by supplying the Ukranians with so much weapons hoping it will bog down Putin like during Afganistan with the dream that some how the oligarchs and the people will overthrow putin. This is in fact the worse case scenario for the west.  A quick loss by Ukraine will ensure Russia will spend a decade digesting Ukraine, while being shunned in the international markets, allowing it to face constant unrest. The pig will be too big for the python to digest, and the python just might choke to death.  Now there is such a high cost to the Russians that what they will now do is shell civilian infrastructure and use biological weapons with plausible deniability that will making Ukraine unlivable for the next decade. This will flood eastern/western europe with close to 20 million + refugees, many of which are old/young and none-working age population creating massive costs to the social safety nets of those countries. Next, the famine/energy crisis to come will create the greatest famines of this century which will cause destabilizations in the middle east/africa and those refugees will create a crisis larger than the Syrian Civil War. This will significantly increase polarization in western Europe, which will operate on more and more fragility with the Kremlin backing some anti-government factions.  I think Putin is probably 50 points ahead of Biden in IQ.|2022-03-29 14:15:32

2lx6yg|tqwbxl|tqwbxl|-8|Still so fucking bearish among fintwit bulls who missed this run. Now literally everyone is an expert on the yield curve. Hey dummy when the real sell-off comes it will happen for reasons that seem completely idiotic so you won't know it's happening. Same people who were convinced we were going to have a santa claus rally into 2022 are now totally buying into the fud. Sheep getting led around.  What we're likely to see from here is prices continuing to climb higher for the next few months as the news flow turns positive to support a much more bullish thesis (end of war, softening inflation, strong earnings, commodity prices and supply chains normalizing, etc.). Then these same people are going to finally flip bullish and go long, catch the last bit of upside, get trapped, and then when some innocuous headline crosses the tape that starts a selloff they'll call it stupid and keep averaging down. That is how bear markets start. Not with every single person calling for an imminent recession because of a flattening yield curve.  Edit: love these bear tears. You're helping prove my point.

2l1hnq|tqwbxl|tqwbxl|-6|This might be a dumb question, but here it goes.    Let's say I have 100 USD to invest. I could either buy one share of stock A) worth 100 USD or 100 shares of stock B) worth each 1 USD.    Would there be a difference in my gains if either stock rose by 10%?    My understanding would be that it does not matter how many shares I hold, only how much money I have invested. If stock A) goes up by 10% my investment is incresed by the same amount. Same goes for stock B). In both cases I would make the same amount of money.    The only difference would be that if the stock is cheaper, I can buy more shares and maybe start trading options at some point.   Edit: Thank you for the responses. As I have an inherent mistrust in myself I needed the confirmation that I came to the right conclusion, even though it was a very simple question. Thanks to you all.|2022-03-29 11:44:27

2liw5d|tqwbxl|tqwbxl|0|I think it easiest play is every time GME goes up 10%, you buy the stock the next day and sell ITM calls 1 or 2 strikes within the money that expire that same week. Works most of the time. Your breakeven is GME tanks the 10% it gained yesterday. Or in this case it would take 200 for GME to breakeven on those calls this week.|2022-03-29 13:34:38
