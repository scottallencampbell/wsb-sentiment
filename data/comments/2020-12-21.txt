gmdnct|khf71h|khf71h|13|   December 21, 2020 03:02 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News       **Palantir** (NYSE:[PLTR](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PLTR#NYSE))        shares are trading higher on Monday after the company announced the U.S.        Army's Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems opted        to execute the second year of its partnership with Palantir on the Army        Vantage program for $113.8 million.       Palantir Technologies provides organizations with solutions to manage        large disparate data sets in an attempt to gain insight and drive        operational outcomes.

Stimmy passed, there’s two viable vaccines now, and there are so many incentives to making as much vaccine as possible. In all honesty, while it’s a bad time now, the COVID shouldn’t be a problem after March 2021 (in the US anyway) since so many I’ll be vaxxed and have natural antibodies.

gkuryo|khf71h|khf71h|33|Guys, no matter what the news says, this drop has NOTHIN to do with the "new covid strain". They just go with the most "logical" reason and hit the "publish article" button.  If there was a big -1%+ drop earlier last week, they would've used any of the other 100 reasons as to why the market is "crashing"  In reality, they don't fucking know why exactly. Big money pulled out, people panic making it drop more, media shares the "explanation", people panic again, big money buys back, FOMO squad comes back at the peak. It has more to do with TA and the valuation of the biggest companies than any "news".  Will Amazon be hurt if the entire country goes on lockdown again? We know now that they'd STILL be profitable, so why would their stock price drop? Because people are dying everywhere? Because people are forced to shut down their businesses on a large scale? Maybe because a massive increase in unemployment? NOPE. They'd still rake in a shit ton of money.  Media will make it look like doomsday only for us only to hit new ATHs within a short period of time. Buy the dip, but be patient. Don't catch the falling knife until you see that shit start bouncin up baybee.  TLDR: Do your own TA, ignore the media hysteria, buy the fuckin dip, lose money anyways cause I literally have no fuckin idea what i'm talkin about|2020-12-21 05:57:51

gllyfn|khf71h|khf71h|6|Most relevant bits of final stimmy bill:   >It would add a $300 per week federal unemployment insurance supplement through mid-March. The plan would also extend the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs, which expanded jobless benefits eligibility and allowed people to continue to receive payments after their state assistance ran out, through mid-March.  ==   >The bill would put $284 billion into Paycheck Protection Program loans, which can be forgiven, and allow hard-hit small businesses to draw a second round of funding. It would include $20 billion in grants for companies in low-income areas and money set aside for loans from community-based and minority-owned lenders.  ==  >The package would send direct payments of $600 to most Americans — down from the $1,200 passed in March as part of the CARES Act. Families will also get $600 per child. Individuals who earned up to $75,000 per year and couples who made up to $150,000 in 2019 will receive the full sum. The payments will phase out until they stop for individuals and couples who made $99,000 and $198,000, respectively. Mixed-status households, in which a member of the family does not have a Social Security number, will also receive payments, retroactive to the CARES Act.  === >The bill would extend the federal eviction moratorium through Jan. 31. It would put $25 billion into a rental assistance fund, which state and local governments would allocate to people to use for past due and future rent or utilities payments.  === >It would phase out emergency Federal Reserve lending powers established by the CARES Act at the end of the year, and repurpose $429 billion in unused funds. A proposal backed by GOP Sen. Pat Toomey to prevent the Fed from setting up “similar” programs in the future temporarily tripped up the final push to craft a rescue package. The parties eventually settled on language that would not allow the Fed to set up identical lending provisions.|2020-12-21 10:49:22

SRNE's stake went from 100m to 160m just now, and SRNE hasn't moved. When DARPA gave $34m funding to SRNE a month or so ago, stock shot up like 20%.   Couple that with the unusual options activity last Monday ([take a look what happened last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fl38vh/question_about_unusual_options_activity_does_it/) \- went from $1.8 when I posted that to almost $20 within couple months).

gmfpjb|khf71h|khf71h|3|**Last time posting this before DD post after work:**   Expecting SRNE at $8+ this week, 12+ by Jan 15. Will post DD later today.  SRNE owns 10m shares of ImmunityBio, which just merged with NK Pharma (which is also up 60% today). SRNE's stake went from 100m to 160m just now, and SRNE hasn't moved. When DARPA gave $34m funding to SRNE a month or so ago, stock shot up like 20%.  Couple that with the unusual options activity last Monday ([take a look what happened last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fl38vh/question_about_unusual_options_activity_does_it/) \- went from $1.8 when I posted that to almost $20 within couple months). The options purchased on Monday were 10x greater in $ than the ones in March.  Source for SRNE ownership of shares:    [https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11421/html](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11421/html)  Do a quick Ctrl+F search for 'License Agreement with NantCell'  NantCell = ImmunityBio  Search for 'In April 2015, the Company and NantCell, Inc. (which subsequently changed its name to ImmunityBio, Inc.) ', you'll see that NantCell = ImmunityBio.  SRNE owns 10m shares, which gained 60% value today (so $100m --> $160m), yet SRNE barely budged.  &#x200B;  **Positions:** SRNE $10 1/15c. DD coming.|2020-12-21 14:55:51

gm5dbs|khf71h|khf71h|3| In 2010, as the Federal Reserve continued its quantitative easing program, Buffett warned that same year, “We are following policies that unless changed will eventually lead to lots of inflation down the road.”  He added, “We have [started down a path](http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/05/news/economy/Fed_quantitative_easing/index.htm) you don’t want to go down.”  As  the markets sank in the past two weeks, headlines suggested that the  end of the central bank easy money era was finally “sinking in.” At the  2013 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Buffett had already warned, **“QE  is like watching a good movie, because I don’t know how it will end.  Anyone who owns stocks will reevaluate his hand when it happens, and  that will happen very quickly.”**|2020-12-21 13:29:47

If your top 3 holdings don’t take up at least 40% of your portfolio save yourself some time and invest in VOO. Stop fucking cutting your winners short and letting losses ride.

gli3zi|khf71h|khf71h|4|June we broke the /ES 20 daily sma and fell further to find the 50, then 100, but the lines were still a bit crossed from March. September and October same story, broke the 20 to fins 50 and 100. Today we're sitting below the 20. We would need a strong close to reclaim \~3670 to get back to the other side and preserve a confident bull case. This morning we bounced to that level and found no buyers. Hard to tell yet if we'll repeat trends but if you're long need to consider 3550 (50) and 3460 (100). The lower level is only a 7% drop from the highs. Of course these were all during times of a lot more uncertainty. Just some long term thots on targets if internals continue to look like shit. Overextended, sell the news, profit taking, rebalancing, mutation, GA elections, all crap here to ruin your trendies|2020-12-21 10:16:20

glagke|khf71h|khf71h|6|Guys its so fucking obvious whats going on with PLTR. There are way too many paper hands in it unlike any other stock ive seen. Heres what my theory is: bag holders are pumping PLTR propaganda here to get people to buy the dips and then the bagholders panic sell when it goes up 3%. Then the cycle repeats: The people that bought the dips realize they were fooled and it creates a second generation of bagholders, who pump up the PLTR propaganda to WSB in hope of a nother 3% day then they panic sell for a loss.  The cycle repeats, creating a society full of PLTR bagholders looking to con the next man into holding their bag. The PLTR hype simply does not match its results.

gl763s|khf71h|khf71h|6|4 weeks ago I lent someone 50 bucks. He got hit by 2020 pretty hard and told me he needs money to get food. This scumbag was supposed to give back the money beginning of December. Saturday I finally told him that I will go to his place on Monday or Tuesday in order to get my money. He now threatens me and told me that he decides when I can get my money back. I do not care about 50 as I make more on a Daily basis of course. But what really hits me is that the purpose of helping someone can show you how bad people can be. That is sad and I am too blue eyed obviously. Sorry for OT. Just needed to tell someone.

Search for 'In April 2015, the Company and NantCell, Inc. (which subsequently changed its name to ImmunityBio, Inc.) ', you'll see that NantCell = ImmunityBio.  SRNE owns **10m shares, which gained 60% value today (so $100m --> $160m), yet SRNE barely budged.**  When **SRNE** got $34m in DARPA funding, it went up 20%. Wonder what gaining $60m in equity in a day will do?  &#x200B;  Oh, interestingly, the Chairman of the merger company is the CEO who SRNE has a $1billion arbitration with currently.  &#x200B;  Reading between the lines...

This will push it up to $20 EOW (shorts covering, event driven investors getting in).  Sherman, scared by Cohen's big dick energy, issues the new shares. This is more or less priced in after the earnings call, but let's say the stock then falls to $18.  With all of GME's ammo utilised, Cohen buys more shares. Burry and Cohen become directors and turn the company around.  Good news from console sales and a great Q4 ER causes the stock to rocket to $50 by March.  Life is good 🚀🚀🚀|2020-12-21 08:26:48

glt4t7|khf71h|khf71h|-9|There are a shockingly large amount of people in here who clearly have 0 experience with trends, technical analysis, or even basic fundamental methods of valuation. People who think "stonks only go up" or "nothing limits the stocks price, it can go to X or Y (cough cough, Tesla)" and nothing can stop it. Fundamentals ABSOLUTELY matter people. Every bubble you've seen in history has done the same thing. When will the herd learn? You sheeple do the same thing every time. Why not be one of the contrarians who actually wins? The top is near. Market reversal is going to be coming early next year (think mid january- early February as the start). There's a chance for some real money to be made. But most of you will be playing long positions and get completely toasted. Whatever, my tendiez have to come from somewhere so I thank you for your sacrifice.|2020-12-21 11:49:28
