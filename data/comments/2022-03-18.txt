16dkwi|tgxv5v|tgxv5v|16|Since 🌈🐻s are whining about how there is no bull case, here are some reasons why I'm bullish:  * Record excess household savings. * Millennials cohort 29-49 reaching prime earnings + leverage age have not yet peaked and won't for a few years. * 7 rate hikes have already been priced in and uncertainty about Fed monetary moves has largley been removed. * System still flush with liquidity, cash and debt are trash and will still be crushed nominal basis by stocks. Everyone hates the market but TINA "there is no alternative" still. * Tons of tickers priced stupid cheap still such as insurance companies single digit PEs, benefiting from hikes, banks just above book value (also good with hikes), consumer staples many cheap.  * Passive ETF investing still record high, like a steamroller keeps adding money to the market in 401ks, retirement plans, pensions, etc. * Many megacaps have extraordinary monopoly power, arguably way more than last few economic cycles * YoY SPY is still green and still nominally crushing cash + debt. * Stocks typically rise during geopolitical tensions. * Periods of elevated VIX tends to produce higher than average returns * If you're betting against SPY, you're betting against MSFT, AAPL and GOOGL. These companies have shown NO signs of slowing growth which is why they continue to trade at elevated PEs. You can't stop SPY if these three companies don't take bigger hits. BRK.B is just AAPL and cash at this point. FB and NFLX have already seen massive corrections.  * Lots of stocks have already corrected over 50%, and not all of them are high PE Cathie stocks.  * Unemployment is very low right now and I don't see us going back over 4% anytime soon. * Earnings and GDP growth are still strong.|2022-03-18 12:18:37

16up9p|tgxv5v|tgxv5v|11|This was my thought before FOMC and it still applies:  > The puts right before fomc rate hike announcement trade tomorrow is too crowded. Market will pump to shake out the weak hands and everyone's going to be saying "it was priced in retard." The options positioning is currently short-delta heavy. Since it's extreme put-heavy going into OPEX, a drop in vol after a large event vol (if there's no hawkish surprise like a 50bps hike) could trigger de-risking into opex, driving positive delta hedge covering flows. Then after the gamma roll off and unwinding has dissipated, it can reaccelerate lower as puts get bought again the following weeks.  Bears keep saying "nothing has changed, fed was hawkish, inflation is still high" but they don't understand the mechanics of the market and how the options market can drive equities. Bulls who are up big should take some off the table before close today to be safe. Next week could see a big drop before the end of quarter rebalancing following week|2022-03-18 14:12:01

Technically too we are at resistance around 440 with a lot of room below us to pull back into so it would be a logical place to see at least a temporary reversal|2022-03-18 10:29:59

15kjwy|tgxv5v|tgxv5v|2|Look, I hate Chinese stocks as much as everyone else, but sometimes you have to put your feelings aside and ride the wave.  CCP has clearly de-risked ADRs and basically said that they are allowed.  They are capitulating wrt following SEC rules.  That whole issue is years away anyway.    In the years that the CCP has to nominate a chairman, MCHI usually goes up by 30+%.  Guess what?  Xi needs to be re-nominated this year.  CCP always follows the same pattern over and over again.  Just prior to renomination years, CCP shows that they're tough and in charge. They clamp down on business the year before re-nominations to flex that they have power.  Then they start pulling back when business pulls back too much and then pump the markets right before nominations to placate the masses prior to leadership being put back in charge.  Now is a terrible time to bet against Chinese stocks. They've already been hammered for over a year.  Not much downside risk at this point (imo), and mostly huge upside potential.|2022-03-18 09:07:01

Depending on how much it moved while you were holding the pure long position, this can allow you to take like 50-80% equity off the table as profit while still remaining exposed to continued upside and turning the position into a theta-positive play that you can just let appreciate thru expiration (often times risk free relative to p/l before entering the initial longs)|2022-03-18 10:25:23

What happens to people short a stock when that stock gets delisted? **They don’t need to cover.**  Also, it takes around 1-2 weeks to sell shares that have been DRS’d. Good luck selling on the off chance that it does MOASS.  Apes are actually helping the hedge funds, but yeah keep DRSing.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯|2022-03-18 11:45:44

156wr7|tgxv5v|tgxv5v|-8| My (28F) boyfriend (30M) has become an “AMC ape”. Red flag or overthinking?  I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a year and I’ve always known he was into stocks. He’s also a pretty competitive person. When the GME short squeeze happened in January and then the AMC one in June, I think he felt he missed out. He put a lot of money into AMC in July, when it was high. When he first did it, I thought it was just one of many plays he was in, so I listened to what he said about it and was interested. Now I’m starting to realize it’s an obsession.  He calls himself an ape, and again I thought he meant it as a joke but it seems he’s serious. He often listens to Twitter spaces about AMC, and the people seem to me like they’re in a cult. If anyone calls in even suggesting that they don’t agree with their analysis, they get shouted down. My boyfriend has a Twitter complete with AMC in his bio and the green laser eyes in his profile picture.  I’ve asked him about his interest in AMC many times to try to understand it. I try to bring it up very casually and in a non judgmental way so that he doesn’t get defensive. I’ve learned that he has 100k+ in AMC, although he claims he has other savings as well. Still, that seems pretty reckless to me and makes me worry that we don’t have the same view of money. Recently I’ve been seeing him like things on Twitter like a video saying that anyone who questions AMC, whether it’s your parents, friends, or partner, is FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and you should ignore them at all costs because this is a war. He has also said things to me about how the mainstream media is lying to us to help the hedge funds, and will tell me “news” that are untrue when I read mainstream sources. For example, he said that the delta variant is being overhyped by the media to distract from an inevitable stock market crash.  I am trying to figure out why this bothers me so much, and I think it’s a combination of things:      It’s important to me to share political views with my partner and when we met we were both Democrats. I think he still is but some of the things he says (like the above) sound like something a trump supporter would say.      I’m also worried because he currently lives with his parents and wants to move out and buy a house, which is important to me because it would allow us more freedom in the relationship. However, I am worried that if he’s always waiting for the AMC short squeeze, he won’t ever take his money out to buy a house.      I am starting to doubt his judgment and whether we will be able to see eye to eye on big issues. When I ask (in a curious, non judgmental way) how technical analysis works or even something like options trading, he gives an answer that doesn’t sound correct based on my research. It worries me that he is betting 100k on something that he doesn’t understand enough to explain.  I know I have a tendency to overthink and jump to conclusions. Steer me straight: is this a big enough red flag to justify a potential breakup, or just a hobby I shouldn’t worry about?  TL; DR: boyfriend put 100k into AMC stock and thinks that anyone who doubts it will “moon” is just trying to spread fear.|2022-03-18 07:17:05

14xhjl|tgxv5v|tgxv5v|-15|gme's whole float to be DRS'd by 2 years maximum conservatively, yet theres so much bearish sentiment here LMAO. wonder how many are shills and are actually truly dumb.  they announced theyre releasing their nft marketplace by the end of 2nd quarter 2022 so by july and nfts is the biggest growing industry right now. if they truly become a market leader in the nft market, which already makes billions a year, they could have a mkt cap easily of at least 500b, or 5k a share. id say even 1t mkt cap could be possible or 10k. 950 calls will print retirement money for when this happens by 2 years. the vw short squeeze made it briefly the most valuable company in the world which would be about 30k for a gme share if u compare mkt cap. anyone bearish on something this value is truly just an imbecile, good luck shorting it nerds|2022-03-18 05:33:13
