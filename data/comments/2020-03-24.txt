ldcwtw|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|76|Ok boys, class time - in every bear market, there’s the drop as everyone rushes to the exits as the future suddenly looks uncertain. A nuclear bomb going off in a sudden flash.   There is then the rally when everyone thinks we have to have priced in this risk, those in power are going to handle this thing and everything will return to normal. This is the culmination of the “buy the dip” wisdom and is like air rushing in after the nuclear bomb detonates.   What everyone who wasn’t a part of ‘08 or have recently come to WSB from r/all needs to understand is that bear markets have a third phase, one which destroys everyone equally- the long, drawn out bleeding. This part lasts the longest and makes everyone miserable. Bulls because the dip becomes the chasm becomes the crack to the core. Bears because volatility dies down as the lifeless corpse stops twitching as violently. This is when people decide that the rally will never come again. News anchors will start talking about “fundamental shifts in how the market is being valued.” This is radiation from the blast, come to slowly drain the life from everything it touches.   TL;DR: bears, wait a day or two and when the rally starts fading, buy longer and lower dated puts. Bulls, enjoy your last glimpses of the sun before nuclear winter sets in.|2020-03-24 09:58:38

lec11i|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|20|The Dow Jones industrial average’s gain of 9.3% today would put it in the top 10 best days on the index, if those gains hold.  However, ***six of those days came during the Great Depression and its aftermath.*** In the last 50 years only the global financial crisis and Black Monday come anywhere close.  The S&P 500 is on track to its strongest day since... the 13 March 2020. However, the current 7.9% gain would also be right up there in the record books, rivalled only by the rebounds from those other market crashes.  *(The S&P 500 is younger than the Dow Jones, tracing its origins merely to 1926 rather than 1885, but it is much preferred by professional investors because it is weighted to the companies’ market values and tracks more companies.)*|2020-03-24 15:24:36

ldnqib|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|19|I’m only going to say this once. If you need my diligence, read through my past posts and comments.  Your puts, regardless of when they were purchased, so long as they expire April 15 or later, are all safe. This is a bounce, not a rally upwards. We aren’t even half way through this mess yet. We haven’t seen credit agencies downgrading yet, we haven’t seen many analyst downgrades, companies are yet to miss bond and loan payments, and unemployment is just starting to roll.  Ha. Don’t be a fucking autistic fool. No matter how OTM your puts are, their extrinsic value is likely as low as it’s going to get. If you can hold through today, and likely tomorrow, by next week your losses will be halved.|2020-03-24 11:43:08

lekiz1|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|16|Remember when Bush passed the stimulus bill in January 2008 to $1.2k to qualifying couples and $600 to individuals. Guess what happened? The market tanked until it hit rock bottom on March 2009. Look at the charts. Market hits bottom 12-13 months following a fiscal stimulus bill (seriously look at the charts and articles). Retail investors are going to get cucked. Wall Street Giants are already buying puts. Look at the volume on puts. They're allowing the retards from Twitter and r/all (look at the comments) to buy in to the government saving them. Once it gets high enough to make puts cheap. They sell all their shares. Everyone laughed at $SPY $200 when we were at $SPY $280 *hint* *hint*. The feds know they're checkmate (Unlimited QE, brrrrrr) but they don't understand why the market is not "dipping" and going up. Why else would they go full $YOLO on the economy? They fucked up and they know. Trump is doing these weak ass pressers to get the smooth brains to buy in the "dip". You know what? I am dancing. I see an opportunity to make it big in this country even if it means taking the money off of boomers 401k's. History has reputation of repeating itself. There's a fire and the feds are telling us to put an air fan on the smoke detector   *The only thing you're going to regret is that you didn't buy more*  Summary: Buy long puts and look at the pump to end all pumps  P.S look at the boomers at Yahoo Finance.

leab3q|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|11|Today was the type of move you see in a short-term bottom; the up day was bigger than the previous down day.  Today's upside move was 50% larger than yesterday's down move.  All of the previous huge up moves were just reactions that barely matched their immediate prior downside moves.  Obviously, the reason is the $1.5 trillion stimulus combined with Trump wanting people back to work by Easter and Italy's coronavirus rates of death/cases decelerating.  We're still in a bear market, but this bounce could be the start of a multi-day/multi-week move so I would advise against immediately trying to short every bounce which worked the past couple of weeks.    This is the part of the bear market where things are more likely to move sideways with a lean upwards until we get clarity on when another down leg will come into play.  The bigger focus now will be on NY and other states to see how the coronavirus develops.  If Trump lets people back to work/gathering too soon, then we may end up with another big wave of infections in May.|2020-03-24 15:09:07

Really the best and we need to support them.   We will not be shutting things down. We have the best economy. The best businesses. The Merican economy is strong and we are back open for business. We are totally back open for business and we will get businesses going after this awful disease, it’s a disease, also a virus, but this virus disease, once we beat it means American business will be back open. I can’t say how long it’ll be before we beat this Chinese flu but the best- the best- people are telling me it’s going to be soon and then business will be back open. America will be open for business. We opened for business yesterday. The night before yesterday we opened for business. I signed an order directing the eradication of the disease. The disease virus.   What will also be opening are those two ships. We have ships coming to New York, the Misery and the Comfort. It’ll be in New York harbor but it was going through massive maintenance so it’ll be there soon. Great people working to fix the ship. Great. But also in Los Angeles. There are two ships. Two ships. Great ships. Perfect for the people of New York. I’m talking to Governor Cuomo daily. Great people in New York.   We will make it through this and I am taking all the necessary actions. We are taking strong leadership. I’m leading this and we are doing perfect. Great. We are doing perfectly great.   Now for some questions. You, you’re too close to the other guy there but I’ll take your question.   “Mr. President what risks are business taking on by having to take action without any specific guidance from the government?”   What a ridiculous question. Does it make you feel good to be so nasty? Huh? I’m leading this and there are two ships going to help people. Two ships going to help Americans and Azzins. American Azzins. Great people. Really great people. Honest Americans not like reporters. So we are doing great things. Perfect things and I’m leading this.   “Mr. President, the fatality rates in New York have skyrocketed. Since you’re leading these efforts what are you doing for New Yorkers?”   Ask Governor Cuomo, he’s leading this. It’s his failures that caused these people to die. I’m doing a perfect job.

Soviets painted over cracked infrastructure, we're painting over deeply deeply flawed aspects of capitalism.  With infinite QE are we even in a real free market anymore?

ldh8c3|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|8| I've been trading and daytrading for the past week and every single move I've made has been wrong. Like, drastically. I bought into the JNUG call-buying retardation last week for 10k and lost it in 36 hours when it slid like 90% and kept trying to average down as it plummeted into the fiery depths of hell. Bought SBUX puts two days ago and got railed, bought SBUX calls earlier today and got fucking railed. Bought LYV puts, sold too early, bought LYV puts again at the spike, got fucking merc'd. Just getting curveball'd left and right. Anyways, I'll throw at least 1k at any option play you guys comment below and play it exactly as you call it. Give me a strike price and a date, preferably a sell date and I'll rip it in and post updates as I likely body more losses. Got 25k left for plays so here we go... Cheers|2020-03-24 10:41:19

ldujap|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|8|Some wisdom taken from investing.com's retarded chat.  To all the bears out there shouting 1800, 1500. I've been there 5 years ago when my local market had a beautiful waterfall. It felt like this could go on forever and I could hit the goal that I was setting that would rake me over 500K profit. Then suddenly without any positive news the market took a major V shape reversal. I  couldn't except it.. calling it manipulations and short term. I honestly can't predict what this is we are seeing now (if you are right then hats off to ya) but a word of concision, don't be trap in your own bias. Go with the flow. Trust me I've been there. I've lost over 50,000 of gain during the downfall and all my capitals at the time.. I hope my story can save some of you from experiencing the same fate. Go with the flow my friends  what was the reason for your previous bear position.  The market was following the China shock back in 2015. It was the SET index in Thailand and Coup was happening + the King was dying. Everything was set for the perfect storm so I went all in. I made huge gain within a couple of weeks. Then suddenly the market rebounded 5% intra day. But I didnt believe it, there is nothing to support the rebound. So I shorted the bounce but it just won't go down. At the end I lost it all. It was a very expensive lesson.|2020-03-24 12:46:22

Google Weimar Republic inflation.   When you turn on the Federal Reserve printing presses you have to keep markets open to have a check on the fed and make sure things are being priced semi reasonably. Otherwise you have a printer turned on with no one accurately assessing how much is being printed.   Then you wake up to an inflation nightmare.|2020-03-24 06:18:48

ldz1rw|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|10| My understanding of what is happening RIGHT NOW:  Repo operations are liquidity injections through cheap artificial loans required to keep the economy going with actual $$$ ( hence Fed's slow balance sheet growth due to interest % and a non-perfect exchange)  Quantitative Easing is straight up Fed balance sheet growth thorough asset acquisition (artificial market demand preventing price discovery)  Combined = collapse of volatility as well as a surge in asset valuations and return to the norm that... "StOnKs Go Up! ThIs Is InVeStInG"  Furthermore, performing such actions mentioned above by printing of non-resource backed fiat currency, equates to a long term devaluation of the underlying. Thus creating inflation for said currency.  This counter acts the "flight-to-safety" Fiat devaluation we are experiencing at present as well as true realized asset losses from actual price discovery.  Historically however, the FED has always reacted to the economy late. So by the time they realize the consequences of their actions it probably will overshoot to the other side of the coin with an absolutely ass-ripping bull market run combined with possible collapse of the dollar's purchasing power.  Some where in all this mess it will find a happy medium ensuring the middle class completely disappears forever.  This is my limited understanding and in no way, shape, or form is this advice or an investment thesis for anyone. Fair Disclosure.|2020-03-24 13:28:09

ldyj2y|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|11|I'd just like to point out a comparison of USA to Italy infections according to John Hopkins (because we cannot trust China data).  https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html  At the moment of writing this, Italy has 69,176 infections and a population of 64.2 million per the CIA world Factbook. This is slightly above a 0.01% infection rate, and Italy is still having exponential growth in their # of infections.  Experts suggest we are about two weeks behind Italy. Assuming that we go into mass quarantine like Italy, and assuming same rate of infection as Italy, with a population of 330,000,000 the USA should have about 335,577 infections in two weeks. With Italy's current infection to death ratio per John Hopkins of about 10%, that means we will have 33,550 deaths if we institute mass quarantine right now.  If we do not institute mass quarantine in major cities (maybe rural communities are ok), our health care system is going to get over-run. I'm worried that the president is too worried about the economy, so he will not mass quarantine everyone. And I am fearful that today's rally will make him think that the stock market will go up if he tries to lift the work restrictions (which he cannot do, the governors are in charge) but he may pressure the governors to do so.  Edit: The mortality rate in Italy is about 10%, not 1%. I edited the math above.|2020-03-24 13:23:24

Yea, though I walk through the valley of trillions in debt,  I will fear no losses: for thou art with me;  Thy plunge protection team and thy zero-bound interest rates they comfort me.  Thou preparest unearned income before me in the presence of mine enemies:  Thou anointest my head with currency; my bank accounts runneth over.

Reducing corporate taxes by a LOT.   (c) Companies do stock buybacks with the extra money, like it's **free candy**.   (d) People see stocks only going up.   (e)  Stocks only go up.  (f) Trump sees stocks going only up by TOO MUCH.   "Oh no!  I'd better save some of this sweet syrupy sweetness for my November 2020! reee erection" and starts **artificially depressing the US economy** using the old "Tariffs on Chinese Goods" trick  (g) Stocks waffle near SPY 293 for years and years  (h) Trump gets very distracted by his imp peach mint trial, and **forgets** to keep applying downward pressure on stocks with more tariffs  (i) Stocks accidentally go up to All Time High on February 19 2020.  (j) Oops!  Killer virus threatens to kill 2 percent of entire world.

ldnpf6|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|5|The reason why this is different from all the previous other +5% up days is that today is not just a reflex bounce to a single big down day like the other +5% up days were since they all followed huge -5% days.  Most of those bounces simply negated a single day's negative action.  This is not like any of those, it's a much larger bounce.  That's why I expect this to be a much larger bounce than any we've seen the past 2 weeks.  This is looking like the setup for a multi-day/multi-week bounce.  I would not be trying to time puts here, let the market run for a couple days or even a week or two, markets might have shifted to buying on bad news for the next 2 weeks.|2020-03-24 11:42:51

ldb0sr|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|8|Bought 10 spy puts at 235 exp. 4/20 when the underlying was 235. I think this was a good move considering that:  1. I bought it after the drop in volatility.  2. I bought it close to the peak.  3. Clearly, the price is unsustainable and I think it will return to at least 230 in the next few days or one week. I used the RSI to make this decision. 4. I have little faith that the Senate will actually vote AND pass the stimulus on Thursday, considering gridlock.    If the profit I see is 10-20%, I'll take it happily.

ldugfm|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|8|She said we’re seeing about a 10% infection rate across the country. That means if we *maintain* that infection rate, 30 million people will/already have contracted the virus. If the death rate stays at 3%, which has been a fairly consistent number for the past number of weeks, that means we will see around 1 million deaths.    That’s 1 million deaths that are already “priced in” to the total. If Trump seriously says the country is ready to return to normal in two weeks, that number will rocket.

Sure they acquired some new shares and said “We don’t want the gov. To take equity” however that doesn’t change their financial situation in the slightest. This goes for the economy too.  I’d think twice before jumping onto this with calls; just my take though, I’d make some longer dates puts. -glad I sold my puts this week though; these pumps aren’t based in reality.|2020-03-24 09:30:24

lde5m1|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|6|I'll be honest...I think the market will take atleast 9-12 months to recover. However, if you think this is going much further down, I've got bad news for you. We already went down almost 35%.  Even if the market took a year to get back, do you really think the average company is worth 65% of its pre-crash value?  You need to understand how time value of money works. Even with the most valuable year (being the front one) of the potentially unlimited years of money making a company has is taken out, they aren't going to be even close to only 65% of value. In a 10%/year market, this is barely 9.1% loss, actuarial speaking. Now,  I understand there are many different factors that can contribute to a recession and in our case we've had one of the longest bull markets in history the last 11 years.  However, I personally believe (and hope) the virus will start to slow down and become contained. It will be a mere after thought in 1 year's time when we have vaccines available and nearly everyone is back to work. I just don't see this dropping much more. Maybe another 10%? But hey...keep buying your FD puts if you really want to|2020-03-24 10:11:21

At some point number will decline here as well. California cases are also declining.  On the other hand, seems like situation in India is getting worst which would be a huge blow across the globe.  There MAY be a light at the end of the tunnel but me thinks still some room for a downward trend. But outlook is slightly better than a week ago.  Once Europe cases decline, there will be a week or two where cases in US and Indi spike and after that Europe, US and China India will slowly recover while most cases will grow in less developed countries.

It’s currently at $425, and this is all I have left in my account. Do I hold till tomorrow and hope for another rally after the relief bill passes, or do I act rationally and take gains to wait for another opportunity  Edit: just sold at $432. You guys are right, it was way too risky to hold, and now I’m hoping to build my account back to what it was before I blew it up :). Thanks guys|2020-03-24 14:31:46

ldglyw|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|4|Hope noobies recognize today that nothing said on these discussion boards should be taken seriously because it’s just a bunch of salty retards throwing shit at a wall and seeing if it sticks. For the eight of you with enough cognitive functionality to check your IVs, you get to see that it has actually gone up, congratulations! Now you understand that the 6 thousand idiots telling you IV is going to LEVEL OUT after a 5% JUMP PREMARKET literally have absolutely no clue what they are talking about. Every week has been a shit show and every week people will start screaming that it’s over now. Nope, not over, not even slightly. There will be days where being very bearish or very bullish can make you a ton of money, but not a single one of the people on this sub can confidently say that shutting down entire countries for multiple weeks and measures being put in place every day will some how magically level things out.   If you are on here telling people how the market will react, I hope (which you won’t) that when you go back and check on the positions you pussied out on because you’re weak, and see they are making just as much if not more money later in the week, that you also feel bad you probably lost someone stupider that you’s money because you wanted to justify your confirmation bias.   TLDR: Read DD on this sub and follow if you want. Not comments. The people in these comments are the 99% majority mouth breathers|2020-03-24 10:35:23

led8gm|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|4|Okay, I hold $18k worth of put from yesterday that I rage bought. I deleted RH app and not checking, but I think I lost 50% today. Having said that, I think perhaps the bottom is in for now. I really doubted separate-variation, but I think he's right on that original post that we will have rest of week of rallying to 250 to perhaps 270.  Current sentiment, specially after Trump saying he wants to open up economy by Easter makes it feel like we hit the bottom. The deaths and COVID-19 confirmation cases are rising. However, these are usually lagging behind. These people were contracted before all the lockdown/quarantines. Since we are having severe lock downs since late last week, I think we will start seeing drop in daily cases in 2~3 weeks. What I am saying is it is likely stock market already priced in the peak and things daily cases will go down after 3 weeks.  Once that happens around Easter, I think Trump can go and say we are in control and market might continually go up.  I still hold 4/24 put so I am holding. But I think I made a mistake but gonna sink with the ship. Maybe things will get worse, but I think we won't have same problem as Italy, where we start seeing 500+ death daily. For SPY to drop to 182, I think we need to be Italy 2.0. I dont think Trump is that stupid to allow US to be like Italy. I just hope that we see some drops so that I can get out with maybe -30% or less loss.|2020-03-24 15:35:42

lcxg56|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|2|So we’ve seen multiple instances of fed action, the quarantine/lockdown ending in Wuhan (happened overnight), and We’ve seen a lot of new floors. We can’t fall forever. It really really looks like some asset class values have reached a bottom range (oil, bonds, stock) or even a top one (VXX).     I’m down on all of my short positions, but I feel totally comfortable waiting for chances to close before the end of this week but in all honesty once the daily news s reports that coronavirus cases are starting to decrease, I will hope to be closed out and ready to reverse. Oh, also oil will never stay this low. Russia and SA need it at 40$ & 60$ a barrel respectively to maintain a balanced budget.

Granted still just under 52 week lows now, they will have incredible Q1/Q2 and even better years. Scripts are at record highs, people making sure to have their medicine. Most employ less than 250 people. All US based. All small cap pharmas, I’m not giving individual recommendations  Allergies, hormonal, gene therapies. All will still be used  Plus FDA are really pushing out a lotta medicine and new guidelines. All beautiful for small caps, making it much easier to proceed with their work|2020-03-24 13:25:15

My puts are almost worthless, and as such, I’ll take any extrinsic value I can get.  With that said, think this is a bounce and we haven’t found bottom. No clue how long this rally lasts, but think about the macro situation. Unemployment will continue to rise, companies will continue to miss revenue, both likely prolonged. Bond and loan payments will be missed, covenants will be defaulted, credit agencies will mass downgrade corporates, and bankruptcies will roll. The virus is currently brewing on the coasts of our nation. Why? Because our main ports of entry are here. There is no way that NYC gets as infected as it currently is, yet the rest of the country is hanging on. This thing will spread. As a Trump supporter, I think he is dead wrong trying to rush everyone back to work so that the economy doesn’t completely sputter. But then again, his second term is absolutely dependent on this economy fixing itself.  What a mess, but TLDR; I don’t believe we’ve found bottom.  Think the retail investors will get raped off this bounce, but then again maybe I’m wrong and I’m the real retail investor that the institutions prey off of. Only time will tell.|2020-03-24 09:21:35

That means the worst will be in the rearview in 3 weeks, give or take. After that, business can slowly begin to resume. Yes, a month or two of lockdown will hurt the economy, it already has.

The virus continues to play out in the background but doesn't get to record numbers or start a Spanish Flu level apocalypse, because places like Japan exist that have far underwhelmed the projections. It becomes something like the Swineflu back in '09, mortality rate is a bit higher, but business carries on as usual.  What other substantial thing is there that will keep us in a true recession?? In this scenario, how would the downward spiral continue from a 2 week pause that is then supported by these stimulus bills?|2020-03-24 14:23:16

The unemployment numbers are before March 14th and by the time current numbers are out they’ll seem like a thing of the past.

lcytqf|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|0|Italy numbers not increasing as fast as previous days is bullish along with Trump wanting to pull back on suppression measures by next week.  And of course there's the $1.5-2 trillion stimulus package which Congress will pass this week.  All of it combined with how fast the market dropped this past month sets us up for a huge/fast counterrally.  The question is how sustainable this is: I think we might see a multi-week bounce out of this as long as NY is the only major uncontrolled outbreak in the US.  Of course, if we really do pull back on suppression measures without testing far more people, then we set ourselves up for another wave of coronavirus cases by late April/early May, so that's the bad news that could eventually pop up...|2020-03-24 07:07:38

This isn't the end of the world. This is the actual dead cat bounce. We'll probably reach a bottom in September but thinking it will just keep going down forever in a straight line is insane, the last month tricked you.  That's not to say it's going to be a big green dildo right to the top of the retracement, my guess is 50% from bottom, it will be a saw type movement, up and down, up and down, but with an upward trend.  Short term options will be king as long as you get the right rhythm.|2020-03-24 10:05:20

ldk1wl|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|-8|Bears are grasping now. Gonna be a nice green week either way. Chloroquine data we should get an idea end of week, news about other drugs. Possible Italian peak, other Europe nations, China will be going back to business as usual shortly, better understanding of the virus, stimulus bill. All this is uncertain that will be clarified in the coming weeks. It’s gonna get worse but the market can do math and knows if we have 400 deaths then easily 300-600k infected at current death rates. You will get the people panicking but the people with big money are buying here. I don’t even trade indexes, only pharma mostly. The biggest bear defense is not enough ventilators, PPE. Which can be fixed by Trump using the defense act at his next meeting. Unlikely but hospital overflow will be bad|2020-03-24 11:08:20

ldenag|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|-4|I'd hold off on getting puts here.  Yes, we haven't had multiple positive days in a row since early Feb, but the amount of positive news ($1.5+ trillion stimulus and Trump wanting to ease restrictions soon as well as Italy's rate of cases/deaths decelerating) and the low level at which markets were at yesterday mean that we could be in for a prolonged bounce here.  This is looking like yesterday was A bottom and we're going to experience 2-3 weeks of upward movement.  That means even if we see escalating case/death numbers in the US, we could see markets buying instead of selling on the coronavirus news.  The only thing that makes me hesitant in saying that the worst is completely behind us is that in early May we could see a big second wave of US infections if the US eases up on restrictions in early April.  But that means you have plenty of time to load up on puts in mid-April at higher levels.|2020-03-24 10:16:17

ldbh8t|fo3bjb|fo3bjb|-6|Can someone explain to me why my 220 put expiring tomorrow didn’t sell yet? I told Robinhood to sell it before the market opened this morning. At that time volume was over 4,000 and now volume is over 11,000. Why isn’t my stupid put selling?  Edit: stupid Reddit let’s me reply 1 comment every 10 minutes. I am really novice so I apologize for my ignorance. That’s why I’m here asking you people who are much smarter than me for help learning.   I bought it for $6 and try to sell it this morning for like 6.70 or something. I don’t know how to sell these I’ve now learned. What are the different ways (limit vs market?) and how do I set price? Is there a way to set price so it remains competitive until it’s sold (ie it keeps dropping in price as the stock changes)?   Lastly, I’m down almost the entire $600 at the moment, any chance you think I should wait till the end of today or just give up now and take my loss? I don’t fully understand time decay but the thing expires tomorrow. Should I just hold it till the end? Can I lose more than the $600 I’ve paid?|2020-03-24 09:44:01
