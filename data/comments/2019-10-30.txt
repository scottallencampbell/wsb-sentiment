5ss0i1|dp574l|dp574l|31|To all of our new degenerates here trying to gamble on FOMC here is how today usually plays out...  2pm - 215pm - Fed rate decision and statement.  There will be an initial move based on the Feds decision and statement. This usually results in the sub running around with their dicks hanging out screaming about bears/bulls being fucked, etc...*whatever you do, do not FOMO in at this point*  230pm - 3pm - JPow news conference...usually where the real move starts.  *much safer time to FOMO*  I think today spikes at the initial decision of a rate cut, gets a little chaotic as the statement is digested and then tanks when Powell starts talking about how strong the economy is.|2019-10-30 08:20:15

5sqopw|dp574l|dp574l|4|Alright, real question here...  I understand that a rate cut is a bad thing in general, and signals that the Fed thinks the economy is not doing well.  What I don't understand is the short term reaction, even being through it a bunch of times.  Last time we had the rate cut it was Sep 18, SPY opened around $300 and dipped to $298 before the meeting, and then it immediately jumped to $302.66 after the cut.  It then proceeded on a downward trend until hitting $284 exactly 2 weeks later on Oct 3.  Now I get that there was a lot of trade war talks not going well during this time, but are we to expecting to rally a bit before cooling off if they do cut?  I also don't see how no rate cut would be a bad thing, wouldn't it be business as usual?  What does no rate cut signal, shouldn't it increase investor confidence?|2019-10-30 08:02:24
