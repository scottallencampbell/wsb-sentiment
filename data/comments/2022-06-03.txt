Not quite enough to fully break the monitor and render it useless which would have allowed you to then take said monitor and throw it across the room because you would have had nothing to lose but just enough to scratch it noticeably without disabling the function. So you have to just pick it back up and now every time you look at that monitor for the foreseeable future, you see a nice little reminder of your emotional instability. Would be so incredibly silly to do something like that, I hope nobody in here is that dumb! Lol|2022-06-03 09:21:38

b1iwod|v3vzfw|v3vzfw|3|The first time you experience the forbidden parts of a woman, you feel like you are keeping a secret. Like you found the small brass key for someone's diary, with glossy cardboard binding and covers, and you read the pages no one has but her--maybe pages even she didn't read, just wrote. You want to scream these secrets to everyone around you, because, God, are they lovely. Soft and sweet and real and real. But you don't because that would be crude. Instead, you sneak a read of that diary again. Again and again. And hope she let's you read it again and again until you die.  SPY 380P 6/10|2022-06-03 09:43:58

Am I the only one on this page?  I see an insane inflation rate and rising interest rates coupled with ridiculous reverse repo, and reduced growth in the job sector.  We are so behind on the curve that a soft landing is just not feasible to me.  We have zero growth in the housing market in April which implies a potential housing market crash.  We have people who didn’t close on their homes who are now facing massively increased interest rates. Otherwise they have to back out of their home deals altogether and lose their deposits. And let’s talk about how many companies are so insanely overleveraged on their stock positions that it’s disgusting it was ever allowed to reach this point. (NICE JOB SEC, ENJOYING THE PRON?) Not just hedge funds, banks, major financial institutions. Now we’re talking about disallowing Chinese backed securities in the US stock exchange. Meanwhile, while I’ve been surfing Reddit and writing this. Some stocks are down almost 10% for the day. Seem normal? Everything just looks bad to me right now.  I hope I’m wrong to be honest.

Even Buffet sold his common shares in OXY at 20 before buying them back at 40 a year and a half later. I bought at 10.50 and sold at 60. I have been buying despac'd companies that are down 90 or so percent that have revenue, big cash piles, and hyper growth. Buying a spac at 10 dollars is stupid, buying at 2 or 1 dollars is much better.  One stock to small to name here is a spy satellite company associated with Peter Theil.

b1bg2g|v3vzfw|v3vzfw|6|What an epic bulltrap over the last 2 weeks. SNAP posted absolute dogshit earnings and got downgraded. It went up. MSFT posts terrible news regarding forward guidance that basically prepped people for a miss. It went up. That's how you know it was a bullshit rally in the middle of a bear market. So many companies reported margin challenges and missed on revs due to inflation, yet they tried to keep the narrative going that 'the consumer is strong'. OPEC fucked the world by increasing a microdrop of oil that won't replace Russia oil. $6 gas is coming and they keep trying to tell us the consumer has all sorts of pandemic savings left over that will bolster consumption. Yea fuggin' right, not with these gas, housing, and food costs. Then they tried to pump the market on the asinine idea that there will be a pause in rate hikes in Sept. Absolute insane copium. Just a shitty 2 week bull run in the middle of a bear market. We drill again, the bulls do a weak rally again, and then we drill down further. Bulls with stupid amounts of blinders on will get bled dry in this market slowly by bears. Bears are smarter in the way they work. Bleed 'em dry slowly and let them have their lil runs every so often.|2022-06-03 08:47:04

Same thing when a stock is way down people want to buy because it's low price but that means that other people have to sell how can there be pressure differences?|2022-06-03 15:00:25
