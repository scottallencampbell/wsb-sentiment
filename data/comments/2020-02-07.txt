gtdztv|f0902f|f0902f|7|China, second largest economy in the world. President Xi openly states that the nCov will have huge ramifications on their economy. Has also openly asked for world help, something China RARELY ever does; they know they can't hide the deaths fast enough. Over 70 million on lockdown with expected back to work next Monday. Hard to believe when they just locked down Guangzhou. But sure, let's maintain the narrative that they will miraculously go back to work. In response, China has responded by pumping 400bn into their markets as a stimulus. From -8.5% to green green green.    USA, world's largest economy, which depends extremely heavily on China, is still sitting at all time high. nCov has yet to make a dent. It did, but worries have already faded because FED repos defeat everything.    If Shenzhen closes over the weekend or on Monday for a week, expect fucking blood red across the board.

I don‚Äôt see us going below 320 even with virus escalation. Too many buyers still. Econ numbers great, virus shouldn‚Äôt be affecting our numbers for another month or two. But the street will adjust numbers to reflect that so still end up a beat. Nobody knows though, just bleeding for a rug pull is as old as time itself  Small caps getting fucked up too much.

Has also openly asked for world help, something China RARELY ever does; they know they can't hide the deaths fast enough. Over 70 million on lockdown with expected back to work next Monday. Hard to believe when they just locked down Guangzhou. But sure, let's maintain the narrative that they will miraculously go back to work. In response, China has responded by pumping 400bn into their markets as a stimulus. From -8.5% to green green green.   USA, world's largest economy, which depends extremely heavily on China, is still sitting at all time high. nCov has yet to make a dent. It did, but worries have already faded because FED repos defeat everything. Also election time. Trump will not let market fall back 5%. He will pull every string possible to keep the party going.

Trying to figure out if i should move some money from my tfsa to rrsp. You can take money out of tfsa when ever with no tax and rrsp you can for first home purchase and retirement. Then you get taxed when you retire. Ive been hearing that the gov is taking away tfsa once you hit 200k and tax you at marginal rate which is like 50%. Trying to decide if i should take 100k out of tfsa once i get to 120-150 and put in rrsp. Then i can take money out for my first home and do high risk option shit in rrsp till i retire.
