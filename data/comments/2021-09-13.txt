cov4ak|pncese|pncese|1|Here's the DD on TMC:   If the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls. If it's over $15 by Friday, MMs will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.        That's just September. Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...        So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls.
