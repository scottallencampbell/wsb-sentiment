If your account grows too big too fast it‚Äôs really easy for it to feel like fake money - so pull money from your account pay off credit cards or buy yourself a new dildo. After a big win or loss take a day off or do a small trade.   I took my $5k account to $40k to $20k to $44k to $2k and now to $20k (technically $10k since i took $10k out, first time taking profits).

With earnings this month, I do think there is still room for a good run up for tech, but who knows. Bulls, look for good deals on longer dated (30-45 DTE) calls/spreads.

xymeqi|hqcqy1|hqcqy1|3|TA update for y'all:  Looked at AMZN. Long term RSI is still pretty high, but MACD is crossing over which is a bearish signal imo. This is because there is a lot of stock action and that is causing the price to go down. I think this is massive movements of profit taking before earnings and before anything passes in congress.   These next few days, I do believe the market will be at a bit of a stand still. This means there are opportunities for bears, bulls, and the like. Look for signals or good plays in either direction.   I personally think that we will continue our trend upwards. Stimulus has not been passed yet, and we have not had a dip we have yet to overcome. We may meet resistance, but I think it will follow a "natural" flow, in that all variables contribute since the market is so vulnerable.|2020-07-13 14:41:14

xxb581|hqcqy1|hqcqy1|8|**An excerpt from my upcoming novel for gay Bears, *50 Shades of Red*:**  Our romance popped like a bubble. We had floated through the air together, magically and invisibly. Then in an instant, it was all over. Perhaps all affairs end suddenly? I wasn't sure, as this was my first.  I remembered our last conversation vividly. Painfully.  "We can't keep getting away with this." I gently wiped the sweat away from his forehead, his silver hair brushing the back of my fingers. "Elissa won't find out," I replied.   At my words he blinked and frowned slightly, "No, I mean this tech surge." What a fool I had been for assuming he was worried about our love.  He then stood, and his naked body went rigid. "It's too much. Too fast. Investors have their heads in the clouds with these cloud stocks." He grew louder, and his ass muscles flexed. "They don't even know what the cloud is!"   "And EV. EV! Fred Flintstone had a better looking car! Hot Wheels have generated more revenue! I begged him to help slow the feverish buying--to pump the brakes--but his Tweet wasn't enough..." He turned to me, a crazed look in his eye. "*In my opinion!*" I briefly was afraid of his maniacal laughter.  "There's no balance now! Amazon should rename itself Atlas. It carries the weight of the economic world! And even Titan gods can die!"  He dressed quickly, wordlessly, as I sat in stunned silence. Then he left, and I hadn't heard from him since.  Yes, our romance popped like a bubble. A stock market bubble.  **Previous excerpts:**    [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9nsx3/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_16_2020/fuyaotz/)  [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9nsx3/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_16_2020/fuz34x3/)  [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/habm91/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_17_2020/fv2vgme/)  [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haz16z/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_18_2020/fv6nole/)  [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hblxhj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_19_2020/fvahnpc/)  [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc7rvq/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_june/fver49c/)  [Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf8cor/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_25_2020/fvx8w58/)  [Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hkgjy6/daily_discussion_thread_for_july_03_2020/fwt096l/)|2020-07-13 07:57:01

xybpt6|hqcqy1|hqcqy1|3|Well to those asking why we are crashing, well it's quite simple. The sell off is coming from the uncertainty as earnings loom. No one is certain what is going to happen with earnings which is why there is so much put activity with puts getting gobbled up by the big boys, causing VIX to go up.  This basically means that the MMs are really uncertain about their positions and are hedging the heck out of all of it. JPM really could be the first domino to fall.|2020-07-13 13:16:44

As theta eats away at both and I'm left with simply the 10 points of delta?   The bid/ask spreads are big and volatile on both right now, but I'm hovering around a sale value of 6.00 or so - I'm not opposed to closing out, but should I reasonably expect the bid/ask spreads to tighten if it were to stay ITM as the week ticks on?

xy4g92|hqcqy1|hqcqy1|4|I am trying to learn technical so leaving comments as a way to test my performance.   &#x200B;  Right now I only have 2 positions:   2x SQ 8/7 130/125p put credit spread   1x AMZN 8/21 2940/2935p put credit spread  &#x200B;  Right now, RSI is showing that SQ is oversold now. I am suspecting that future movement in SQ will begin to trend upwards as investors/speculators gain a bit more confidence now that SQ has repeatedly tested the \~$127ish range. With earnings coming early August, I expect to see *some* wiggle room upwards with SQ. Would not recommend holding anything through earnings. I am personally doing put credit spreads, but call debit spreads or long calls could work.  AMZN had a really hype day and also lost a fair bit of today's gains. RSi is showing that AMZN is a bit overbought and falling towards a baseline. I am suspecting AMZN will have one or two flat-ish days in the near term, but will overall go upwards with earnings coming very soon. I also would not recommend holding any short term positions through earnings as earnings *could* already be priced in for AMZN. If anyone is looking to short put credit spreads or make bullish plays, I would wait until there is confirmation with a red or a flat day for AMZN, and get in then.   &#x200B;  I do not recommend being bearish on either until after earnings, but that is just me.  Best of luck to everyone!|2020-07-13 12:19:13
