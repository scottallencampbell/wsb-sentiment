7y5ljr|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|1|Please remember sub rules, people come here to avoid political debates. This is not left vs right, its calls and puts, bulls and bears.  Rule 5.    Political Bullshit    This isn't /r/politics, /r/the_donald, /r/political_humor, etc. If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.        Nobody cares about your political opinions. If it's not about taking advantage of the political to make money then leave that baggage at home. WSB is not the stage for your lazy political regurgitation nor will it be used as a propaganda mouthpiece by anybody.|2022-05-09 13:08:13

7x49fp|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|11|**Today in History**: May 9th, 1873 [Der Krach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_9): Vienna stock market crash heralds the Long Depression.  *The Panic of 1873 was a financial crisis that triggered an economic depression in Europe and North America that lasted from 1873 to 1877 or 1879 in France and in Britain. In Britain, the Panic started two decades of stagnation known as the "Long Depression" that weakened the country's economic leadership. In the United States, the Panic was known as the "Great Depression" until the events of 1929 and the early 1930s set a new standard.*|2022-05-09 08:54:55

There's indication of massive capitulation volume but still no signs of positive divergence. Not getting greedy here, taking profit and scaling out of half of the position, letting the CCS ride.

The R/R being short is really bad here. Transferring some profits over to the long term stock account and buying GOOGL + AAPL shares.

7x5dio|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|7|Quick review: Interest rates are low -> Inflation, asset values, demand are high  FED raises interest rates by half a percent  Inflation, asset values, demand goes down  https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart  "Fed Raises Interest Rates by Half a Percent in Aggressive Move to Fight Inflation. The central bank will also begin selling off $47.5 billion worth of its securities each month, starting in June. May 4, 2022, at 2:14 p.m."  My opinion: The FED was steadily increasing interest rates until they tanked them [1.58% 2/19/2020 -> 0.05% 3/30/2020] to save the economy from COVID. FED rates are currently at 0.83%. Supply chain is still facing massive delays  My position: SPY 370 8/19/22|2022-05-09 09:03:14

7xts20|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|9|"All right, sweetheart. Pay up." You try to avoid looking into her mouth as she speaks, but you fail. What teeth remain are gray and dying.  You stand up and lift a corner of your Purple mattress and find $40: one $10 bill, two $5 bills, and the rest in singles. She rolls her eyes as you triple-check the count on the $1 bills, then she takes the cash and leaves, without a goodbye. Once the door closes behind her, your nose is filled with the stench of what you'd just done. Not for the first time, you regret being unable to afford one of the climate controlled storage units that circulate air.  You absentmindedly walk over to the ironing board where the last of your clothes hang and pull on a stained t-shirt. It's still a bit damp. Because you can't afford the laundromat, you've been sneaking into the park at night and handwashing your clothes in a stream. Last night, a couple of kids who were smoking weed had stumbled upon you, and your head and heart had filled with their confused laughter as you ran away.  You look again at the only other thing in this storage unit, your mattress, and you can taste the toxic poison of regret in your mouth as you remember what got you into this position. Arrogance and calls--blind conviction that a fictional money printer was stronger than a global recession.  You lost everything, but out of pity, your now-ex-wife told the judge that you could see your kids on some weekends. But you haven't exercised the privilege once in months. Not since you moved into here. You couldn't survive the anguish if they found out--if they knew their father washes his clothes in a stream at night, when no one can see him.|2022-05-09 11:49:10

7y4031|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|10|The first time I made love with my wife, we were at a bed and breakfast in New Hampshire. We had just graduated from high school, and I convinced her parents to let us go on a road trip together from Virginia to Maine, where I had extended family. I drove us without sleep to New Hampshire the first day. When we checked into the bed and breakfast, I could tell the old couple who owned it weren't sure if they should let two "kids" take a room, but they did. We were so tired from the drive, we crashed.  The next morning was what you would expect from a bed and breakfast. We had a delightful breakfast brought to our room, which we ate while we laughed on a King-sized bed, which neither of us had ever seen before. Then, with the taste of pancake and bacon in our mouth, and the hunger of youth, we found each other. In ways we never had before. We were still such stupid kids, but I knew in that moment I would love her forever. And here we are, 17 years later, and I was right. I love her more than ever.  The puts I bought last Thursday when we were at SPY 430 feel way better than that.|2022-05-09 12:57:19

7xlaye|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|14|Don't throw rocks at me, but I think we're at the bottom lmao. The QQQ is down -25%, the NQ is down -26%. These numbers are usually the bottoms in the vast majority of dips/crashes. If you're expecting 40%+ that means you think this is a 2000/2008 styled crash. But In 2008 we had a global financial crisis where institutions and banks were being liquidated. Millions of people were going bankrupt and/or losing their homes. It was an economic collapse. Whereas today, unemployment is at all time lows, job demand is still at all time highs, the economy is perfectly fine despite our high inflation. In 2000, the QQQ PE ratios were at 200, earnings were weak, companies were skating on thin ice. Right now the PE ratio for the QQQ is less than 25, most, if not all of the carnage has been done already. It's barely above its historical average now.|2022-05-09 10:52:52

7ylzqe|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|10|Lots of people talk about coming issues in the housing market...so here are some comments from various homebuilders around the country for some color as to what they are seeing:  >* Dallas builder: ‚ÄúInterest lists are shrinking or buyers are truly pausing.‚Äù * Houston builder: ‚ÄúMany first-time buyers simply no longer qualify with the increase in interest rates, as their debt-to-income ratio gets out of whack.‚Äù * San Antonio builder: ‚ÄúTraffic has been cut in half since the hike in rates.‚Äù * Raleigh builder: ‚ÄúInvestor activity has slowed dramatically.‚Äù * Provo builder: ‚ÄúInvestors are evaluating the investment more critically than in the past.‚Äù * Washington DC builder: ‚ÄúTraffic half what it was in March. Worried about first time buyers. Many fewer REAL buyers than number of people collected on interest list last 6 months. Certainly more attempts [from buyers] to negotiate.‚Äù * Seattle builder: ‚ÄúPause by a large population of buyers. To achieve our desired [sales] pace, we had to make price adjustments. Rates starting to knock people out of qualification.‚Äù * Riverside San Bernardino builder: ‚ÄúCancellations are starting to creep up due to loan declines and job losses. Waiting lists are certainly smaller. Saw an immediate change in buyer behavior when rates climbed over 5%.‚Äù * Los Angeles builder: ‚ÄúBuyers who are stretching to purchase have become more cautious.‚Äù * SanDiego builder: ‚ÄúBuyers are definitely a bit more edgy.‚Äù * Denver builder: ‚ÄúSales are slowing due to higher prices and rates. Backlog of buyers have remained but we are seeing new prospects priced out with interest rates and anticipated payments. Conforming loans quoting over 6%.‚Äù * Boise builder: ‚ÄúRising interest rates may have pulled some buyers forward, and we expect to see a slowing of sales in the coming months as a result.‚Äù * Salt Lake City builder: ‚ÄúIn our lower priced segments, buyers are compromising and reducing options.‚Äù * Bend builder: ‚ÄúOur market has slowed and prices are starting to drop.‚Äù * Atlanta builder: ‚ÄúSeen a decrease in the number of potential buyers who are participating in best and final offers on homes/homesites.‚Äù * Knoxville builder: ‚ÄúDetached 2,000-3,000 square foot product still selling, just not with 3 buyers for every home like a few months ago.‚Äù * Allentown builder: ‚ÄúDouble hit of higher home prices and higher mortgage interest rates clearly has reduced the number of qualified buyers. Our waiting list is almost zero as of April 30th.‚Äù * Philadelphia builder: ‚ÄúBetween higher interest rates and higher sales prices, along with high gas prices and a volatile stock market, we‚Äôre seeing a pullback in our sales.‚Äù * Tampa builder: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a significant shift in buyer behavior in the last 30 days. Florida was on fire and pricing has really come to a high point, and people are not willing to pay the prices anymore.‚Äù * Indianapolis builder: ‚ÄúTraffic has significantly declined and people have paused on moving forward with purchases.‚Äù * Kansas City builder: ‚ÄúOur lower end product has paused or slowed dramatically.‚Äù * Columbus builder: ‚ÄúHigher rates are definitely tempering buyer enthusiasm and traffic.‚Äù * Baltimore builder: ‚ÄúBuyers aren't putting in as many options as they did last year.‚Äù * Reno builder: ‚ÄúCancellation rate last month more than doubled from 6% to 16%. We attribute this to buyers that did not lock interest rates early in purchase process. Also seeing many buyers put buying decision on hold.‚Äù * Fresno builder: ‚ÄúFinding an increase in cancellations due to the rate increase. The majority of cancellations are resulting from fear vs non-qualification.‚Äù * Cleveland builder: ‚ÄúOnce we reach home closings, about 5% of our current customers on the books will be forced to bust out as they originally qualified at a 3.25% rate and won't be able to stretch beyond this.‚Äù * Sacramento builder: ‚ÄúSeeing trouble qualifying for entry-level buyers as they are priced out by rates.‚Äù * San Jose builder: ‚ÄúQuality traffic has significantly decreased.‚Äù|2022-05-09 14:59:41

I bought puts of $28 strike price when it was in the 30s, and after that it proceeded to shoot up to 60 in a bear market and has held steady in the $45 range since.

7xrcuz|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|9|The fact that this sub is so bearish should be your first clue. We‚Äôre in the middle of global conflict, crazy to think the US would let the economy crumble. Inflation peaked in March. AMZN, GOOG, GME split in a month or two and you really think those don‚Äôt pop? Chasdaq and hot tech summer is coming back. Biggest market makers are short the fucking world 100 times over what‚Äôs actually available. This is 2020 (part 2)   Why bet on the end of the world? It only happens once|2022-05-09 11:33:03
7ybsw0|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|9|Ok, hear me out.   This economy and asset market has shown that it can only perform under constant mollycoddling from the Fed, with ultra low interest rates and credit markets + treasuries being heavily propped up. It started to show these signs in first tantrum in 2013 and should have been 100% obvious when it threw the second tantrum in 2018.  It‚Äôs a sad reality that the largest asset market in the most powerful economy completely shits down its leg at the very thought of handling 2% interest rates.   With that said, while ‚Äúofficially‚Äù the Fed dual mandate is price control and employment, the unwritten and unsaid mandate is asset price protection. Has been since Bernanke. Probably always will be. We also have demographics to consider. Lots and lots of millenials finally got on the asset ladder, with passive investing, retirement account passive flows and piling pell mell, at great cost, into the housing market.   There is simply not going to be an appetite to break the backs of this country‚Äôs most important and productive generation at this point in time.   I believe we‚Äôre done with rate hikes. The asset purchases will start again. The Fed has ample excuse to start injecting heroin back into the addict‚Äôs veins when it sees headline inflation having slowed this month. And back we‚Äôll go, into this dystopian, fake ass propped up economy and fake ass asset pumping environment.   TL DR - Rest easy, folks. Jpow is going to fire that üí¥ üñ® back up any moment now. Hang in there.|2022-05-09 13:50:32
7y2rwa|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|12|ATTENTION RETARDED PEOPLE--DO NOT SELL...this algo-driven, forced liquidation bullshit is all a scam to steal all of our hard earned money. If you're not on margin, just look away from the screen or don't sign in to your brokerage account for the time being. Perhaps you might considering averaging down too or just holding on to cash. AT MOST Fed will do just a few more hikes this year and, with respect to unwinding the balance sheet, it will take place at a SNAIL'S PACE. NO WAY all of this selling was warranted, especially w/this being 1st summer USA economy will be fully opened. This is financial advice and you should take it!|2022-05-09 12:49:05

The only other option is if they stimulate their way out of a recession and blow up the deficit more.  They will have to keep inflation high to try to inflate our debt away.  High inflation will stick around for years, possibly decades, and it will do nothing except ruin everyone's savings, slow GDP, and make the USD lose its reserve status.

How shocking was it when everything pumped 1-2% on a daily basis the last 2 years for absolutely no reason? 0 changed about company's fundamentals. Most new "investors" today don't understand what a stock represents. You're buying a piece of a company and becoming part owner in exchange for a portion of the dividends from earnings. Fundamentals matter and buying something because it's "the new hot thing" or because "everyone I know is buying a Tesla/Iphone" literally means nothing. Learn how to actually read a balance sheet and income statement, not to mention fundamental ways of valuing a company such as price/sales ratios or PEG ratios. You will not make it buying on "memes." Like any trade investing takes a lot of time and learning, and I will thoroughly enjoy the max exodus of Youtube and Twitter "investors" when this crash is finished|2022-05-09 09:07:47

My entire investment experience is using an Acorns account I have been putting $200 USD/month into for the last 15 months or so.

Or because it‚Äôs a small dollar amount and sticking with it isn‚Äôt that much a make or break do I withdrawn the balance and wait for the market to rebound.   Or do I withdraw completely and go with a different investment strategy.   Thanks for reading.|2022-05-09 13:47:37

7witth|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|0|Those waiting for a housing crash are going to be sorely disappointed.  Housing is not stocks. Prices have gone way up simply because there is massive demand and not enough supply. Sure, rising interest rates will cool off the housing market, but it won't crash.  Home may appreciate at 2-3% instead of 10+%.  You know what happens if rates rise? Rich people who wanted to buy $800k-1.5M homes now gobble up $500-750k homes.  People who wanted to sell will now not put homes on the market because they will have mortgage rates higher than what they currently have and/or they won't be able to buy one to move into.  It'll just end up reducing the the supply as well, maintaining higher prices.  The more you wait for a crash, the more you'll be priced out and miss on gains. It is a fundamental supply vs demand problem. Banks also only lend to very strong borrowers these days, so people will be waiting for a crash for a long time. Cashing out stocks and buying a home was one of the best moves I've ever made. Some of you have your entire wealth tied to gme stock and it shows. Diversify your wealth into hard assets like a home smooth brains. It will do much better in this inflationary and stagflationary environment.  Lol, nothing better than having a real interest rate that is negative and almost getting paid by the bank to own a stupid house.|2022-05-09 05:25:21

7x8yjn|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|1|So much negative sentiment, apocalyptic views, I thought SPY is gonna drop like 5%. And you were all saying like 20%. So yea, sentiment is negative, trend is bearish, but seems to me we touched the bottom at 402. Give or take 1-2$.    I will wait wensday. Since all is priced in, with this kind of negative sentiment, even slightly lower inflation will mean, just slightly good news, will make spy skyrocket. Its holding pretty good so far.   I will buy some puts, but I dont think we are gonna see 395$ levels. Especially if I buy puts, then it will skyrocket no matter what. Yesterday I said its gonna be sideways. If today ends above 406$ i will bet it will stay above 406$ near term|2022-05-09 09:28:58

7xdsh8|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|-4|So, correct me if Im worng. Most of you listen to media, owned by big companies/investors, who clearly have interest in spreading panic among retail investors and other investors. If they think SPY will bottom at 370$, they will sell panic that SPY bottom is 350$.   Are you gonna bear fruit of market crash? Not really? Are they shorting whole market, making everybody sell. What happens when they cover? What happens when it hits bottom, but its higher than they said? When they start covering and buying this dip, we will fall to another market manipulation - FOMO. We will be fucked. Not them. Stop spreading panic unnecessary. Enjoy win on puts and dont buy short dated calls. Easy.

7ya7k3|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|-4|Glad I double checked the news on AMC.  Bought back in on calls.  just a little as a hedge. and I'm broke.  AMC has been beat down from where it was holding around 14-16 to around 12.70 at time of posting.  AMC has the capability of tanking super hard or mooning back to 14.50 'ish'.    Yahoo is showing the following    Support 4.07- (Yikes!)    Resistance 14.67  - (Not great, but room to move up)    Stop loss  8.57  - (eww)     If they report positive earnings, they 'moon' to 15 or 16.  Maybe get crazy on some FOMO to 30+  Negative earnings below -86 and next stop is 5.00  So super cheap bets to play.  Negative earnings between 0 and -.86 cents and it's a collective 'meh'.  But maybe a swing back to 14 anyway cause summer is coming.|2022-05-09 13:39:46

At face value, if it ends up happening, should in theory be a big boost to consumer spending in the same sense that the stimmy checks were. Only it lasts longer.

7yauf0|ulnqvr|ulnqvr|-2|I'm fairly new to picking stocks.   I'm trying to understand the valuation of $HMC. I wondered if a few in the community could help me out. It seems insanely underpriced right now, but I wondered if I'm missing something.   Here's why:   Honda has a really great product and a loyal customer base.   Has $85billion in shareholder equity, but is only valued at $44 billion.   Has solid earnings history.   I'm trying to figure out why it is priced so low. My best guesses are that investors are punishing Honda for not investing heavily in electric and concerns about supply chain issues. It also may be down because of its sporadic recent dividend history. But even factoring those into the equation, this stock seems way underpriced.   Like I said, I'm new to trading so I'd be interested in feedback from more experienced traders. (I am currently long $HMC and considering expanding my position)|2022-05-09 13:44:03
