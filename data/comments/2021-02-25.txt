op6y0z|ls42x6|ls42x6|300|IMPORTANT INFO FOR NOOBS:   HALTS- they happen every day on plenty of stocks that have high volatility and price spikes. It’s normal so don’t let it scare you. Halts usually last for 5 min sometimes longer so keep an eye on what happens next. Selling because of halts can screw you out of massive gains.   ROBINHOOD- doesn’t choose when to halt trading. The SEC/NASDAQ does that. RH can restrict trading like they did in January but they CANNOT halt trading.   DIPS- don’t freak tf out if GME dips $20 pre market. That is not significant. Especially when we opened yesterday at $44. So calm down plz.   Hope this helps you make smarter decisions on our way to the moon. Cheers and have fun 🥂|2021-02-25 06:48:15

There's ups and downs, but as long as you can persist in your vision, you WILL always find a way through this. Give up, then you will never ever get what you want, easy as that.   If you took a beating today, calm the fuck down. The worst thing you can do is lose composure and do some stupid fuck shit and make things worst. Grab a bite, smoke a bowl, go lift... whatever it is you enjoy. It's a new day tomorrow, and there's ALWAYS better things to come. Whoever the fuck you are, I have faith in you that you will get out of this. Have faith in yourself!|2021-02-25 18:36:36

opkbth|ls42x6|ls42x6|6|Interesting datapoint...   I have short selling access on my platform. To see if GME had shares available to borrow, I put in an order to short 20 shares @ market ($137).  The order was conditionally accepted with a short sell borrow rate of 1%, which is very low interest cost. I didn't execute it but thought it was interesting that shares were available to borrow at this price and borrow rate. May indicate less of a short squeeze environment.

Before this turns into (more of) a cult like last time, keep in mind HOLDING doesn't mean jack shit in this context. This is most likely a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze (yet?)  Momentum needs to sustained through buying (option calls are better than shares), though the odds are against you with MMs jacking up premiums much faster than last time and those holding multibaggers ITM selling off. Plus, never forget this is a battle between whales, don't be a hero and baghold, so cut it out with the apes together shit.  Ah yes, I had the lasagna.|2021-02-25 08:10:48

opwmll|ls42x6|ls42x6|6|OSK (Oshkosh Truck Corp who won the contract to replace the USPS fleet) shot up to over $126 a share after the news broke, but has settled down at $110. Looking them over, I expect the stock to jump back up at least 10% over the next week. Not a mega tendies play like GME, but I think it's a safe bet. Stonk should be in the $118-120 range AT LEAST right now.      Most EV companies are largely speculative at this point. OSK actually is making vehicles for multiple clients, plus now has a HUGE customer with an order for as many as 15k trucks a year for 10 years, that OSK will design, build, and maintain. I honestly am surprised the stock didn't jump 40% or more.|2021-02-25 10:15:33

oqlr5l|ls42x6|ls42x6|6|Hello Fellow Retards!  If you want to know what is causing this GME stock price soar and why you should be getting in you are in the right place.  **‘Gamma squeeze’** :  The options buying can, under certain circumstances, create conditions in which a price rally feeds on itself. Known as a “gamma squeeze,” this occurs when the sellers of the call options, in order to hedge their positions, buy the underlying stock. As the price of the stock rises, they need to buy more to maintain their hedge, creating the feedback loop.

To add fuel to fire, the 10Y U.S Treasury note is mooning, take a look yourself:   [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx)  &#x200B;  Now we love our stocks, but these treasury notes move a few points a year, this thing is movement all that much each day, this is beyond insane.   &#x200B;  10Y U.S Note goes up, big institutions sell billions to get into 10Y note, they make a return at a much, much, MUCH lower risk.   Each day this thing soars, the market fears in going down.   &#x200B;  Anyways, at this point, my GME positions are serving as an unlikely hedge to this market.|2021-02-25 10:51:08

op7zi6|ls42x6|ls42x6|13|Greetings Retards. I'm not a kid and been waiting for a moonshot squeeze for a long time. I'm in with 75 shares my cost about 200 per share.  I played the AMC thing in the usual way and made enough on that to stay diamond on GME. This is not about making 10 20 30 or 100 thousand. This is about the moonshot. I'm not budging until we get into multiple thousands as a per share price. Even then I will always hold most of the shares I own as a badge of honor.  Today and Friday are big moments in time - It's not over yet either - this is a major battle but the war will continue after that. Anyone on the sidelines now can still get on this train to history.  Anyone who holds or buys now is a hero.   Wall street big boys are on the ropes - Are you going to be Rocky Balboa or Jerry Quarry?  All you whipper snappers can Google that and figure that out and this is not advice in any way because I am an ugly fat old ape|2021-02-25 06:59:27

opm1uw|ls42x6|ls42x6|5|Not financial advice: I am a dumb ape  Everyone should hold, but understand that the Hedges are going to seek revenge after yesterday. Remember, they are still wounded from the last rocket blast. Hedges lost $70B. The stock is going to drop today. By a lot. Shorts NEED to do everything they can to survive. An hour before closing, I think our whale friend is going to do a somersault splash and rain down tendies on all of us.   Tomorrow, Call options need to be bought. So that is going to drive the price tomorrow. Buy the dips, buy it at low prices. If it goes to $40 again, BUY BUY BUY.   If the price decides to go back up, I find it does so after 10am. Closer to 10:45-10:50am. I was ready to buy another stock with the limited peasant money I have for $155 USD. I live in Canada so that's almost $200 here. It's a lot. But its dead grandmother ape money (bless you nanna) and hopefully I can make myself richer.   If the price tag is too high: AMC. Why? When cinemas are open, that is a $30 stock. So tripling your money ain't so bad at $10/share.      TL;DR - DO NOT SELL. BUY THE DIPS|2021-02-25 08:59:09

There is a game being played here by fish much bigger than the apes, who are just stupidly along for the ride. But this is not normal.|2021-02-25 10:06:28

A bunch of you were buzzing about GME in my community and I was trying to tamp it down out of respect for my crew and our mission.  The media likes to lump us all together to smack us with the same hammer.  Anyway, just wanted to wish you all the best today.  Every one of you that stuck together against all this is amazing and I hope you all get your tendies.  Just know that there are many of us out there rooting you on.  I've held a small bag of GME since $70 just to show support because it's fucked up what they did to you all.  And I know of others doing the same thing.  Good luck today.  God Speed.

I'm guessing if the people who bought in too high last time get out and break even, and many decide to take profit BuT There is more reinvestment once it all levels off again or falls hard , would this all happen again?( If the HFs decide to not change strategy?)  My hope is people do what's best for them but also reinvest if it comes back low. I plan to hold mostly, why? Because this kind of retarded perfect storm is rare.

op22p4|ls42x6|ls42x6|13|Nah won’t happen. Last time they managed to drag it down was because RH (and some other brokers) restricted/shut down GME from being bought.  480 - GME shuts down on x brokers. No opportunity to buy, driving the price down.   300-250 - GME is being restricted and people can only have 2-5 shares. Driving the price even further down.   250 - 150 - domino effect takes place, most paper hands are evacuating, GME is being halted 10 times a day driving it further and further down once it opens for 5 min before being halted again.   150-50 - GME at low volume, GME being halted if it goes up 10$. And shorts are just driving the price down and keeping it there for the rest of the day. Momentum drops to zero.   50-60 - GME is gaining volume last 2 days, giving it the first 2 Green Day’s in weeks.   60-91.70 - GME picks up momentum and whales are coming in. Momentum is back, driving the price up to 91.70 before trading is halted for the last 15 min of the day.   To be continued....|2021-02-25 05:49:48

I genuinely felt bad for those who got misled thinking it was going to hit 1k + and then bought 400 dollar shares and diamond handed into nothing.   I feel differently now. Round 2 of GME I am hoping for a burning wreck of a collapse and that all the “investors” lose everything and never trade again.   If you feel compelled to downvote me, you’re in the wrong thread.

The Nasdaq will more than likely slide again tomorrow, probably not to the extent we have seen the last few days/weeks, maybe another .5%.  This obviously will be caused mostly by the continuing sell off of big tech stocks such as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft as the big money rotated towards other sectors.  But this should hopefully be the end of the selling. I can’t really see this continuing into next week. I’m not predicting huge gains next week but with the rotation complete, prices will pick back up again and we’ll see a return to a bull market.

Hedge funds just buying up the dips on all the industrials and banks and energy and when retail realizes, it'll be too late, they'll fomo in and then institutions sell off their cyclicals and buy back into tech.

oq7ud7|ls42x6|ls42x6|5|Its easy to buy while the price is high, but it takes real conviction to buy low. If you dont take risks, you'll just be where you are now...you need to take risks to make change, its simple but true  Or you can wait and FOMO in when you see it do another massive run, up to you 🤦‍♂️  I suggest you buy shares. Options are not worth it right now unless you gamble with FDs. Check optionsprofitcalculator.com, you barely make anything more than just holding shares.  Good luck boys, see you on the moon.🚀🚀🚀🥵🥵🥵  Check the CNBC post, they lost 16 billion, and they are going to lose it again...short squeeze again lmao. They dont learn. Let's keep taking them to school.  Full Credit to u/HeyItsPixeL one of the best DDs I’ve ever read   (9:51AM): THEY ARE SHORTING $GME VIA 63(!) DIFFERENT ETFS**    (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY! (https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme; https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)    Also: They borrowed 1,500,000 $GME Shares to short yesterday (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs.    TL;DR: Millions of shares being sold short today, trying to get people to panic sell. DATA IS FROM 9:45AM.

Step 3 if you need money for bills tell your wife to put on lace and make an only fans with her boyfriend. Step 4 share wife’s only fans of her and her boyfriend in a newly created wives of WSB subreddit to leverage Reddit’s two primary directives aka stonks and nudes. Step 5 charge all the apes retards and paper hands and hedgies 5 bucks a month for the only fans content and you just made 5 million bucks because  the hedgies love to both fuck you over and love to watch your wife fuck her boyfriend while fucking you over by shorting stonks to nothing.

oqglcs|ls42x6|ls42x6|5|Reposting because automod blocked me for using a no no word.  &#x200B;  Guys, I have a theory. It's half baked and based on nothing so you know, grain of salt. My theory is that, while GME was unique, it was not an anomaly. I think these hedge funds have been so used to unrestricted market shenanigans that they probably went overboard shorting on a bunch of stocks. It probably worked for a long time too while individual retail investors got fucked by the manipulation. Suddenly, retail wised up and realized that alone they are a single stick but together they make a mighty fajjit. Now this has shaken the institutions to the core as they are no longer the monopoly on market manipulation. Suddenly they have competition and they don't like it and are spooked. That's causing the drop in the market overall. They are scared that they can't do whatever they want, whenever they want, with nobody calling their BS. Suddenly they might actually have to stop being in the batting cage and go up against an opposing pitcher and they are wetting themselves over it.|2021-02-25 12:29:53

I have my GME stock that i bought at 300$. Ive Held onto it with my dimond hands. However, i come to you today with a startling new discovery. I have recently watched the preserverance landing on mars and though "how incredibly lonely it must be to have an entire planet to yourself, but noone to experience it with." i then looked to see when the best time to launch to mars is so if, hypothetically speaking, i were to want to join that jolly robot on the red planet, i could. I discovered that FRIDAY THE 26TH IS WITHIN THE LAUNCH WINDOW TO HAVE THE MOST EFFICIENT TRAVEL TO THE RED PLANET!!! This was a sigh for me, and hopefully you my brothers! Lets join Preserverance on Mars (figurativly) and take GME not to the moon..... BUT TO MARS!!! Let us see this liftoff of our beloved stock and see the sweet, sweet tendies shower upon us! Let us surpass the moon, and land on MARS!|2021-02-25 08:45:35

op0mvo|ls42x6|ls42x6|20|Ive been a pro trader since 1997.  GME fell to about 121 this morning.  I think that is a floor to watch. 138 seems to be a comfortable place for it to keep ending up.  I buy in thousand share blocks and already pulled 10 points.  Personally, I think it may fall below 130 but then I think it will take off again.  Expect halts as we saw yesterday.  That is the only thing that scares me with this stock. SEC screwing around trying to keep the regular man down.  Remember, the elites dont want us to have any power.  Power = Money.|2021-02-25 05:29:41
op1fse|ls42x6|ls42x6|13|Hello fellow apes... paper hand here :(     I lost about 50% with GME in the first run, arriving late at the party and buying around 400$ for then selling around 260$ (various trades, and they get summed up to about 50% loss).  I want to YOLO in... I almost need to YOLO in... if that goes the right way.  I would be ok with just recovering the losses, so I have to admit, I would consider selling once +100% again has been made.  Worst thing of them all? I bought GME yesterday for the first time again at around 50$ and then sold at 48$ not seeing any interesting movement on top of what it had done yet.  Fast forward: plus fucking 150% in one night.  Please support my crying... I need a comforting word right now.  &#x200B;  PS: I would really like to YOLO that in all over again... Would you guys wait for the usual 10.30am drop or fuck hell YOLO all in at market price at the opening bell?  I LIKE THE STOCK.|2021-02-25 05:41:08

opwwio|ls42x6|ls42x6|8|A group of traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets (WSB) forum are targeting GameStop again, making new plans for “gamma compression” on the stock.  The move comes amid another rally in GameStop shares, which have risen more than 150% this week alone.  A user by the name of “KitrosReddit” explained in a post the potential of a “Mother of All Little Pushes” on Thursday, garnering over 25,000 upvotes on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum.  In the post, the WSB member argues that it wasn't a classic short squeeze that pushed GameStop stock prices up in the first Reddit-led push, but rather something called a "squeeze." gamma".  &#x200B;  And while posts on Reddit aren't always backed up by empirical evidence, the user has made his points.  &#x200B;  Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of Interactive Brokers and chief trader of its Timber Hill business unit, spoke with Vicky Ge Huang of Insider and explained the effects gamma pressures can have on stocks.  According to Sosnick, when traders on Reddit started using call options to profit from their bets on GameStop, they created the conditions for gamma compression.  And as GameStop's short interest has fallen to about 38% of the float, according to data from S3 partners, gamma compression appears to be the only way Reddit traders can bring about another monumental leap in GameStop stocks.  Traders on the WSB forum also referred to an AI model used to predict GameStop stock prices. A trader on Reddit created the AI ​​model and was surprised to see that it showed GameStop to hit $ 130,000 per share.  &#x200B;  According to "KitrosReddit", it is a possibility if GME hits $ 800 per share on Friday, as that price would trigger the "Mother of All Gamma Squeezes" as call option sellers would be forced to buy shares to guarantee delta coverage.  The scenario is unlikely. The stock is expected to rally around 550% the next day or two to lay the groundwork, and even then, GameStop at $ 130,000 is a lofty goal even in a “mother of all pressures” situation.  And as the market saw in January with the last run on GameStop stock, brokerage houses and clearing houses could struggle to support such massive trading volume, and it is possible that applications from Popular trading like Robinhood again restrict certain names.  Regardless of which plans are best laid out, what is clear is that Reddit is once again driving historic traffic to GameStop call and stock options, with markets bracing for more drama around a group. Even stock that dominated headlines in January.|2021-02-25 10:17:31

oqq732|ls42x6|ls42x6|7|GME is gonna close around 145 to 155, with maybe a top marker around the opening price, at least that is my prediction. I've been right plenty of times, been wrong plenty as well so \*shrug\*  What happens tomorrow is still a coin flip. Be wary friends. Personally, if I was still in GME I'd have sold once it spiked above the opening price (so 170+) after buying the morning dip and see what tomorrow brings. If you're still in the game, there will always be that dip.  It's a spooky stock to hold overnight. Personally, I bought at around 55 yesterday and sold just shy of the AH peak. Contemplated buying the morning dip this morning but was too much of a coin flip for me, I like to roll loaded dice as often as I can. Turns out I did miss out on that bet, but I didn't feel like being glued to a screen all day either.  &#x200B;  Good luck folks. If you're holding, please don't be left with the bag - have an exit strategy! **I'd rather yall get the tendies than the HFs.**  &#x200B;  EDIT: It closed at 109. A potential chance for a second rally tomorrow, if you don't break through 200 please get off the boat before close.|2021-02-25 13:28:43

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

opxce2|ls42x6|ls42x6|9|Okay retards im going to explain what a short is and what is happening right now because im sure many people don’t understand why these stocks are rising so much. in laymans terms big hedge funds have placed “bets” that these stocks will do poorly and their price will drop. However if the stock doesnt plummet then the shorts are forced to buy in order to save money which in turn drives up the price of these stocks, which is called a squeeze. So in short dont sell, because if the shares don’t drop the hedgies will be forced to buy the stocks which will drive up the price. Also for legal purposes i must state that i am both retared and an ape.|2021-02-25 10:20:40

ophzx8|ls42x6|ls42x6|2|Question about options:  Say there are some 2K+ call contracts at $200 strike expiring ~~today~~ tomorrow. I understand that if they are ITM the holders can sell that contract for a profit.  HOWEVER, doesn't that still mean that at the end of the day the last person holding them has to exercise those contracts to profit, since they can't resell them? Which means someone has to deliver those shares, but also that those shares will be SOLD at time of exec?  Just trying to understand what all the ITM contracts will mean for the share price, since there are some heavy interest at 200, 250, 300, 400  PS: I think the OTM contracts are just worthless at time of expiration, right?|2021-02-25 08:29:28

opipdb|ls42x6|ls42x6|2|   Good Morning Fuckers  With the Robinhood IPO coming soon, it's very likely that Vlad will not do anything to risk the performance of the stock on its first couple of days. That being said, in the hearings, he also said that restricting the buying of the securities was a mistake and that restricting the number of shares you could buy was a better alternative. Here is my proposition, if they do limit the number of shares you can buy, I say we all make Robinhood accounts with a shitload of burner emails, your wife's phone, her boyfriend's phone, and every device within a 100-meter radius. This is the only path to the moon people.|2021-02-25 08:35:10

oqay1p|ls42x6|ls42x6|2|I am convinced any price action you see today is a result of increased margin requirements and closing out positions of the whales that used bank/fed money.    If the stock you are monitoring went up today, congrats!  It just means there were more short positions than long opened on margin.  If your stock went down today, at least you can rest easy knowing that big money was over-leveraged on the long side and may increase their positions again once volatility settles and margin requirements relax.|2021-02-25 11:55:28

or3rcj|ls42x6|ls42x6|2|Let me give you retards some hope for SPY atleast;  Last week of January (during the GME saga), spy dropped around -2.5%. Over this past week, SPY has also dropped -2.5% (majority of it today which is also true for in January as the drop occurred over Thursday and Friday.   SPY proceeded to bounce almost 5% in the next week, hitting ATH.   So, if you do some basic math, then you can estimate that if SPY goes up 5% next week (with renewed stimulus and vaccine hope) then we can hit $400-402.

So WSB saves dumpster baby and watches it grow. Dumpster baby turns into a successful brokerage and wants to thank WSB for its success.  So a new brokerage is formed -- one with an opt-in chat feature. Maybe it's got a little sombrero as a logo because that's what's in right now. Maybe it partners with Reddit, who knows (it's "my" retarded story, okay?). If you opt in to the chat, all position and transactions in your account are view-only for other users you interact with.  Would you opt in? .. or is "position or ban" the way? .. or is this Wendys again?   DISCLAIMER: This isn't real, nor is it market research (I work in health care). I just got to thinking after some time on this forum and after having signed up with a trading app recently that has its own built-in chat system.

opbgqm|ls42x6|ls42x6|5|New article on Robinhood:  >**Exchange and SEC-Imposed Trading Halts on Individual Stocks**  > **Trading halts on specific symbols**  > Trading halts for specific symbols may be implemented for a variety of reasons and can interrupt your orders to buy or sell particular securities. These stock-based halts are initiated by the specific stock exchange where the stock is listed or by the Securities and Exchange Commission, not by Robinhood. >  > During a trading halt, one or more securities exchanges will prevent all trades of the affected security. These halts typically last less than an hour but may be longer. Halts can range from occurring multiple times in a single trading day to remain in place over multiple trading days. If a security is in a trading pause in the last 10 minutes of normal trading hours, the primary listing exchange will not reopen trading on that security until the next trading day. You can keep track of current and historical trading halts across both the NYSE and the Nasdaq websites. >  > Keep in mind, market-wide trading halts can also be implemented by exchanges during periods of heightened volatility across the broader market. >  > **Who imposes these halts?**  > Trading halts are usually put in place by one or more of the stock exchanges or the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). A trading halt for a specific security could be due to a number of reasons, like waiting for substantial news to be released or periods of high volatility. You can find a more detailed list of trading halts reasons here. >  > **What do I need to do?**  > When a halt is in place, you can place orders as usual, but they won’t be processed until after the halt has been removed from the affected security. >  > **What happens to my new or existing orders during a trading halt?**  > You can place new orders during a trading halt, but new or existing orders will not be processed until the market reopens or the trading halt is removed. This applies to market-wide halts and halts on specific securities. If you enter a “Good Til Cancelled” order and the market closes while a halt is in effect, your order will be held for execution at the opening of the next trading day. Additionally, orders entered as “Good for the Day” will be cancelled at the end of the trading day regardless of whether a trading halt is in effect. >  > All new and outstanding orders will remain “pending” until markets reopen, or the trading halt is removed. When the halt ends, your orders will be processed. This also applies to options orders. >  > **Why are my orders not filling after a halt is lifted?**  > There are a few reasons why your stock orders might not have been filled after a halt is lifted. The most common are listed below, however you should check the details of your specific order. >  > **Collared market buys**  > If you submitted a market order to buy during a halt and the price increases by more than 5%, your order won’t execute due to the 5% collar on the order. If the price falls back within the 5% collar of the original order price, your order will execute if the market is still open. If your buying power is within 5% of the total cost of your market order, you may not be able to place a market order. Limit orders do not have the 5% collar. Market sell orders during trading hours are not collared.  Expect some Vlad-sponsored bullshit today.|2021-02-25 07:33:36

But this time , it will be bigger than the last money making ticker I showered you guys with which is CLSN. Here is a new ticker that I want you guys to cash in on soon.   Company: Corvus Pharmaceuticals   Analysis  1) Insider bought millions of shares about 1 week ago for 3.5$ a share which presents as support.  2) Hedge funds also bought around 3.5-4$ a share which indicates a strong move to the upside soon. We all know these funds love to triple their money so get in early with them.  3) the float of this stock is still low.  4) Price is still under 4$ which presents a buying opportunity couple with low risk.  5) My PT for this company is 20$ but multiple analysts reported high 15$ , median 9$, low 4$.  6) The management team used to own Pharmacyclic which sold for 261$ dollar a share. The management has experience to turn a profit for investors.  7) The company has a long pipeline in works, we should expect news very soon.   Conclusion  Get in early while it’s still cheap because it will absolutely rocket 100-200% when they release news which I think should be very soon. PT 20$|2021-02-25 13:27:31

oqsk0g|ls42x6|ls42x6|2|plays on UVXY —  why you probably shouldn’t buy calls. im playing short term puts between 8-8.5 on UVXY for 2/26. heres why.. when the short term vix contracts fall, you move closer and closer to ITM. when they rise, you clearly move further and further OTM but you get the tack on your premium for....volatility, duh   so, if youre holding calls and getting zonked, this observation is actually working inversely on the bull side of the spread. so you feel like you can never get ahead. also, this drops so much faster than it rises.   example using 2/26 - $8 puts for UVXY  (bid-ask in pennies)  - 2-3 buy @.02 - 1-2 buy @.01 - 1-3 hold (vix rising)  - 2-3 sell @.03 from volatility spike   🍻    -this is NOT investment advice. please consult with a professional|2021-02-25 13:44:38

ophr41|ls42x6|ls42x6|5|Not trying to throw shade at GME but AMC is the much better play here. They have a higher float and are criminally undervalued already.

IT MAKES YOU THE BAD KIND OF RETARDED.  &#x200B;  This makes it sound as though those investing in the meme stocks are causing the broader market correction by forcing these rollouts.  This is not only patently false, but the opposite of the problem.  &#x200B;  The problem is hedge funds that keep excessively shorting the meme stocks to try and prove a point and to exert dominance over retail traders in spite of being shown time and again they can't do it, and thus having to roll out of their other positions to cover  their losses.  It's like playing an RTS and having some dude keep throwing 500 of his troops at some tower you've got because he's just determined to take it down, even if it means the destruction of the rest of his map.  &#x200B;  They're like Ahab and that god damned whale.

oq4lge|ls42x6|ls42x6|3|Notice how SPY is down now while GME is doing so well. They claim it's because of bond yields rising yet it gapped up over $11 despite knowing very well that the yields are going to rise. Gross. I wonder if they're doing this in order to gradually take profits from their positions in order to prevent any alarms from going off too early, continuing the illusion of everything being alright. I posted this on the GME thread but I think more exposure the better.  If the trend follows the same pattern as the 23rd at around 9:45AM, look for a trend reversal on large buy volume.|2021-02-25 11:11:44

oqwco4|ls42x6|ls42x6|2|People you can either be an independent thinker and win in the market or join the herd and lose money like sheeple. SPY is going to tank. This could be the start. Highest volume in a month, right at the heavy 3900 resistance and island cluster reversal signal (also a double top just hit yesterday). SPY could go under 200 over the next few months and I genuinely think it will happen. Think that sounds ridiculous? You're jaded by the last 10 years of running with the bulls. Guess where SPY **peaked** at in 2007 before the housing crisis liquidated the markets? $154. Guess where the **bottom** of SPY was in 2009 after the bubble burst. $68. Still think $200 sounds ridiculous? Because it's higher than the peak of a bubble 14 years ago and 3X higher then the low 12 years ago. You think these little dips we've seen the last week were bad? Those are gonna look like an absolute joke compared to the selling that's coming.|2021-02-25 14:10:27

oppfun|ls42x6|ls42x6|1|NEED SOME INFO-   I’ve been trading for a few years and never used margin, until recently. I was wayyyyyyy up on my Ehang and sold when Wolfpack did their shitty short report, then rebought everything I could when it hit bottom using all the margin I could. (Yup I really have faith in EH)  It is the majority of my portfolio and took a dip after going way up following the short report. I was in a deficit and then a margin call which was covered yesterday at market close.  However today, even though my portfolio is worth more, they are saying I have a 6K deficit. Do they just change this on a whim? Why do I owe them basically ALL the margin I took when my shit is doing better today than yesterday?|2021-02-25 09:23:54

Like 60c or 80c when we were at 50 after the first rise in January. I know, premium Yada Yada, but if they know or fear to be on the loosing side they could at least mitigate a little. I also know that this scenario would leave some hf with huge bags, while others might get away with some bruises. Would these hf show any solidarity with their competitors? Or are they still convinced that retail apes will give up anytime soon?|2021-02-25 11:15:03
oq53fk|ls42x6|ls42x6|1|A STUDY IN CANNABIS OPPORTUNITIES:   PART1 **HYFM:** Largest institutional shareholder is Terra Tech, **TRTC** 🚀🚀🚀**TRTC**: Was the first cannabis company to go public back in 2012, they went on a tear until the Canadian market launched a ton of competitors. Currently they have a $50 MKT CAP with COVID behind them they should be able to get back to at least a $20M revenue run rate. Major shareholders have lockups at .30 cents. Most interesting though is the company invested into HydroFarm (**HYFM**) Nasdaq for $5 million a couple years ago. HYFM just went public last December currently trading over $80 a share. Terra Tech **TRTC** has 600,00 shares and 300,00 warrants with a $16.85 strike price. Combined that's close to $70 Million in value. AGAIN the company has a $50 Million market cap and owns Approx $70 Million of **HYFM** stock not to mention their retail and cultivation assets in CA and NV. IMHO it's only a matter of time before the market realizes the arbitrage. **HYFM** is run by Bill Toler who turned around Hostess the guys track record is of Wall St. Legends.  In addition there is a high probability that the feds will work to pass laws favorable to cannabis this year.  Good trading you TARDS!!!!  DIAMONDS ARE MY HANDS 💎🙌 .....  PART 2: Kushco **KSHB** coming soon.  Not financial Advice im long TRTC and HYFM|2021-02-25 11:15:11

It says I’m buying $12 per share. That mean I need to have 1200 available to buy the shares? So the initial $87 which is maximum loss is basically paying to play to possibly buy 100 shares at 12 a piece? Is this right? I’m trying to make my first call and am a bit retarded.

oqoh9w|ls42x6|ls42x6|1|IF YOUR BUYING OR SELLING: PLEASE BUY/SELL in FRACTIONAL SHARES  EXPLANATION:  This will cause more demand since we will create A LOT OF FRACTIONAL SHARES that Short sellers cannot purchase. EVERY 100 fractional shares makes it harder for one short contract to sell.  Textbook example:  If we buy fractional shares. Short sellers can’t buy those shares so let’s say we have a 1000 shares. And 150.2 are owned by 6 Redditors, they as an ARMY own 901.2 shares. Short sellers only have access to 98.8 shares that means they can’t close the short contract aka they will pay a lot of money for those last two shares. AKA BUY FRACTIONAL IT CAUSES MORE DEMAND!!!|2021-02-25 13:17:30

SNDL is cheap to throw some ducats at, APHA costs least than TLRY and stand to gain value on stock if merged. Uncomfortable with that, THCX has a lot of these players in their ETF.

opa61p|ls42x6|ls42x6|1|Last question: So say for example, I have a call option, 20¢ premium, $10 strike price. I buy 1 contract at 20¢ premium. I spend $20 on premium, and the strike price is $10 still. Say a couple days before the contract expires the price hits $15. I would spend $20 premium + $10 * 100 shares for a total of $1020, and I would then have 100 shares deposited immediately into my account which i could sell back immediately as regular stock right? Or would the only way for me to sell it back as profit be to sell it as an option?  If so to the first, then I should be able to sell the 100 shares on the spot for a profit of $4.80 per share so $480, or any X amount of shares I own since now they are just regular stock at the price of $4.80/share|2021-02-25 07:21:11

EPS trending up big, a top nat'l Covid tester including all the major sports leagues, owner of the HGH drug with final worldwide approvals coming over the next few mos , a crazy activist big investor in Sian Capital and a HUGE short position. Sian will start a bid war and probably Pfizer should be the buyer since its Opko's HGH drug they're partnering on. The founder owns 40% of the company and his history is build 'em and sell 'em.

opz9yg|ls42x6|ls42x6|-1|**Lucid Motors** seems like free money right now.  As soon as they deliver their first vehicle (coming in Spring), I expect the stock to rocket. I expect around 100% gains. This is a few month long play, but I believe a good solid bet. Current price seems to have found a solid floor.  Long term this easily could be a 10x bagger.  Update: OK, they did push back first deliveries to "2nd half of the year". Former CEO of Ford, Allan Mullaly told Lucid CEO, "Don't rush the delivery. This is a luxury car, make sure you get the quality right." So they are. This is good news actually (don't want them to pull a Cyberpunk 2077). So now this is a slightly longer play. I still think it's going to double by Autumn, and long term, still could be a 10x or more investment.  I like the stock.|2021-02-25 10:34:19

op8hht|ls42x6|ls42x6|-4|$GME is a top play, but acting like it is the only play works against $GME. It will create paper-hands who have all their money on one stonk and will get nervous at every dip causing an early sell! Especially all this new money. They need multiple moves to bolster their resolve through the dips!  Weed is moving again: $SNDL $TLRY $HUGE all had good movement yesterday.  $TLRY is at about 20% short interest and in a position to be the next squeeze. Spread the love, 💎✋🤚 those stonks!

opcrv6|ls42x6|ls42x6|0|While everyone will be LAZER focused on GME today (of course) there are MANY plays that are going to be elsewhere as the market roils.  Looking at the last spike and the stocks that suffered as GME rocketed and HF's had to redistribute to cover the billions in losses: those should be looked into for put positions.  We actually have time to drop those puts in at lower premiums (hopefully) until the redistribution response to GME occurs.  I would really like to do this and make some easy money but have to go to work so lack time for DD (ugh should have woke up early but was up late toasting to my tendies).  It sucks when celebrating your profits cost you profits :(  Current positions:  RKT c, 300c, 21 strike, 02/26 EXP   AAL p, 400c, 20 strike, 3/19 EXP  SHares :GME   DISNEY(long)   Some ETF's(long)  I would really LOVE to add as many puts as I could based on the previous GME spike market response.|2021-02-25 07:45:25

oqvjim|ls42x6|ls42x6|0|Hey guys,  I didn't realize that some large-cap stocks that I usually follow (NVDA/TSLA/ZM,etc.) are down like crazy today. The reason I didn't realize this is because I was riding GME up during the first squeeze but I also had puts on GSX (which I am convinced to be a fraudulent company) and you autists drove that up and blew my portfolio.  Hence little attention to trading and the market until the recent GME announcements regarding the CFO + the recent price action over the last 2 days.  The SPY is going into close today really bad - but GME is relatively steady on the day. Is GME \*SINGLE-HANDEDLY\* today causing a ton of huge funds to sell off their other positions to cover their shorts? Nearly 7 point SPY downswing today is insane!  I'm in GME because I like the stock.|2021-02-25 14:04:49

oqqgp3|ls42x6|ls42x6|0|ello everyone. I am pretty new to Reddit and have only been investing for about a year and a half. I started with Robbinghood back when I thought they had retail investors back. I opened a Fidelity account when they got on the bullshit. New buys on Fidelity and holding on RH, will slowly pull all but $1 out of RH so they have to keep maintaining the account. I have a couple of questions.  1. Comment edited based on Rule 4 2. What is the best strategy for moving my $$ out of RH to Fidelity (open to suggestions for other brokers) 3. What are the best resources educating myself on the market and how the more complicated aspects work.  Thanks everyone and enjoy Melvins cash|2021-02-25 13:30:29

oqqbby|ls42x6|ls42x6|-2|If you want to break GME there’s a process to pumping a stock. By using high call orders, the sells from boosted prices will inflated the value of the stock and circulate cash between high buyers and high sellers. In short, one person can sell high while another person buys higher. The number of stocks will be constant, the stock price is dependent on the number of circulating stocks. If you see the stock dipping buy more, and this can only work on mass. So, coordinate a price increase, where everybody sells, and then buys the same amount of stock at a higher price.

oplisf|ls42x6|ls42x6|-3|$RIOT DO YOUR OWN DD OR HOLD BAGS. THIS STOCK WAS $1 A YEAR AGO. THE CHART LOOKS SIMILAR TO HOW IT LOOKED IN 2018. Below is my OPINION, but enjoy the FREE DD.   * $RIOT CEO (**Jason Les**) - **professional poker player** and **CEO of a failed startup**. No other notable accomplishments of successfully running a company except to the ground and **never worked at any recognizable companies**. Look at his LinkedIn and tell me this is someone who can run a 5 billion dollar company.   * $RIOT CFO (**Jeffrey G. McGonegal**) - Former CEO of RIOT from 2019 to 2021. CFO of the previous company Riot took over, which was some random patent-holding company on its last breath. No experience in the coin at all and just seems like a **Boomer who's looking to cash out and retire rich**. Look at his face on LinkedIn and tell me with a straight face that he read the currency's whitepaper. **Take his CEO leadership in 2018 and refer to the below point**   * $RIOT "Lead BluckChin Engineer" (**Karl Diab**) - $RIOT's website says this kid has a Comp Sci degree from University of British Columbia yet his LinkedIn only mentions his diplomas from BCIT, which is pretty much a community college in Canada. Why did Karl omit this from his LinkedIn given its prestige over his community college diplomas? **Also, the kid graduated from community college 3 years ago**, was working internships and never worked a non-internship full-time job at any recognizable companies post graduation. Does this look like a suitable "Lead BuckChin Engineer"? You've got to be kidding me LOL, no pun intended.   * $RIOT **added a buzzword (rule 4 ban) to their name in 2017 during the coin mania to get pumped**. Check out charts, CNBC article, and marketswiki entry. * **2M in revenues for a 5B company** mining a digital asset that's only going to get **harder to mine in the coming years**   * **Operational costs (labor/electricity) of mining in US will never match with Russia, China, South America, etc**. You think electricity is expensive in competing countries with no regard for global warming and climate change?   * **Their office in Colorado looks like a run-down motel in the middle of nowhere.**. Look at it on Google Maps. They might be smoking some green using shareholders' dime there so long $WEED.   * They have **9 employees on LinkedIn** where most of them are part of the board of directors. My local factory employs more workers and has more revenues than this.   * **Only $9M in coins on their balance sheet as of Sept 2020** per their quarterly report. A 5B company only holds 9M in coins their business is built on?    $RIOT do your own DD otherwise don't complain about holding bags or buying high/selling low.    **Prove me wrong otherwise.** IM ALSO NOT YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR|2021-02-25 08:55:32

opj49o|ls42x6|ls42x6|-5|For new people in the morning like clockwork there are short ladder attacks everyday. Simply put: those that are shorting the stock are trading shares back and fourth making the value look less. That is why you hold. Buy at low, as it will climb afterwards. This pattern repeats itself daily. For those that are new this is a tactic employed to scare you off. Why? Because you selling drops the price and allows those that are shorting to reap its price drop. This is just manipulation of the market and one of the different tactics that short players are allowed to use. Much like us pushing up the price.|2021-02-25 08:38:14

oqahse|ls42x6|ls42x6|0|Does anyone have any opinion on VDRM? It's a low cost per share stock, and has seen a pull back recently.  \-ViaDerma has been around since 2014, thanks to the founding of Dr. Christopher Otiko.  \-ViaDerma develops and markets pharmaceutical products.  \-However, the company also licenses its technology to others in the industry.  \-Right now, its leading product is Vitastem. It’s a tetracycline-based topical antibiotic.  \-Patients can use Vitastem for cuts, scrapes, wounds, infections, burns, acne, psoriasis, eczema and a variety of minor injuries. It is distinct because it treats so many different conditions.  \-Vitastem is available for public use and has been registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \-Another thing that stands out about Vitastem is that it allows pharmaceutical companies to apply different active drugs in a topical format. This means ViaDerma can license the transdermal delivery method of Vitastem to others in the industry.  \-The company estimates that the market for topical antibiotics alone is $6 billion a year.  All of that aside, it looks like they have SUBSTANTIAL short interest: [https://www.otcshortreport.com/company/VDRM](https://www.otcshortreport.com/company/VDRM)  &#x200B;  Any reason this one isn't a good place to park some cash? Is there a possibility of a short squeeze here? Love to hear everyone's thoughts.|2021-02-25 11:52:27

Don't waste your time with stocks like GameStop, that squeeze has been squozen. Hedge funds that are run by homosexuals really hate it when we buy silver. Remember, primate tribes are strongest together so we all should sell our GameStop stocks and purchase silver today.

Currently they have a $50 MKT CAP with COVID behind them they should be able to get back to at least a $20M revenue run rate. Major shareholders have lockups at .30 cents. Most interesting though is the company invested into HydroFarm (**HYFM**) Nasdaq for $5 million a couple years ago. HYFM just went public last December currently trading over $80 a share. Terra Tech **TRTC** has 600,00 shares and 300,00 warrants with a $16.85 strike price. Combined that's close to $70 Million in value. AGAIN the company has a $50 Million market cap and owns Approx $70 Million of **HYFM** stock not to mention their retail and cultivation assets in CA and NV. IMHO it's only a matter of time before the market realizes the arbitrage. **HYFM** is run by Bill Toler who turned around Hostess the guys track record is of Wall St. Legends.  In addition there is a high probability that the feds will work to pass laws favorable to cannabis this year.  Good trading you TARDS!!!!  DIAMONDS ARE MY HANDS 💎🙌 .....
