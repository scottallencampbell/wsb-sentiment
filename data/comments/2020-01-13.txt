eaj0ox|eo2pe0|eo2pe0|11|**Magical Crayons TA.**  Today we traded exactly as crayon trendlines projected, [as seen here on the hourly chart.](https://imgur.com/ADiXSlC) As such, tomorrow we're likely to trade within the trendlines until we get news on the trade deal Wednesday. We're nearing inflection on the PPO so my sense is that if something bad happens related to the trade deal, we break that 324.8 support and start heading downwards. If the trade deal is signed and it's to the market's satisfaction, we break the current resistance trendline and go to the next zone upwards, which is a push for 330.   So in short, tomorrow is probably going to be quite range-bound (~328.2), likely closing around or below that number in anticipation of Wednesday. It will also be important to watch CPI-- if there's a large miss we may also head downwards, though as I've mentioned, our floor is 324.8.  Good luck tomorrow and get the tendies, all of them.|2020-01-13 15:04:32

eadhay|eo2pe0|eo2pe0|2|Hey guys, whats your opinion on how to proceed. I sold naked puts on apha.to.  sold at 7 and 8 strike. Aphas earnings are tomorrow AM. The $7 put has gone from 1.15 to 0.4.  The $8 put has gone from about $1.6 to $1.15.  Do i hold through earnings? Expiration is the 17. Iv decay is my friend as the seller. Plus I have a $14 average on APHA shares so if I get exercised against I will just hold the shares and sell covered calls and more naked puts.  Thoughts?|2020-01-13 14:28:35

So, now I have a call credit spread of 105/110 on BYND and all the gains I got from the 110 call were erased and now I'm in the red.  I would have cancelled that order first thing this AM because I could see it was going to rip, and I was right, but I completely fucking forgot about the call I sold.

ebcllh|eo2pe0|eo2pe0|1|Why do I need margin for option spreads?   To my understanding, selling a call/put can result in unlimited losses depending on the underlying stock price movement. However, a vertical spread can cap your max loss to the difference between the spread.    So if I have enough cash in my account to both:  1. Pay the premium on the option I buy 2. Afford the max loss of the spread if things don't go my way   Why would I even need margin for the spread?|2020-01-13 17:18:20
