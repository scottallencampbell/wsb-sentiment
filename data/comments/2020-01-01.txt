I think Dow fell to All-Time-Lows like 23,000.  Thanks in no small part to the Bad Orange Man tweeting "More tariffs on China today!" whenever he felt like it.   Then in 2019, when all that nonsense stopped and all of his lawyers were ending up in jail, the markets finally recovered, making it look like the year had 15 percent gains.   BUT THOSE GAINS are just what was lost last Christmas!!  === ===== ====   Anyone who thinks they are UP for the year, has been fooled by a FINANCIAL ILLUSION.

cqkkjm|eih9st|eih9st|1|Can someone please explain iron butterflies for me? For example, [this one](https://imgur.com/gallery/yWgIo8s)  is a 2/21 iron butterfly on TSLA selling the ATM 420 puts & calls and covering it $5 wide.   I can get $480 in premium for 500 in collateral (Though I will have to enter a lower limit price in order to fill it, most likely). Is my max loss on this really only $20 or I am just retarded? The ideal situation is for it to stay around 420, right?|2020-01-01 08:07:17
