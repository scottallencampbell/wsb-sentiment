The market is going to have an awful time trying to figure out how the fed unloading its $9T balance sheet will impact the market simply because there is very little precedent. I'd expect a very bumpy ride for the next two quarters and a possible big correction to valuations. Even with how shitty this year has been, the NASDAQ is still trading well above its historical average in terms of value. Still a lot more room to drop.|2022-04-11 05:44:47

4afosa|u145mk|u145mk|5|Debating NVDA calls on open. 1/25: 223.24, slight move up, tried to break lower, 1/27: 219.44, breakout up after. 2/23: 223.87, bounced up. So there's some charting to suggest support here. The only two lower lows came on 3/7 and 3/14 around 205-210, which is a pretty hard support level.   So even though I think it's entirely possible we could move back to those lows, I don't see much opportunity to profit off it. On the other hand, a bounce upward if this is the near term low leaves a ton of potential room to run upward. 240 and 255 look like potential ceilings on a breakout upward. That represents a potential significant windfall if it plays out. So I'm looking at it saying, while the breakout upward seems less likely, it also is much more likely to be pretty profitable if it does happen. So I can afford to buy further OTM on the call side and not have to pay too much for the potential.   Not something I'd go all in on, but it seems like it might be worth throwing a little money at.|2022-04-11 08:09:28

49xmx6|u145mk|u145mk|2|NVDA premarket falls to another support level. Interesting to see what happens from here. With some chart support and hitting the 50% continuation, I think it could push a little further downward. The strongest level of support is around 206-210 on the chart, which would also be a 61.8% continuation. Breaking much below that for any length of time would flash the warning signs of a serious move down toward like 160ish. I don't think that happens right now. I think the move down to 200-210 is much more likely though. Breaking below 240 and failing to sufficiently rally off it was a sell signal last week. We will see how this 225 point goes.|2022-04-11 05:09:42

4b8dkp|u145mk|u145mk|2|Then USD-Yen is rapidly closing in on 130. At that ratio it will start to cause problems. You can bet your ass that right now there are huge amounts of money piling into the carry over trade using the yen.  If there is a sudden sharp reversal in the yen, if say the BoJ steps in to strengthen the currency, then carry over trades will get blown up.  The carry over trade is like the most popular trade in the world. Literally a trillion or more dollars are leveraged to the tits on it, because it can be like printing free money.  When currencies are unstable, the whole trade can unravel. Huge amounts of losses by many financial firms, and it can absolutely blow up the stock market.  Long term capital management almost took down the entire US economy on a trade like that.  Beware of currencies getting crushed by the USD and a subsequent reversal. It could be a black swan event soon.|2022-04-11 11:28:54

Oil coming down, less pressure on consumer balance sheets, which will remain historically strong because of the extremely strong labor market.    Also this is the top of inflation. Mark my words this CPI report will be the highest one we will ever see in our lifetimes.

I'm using a website I found that calculate put position by date, strike and such and just playing with it and simulating profits. It also considers the decay. However, I just can't seem to understand what put exactly is more profitable regarding the reward AND how much is the inital cost of the contract.  I'm an actual real retard.

There high because there's no supply and no body wants to work. No rate increases is gonna fix that okay Deez nuts. The only thing that's gonna make people now is if your back accounts get shafted with prices so inflation is here to stay. Ain't no body curving nothing.
