4d68md|io4y60|io4y60|6|RobinHood changes (aka please don't kill yourself over a fake negative balance):  Our team has been hard at work making improvements to our options offering and we would like to share some of them with you today. Many of the updates are already live in your app and we have even more coming soon. Here are some highlights:  We‚Äôve added the ability to exercise contracts in the app: Instead of contacting support to exercise contracts, you can now exercise your long contracts from your options position screens. Additionally, with instant exercise, funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours.  We‚Äôve included new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios: If you have an early assignment, a new resolution flow will help guide you through the potential actions of exercising contracts or trading shares to resolve an account deficit. You can now also buy shares in the app if you‚Äôre in a short position due to an early assignment.  We‚Äôre making buying power easier to understand: We've begun rolling out updates to how buying power is shown in the app. Instead of showing negative buying power, we‚Äôll show your account deficit amount and the actions you can take to resolve your deficit based on your trading situation.  We‚Äôre continuing to expand our options education resources: You can read about advanced options strategies and topics like early options assignments in our Help Center right now, and we‚Äôll be adding more resources in the future.|2020-09-07 14:14:30

Here are some highlights:   >We‚Äôve added the ability to exercise contracts in the app: Instead of contacting support to exercise contracts, you can now exercise your long contracts from your options position screens. Additionally, with instant exercise, funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours.   >We‚Äôve included new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios: If you have an early assignment, a new resolution flow will help guide you through the potential actions of exercising contracts or trading shares to resolve an account deficit. You can now also buy shares in the app if you‚Äôre in a short position due to an early assignment.   >We‚Äôre making buying power easier to understand: We've begun rolling out updates to how buying power is shown in the app. Instead of showing negative buying power, we‚Äôll show your account deficit amount and the actions you can take to resolve your deficit based on your trading situation.  >We‚Äôre continuing to expand our options education resources: You can read about advanced options strategies and topics like early options assignments in our Help Center right now, and we‚Äôll be adding more resources in the future.  >If you have any questions or concerns about your Robinhood account, please reach out to our support team.

4c5bjt|io4y60|io4y60|15|To those of you making jokes about orders not going through today.   You will, in the fullness of time, become fathers.  Your children, initially the source of so much joy, will howl with laughter at your antics, for a time.  Once your children develop, and we‚Äôre talking maybe kindergarten here, they will begin to waver in their boundless affection for you.  Your constant, mindless catchphrases. ‚ÄúIs it hot enough for you, champ?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell son, it is what it is‚Äù will begin to grate against their inherent desire to avoid being socially ostracized.  By 12, they will actively hate you, you‚Äôll have gained weight and begin agonizing about which weedwacker string to buy at Home Depot for your particular strain of fescue grass.  You‚Äôll take to wearing polo shirts on every occasion.   You will have developed an embarrassing bald spot, your children have a nickname for it and the laugh behind your back every time you‚Äôre out of earshot.  You‚Äôll eat at Olive Garden with your family monthly, because it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs still ‚Äúa gosh darned value‚Äù.  Your wife will be regularly fucking an Argentinean pottery class professor without your knowledge.  At 56, you‚Äôll be diagnosed with a common brain tumor, inoperable, they‚Äôll tell you.  You‚Äôll weep at the unfairness of it, and your wife and children will tell you to stay strong.  6 months later, you‚Äôll have died, your battle against the disease uninspiring and cowardly.  Your wife will use the bare minimum of your life insurance payout to give you a poorly attended funeral in a strip mall funeral parlor, no one will weep at the service.  You‚Äôll be buried under an unassuming gravestone on a hillside overlooking a freeway interchange.  And nothing of value will have been lost.|2020-09-07 09:56:22

4bkyhm|io4y60|io4y60|4|Interesting. VIX futures rallying tells me that Softbank likely hasn‚Äôt been able to get out of their positions last week. Market makers over the past 2 weeks have been trying to slow down the call buying activities by bidding up the VIX in a sense making all options more expensive due to higher implied volitility. I thought Softbank already out but it seems they got stuck and will try to get out this week. Someone in the know tried to fuck Softbank up by leaking the news and gonna do the counterparty trade?

4c20fx|io4y60|io4y60|1|With a tech sell-off NKLA has GOTTA be pennystock bound, right? If TSLA is a bubble then no one in their right mind could honestly maintain that NKLA is even close to fairly valued. It hasn't been around long enough to justify a price based on its charts, and we already know that as a company it will literally never provide any actual value except to its psychopathic Elon-cosplaying retard CEO. So the SoftBank news seems like a solid catalyst to send it to the ground.      52-week low is *half* of the lowest put price ($10 low/$20p), and considering it could honestly be the poster child for everything that's about to correct in the market, 57% OTM almost doesn't even feel like an FD (**it has dropped ~40% in < a week multiple times without a catalyst this directly impactful**). But it is still priced like an FD. Great cheap play with some pretty good upside imo. Just a thought         NKLA 30.5p 9/11, rolling em out to 20p 9/25 sometime this week|2020-09-07 09:32:11

Im leaning towards it being a good thing  most etfs are buy and hold and only sell quarterly to rebalance. So most sp stocks aren't traded at the volumes and ferocity that tesla trades at. So it might be better that it wasn't included because it allows for better runs not being on a index fund  ü§î|2020-09-07 13:57:23
