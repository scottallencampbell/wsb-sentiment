They've all analogized to the GFC and said something like, even if you bought the S&P at the worst time before the sell off, you'd be fine today.   There is absolutely NO real fear in this market. Just noise. Average Joe money manager is buying and holding and is 100% certain that this is just another short lived bear market.

We understand how hard this must be Americans so all of our citizens should see an additional $2000/employee enter their employers accounts, of which you will receive $100.  Today we also announce that our population decline rate has slowed from -0.9% per year to -0.89% per year. This is cause for celebration. Chairman Robot Powell will give some words later today on this.  We also regret to inform you that the age of eligibility for Social Security also increased another year today. Citizens who are age 89 and higher will be able to receive Social Security checks.  Unemployment remains at 0.5% and Federal rates remain at 4.25%.  Thank you."|2022-07-27 13:23:52

But you get rewarded for playing as long as possible and only lock in gains at the end. It's a well proven strategy. This time is different. Market down 20% before any real negative economic data. This is unique (correct me if I am wrong).  I've never seen a time where everybody thinks they have gamed the downturn in the economy to perfection before it has even happened. Think about it.  Unemployment is at 3.6%. If I followed Bulls logic we should beable to skip an actual recession and go right to the recovery.  That's what I'm hearing as the bulls case. "Look past" all the nastiness coming because we know the recession will eventually end. I call it the ostrich syndrome.  This probably doesn't make sense to most of you.|2022-07-27 11:58:18

The faintness of the smile belies the immense happiness and relief he feels.  He takes another puff of his cigar. Takes a sip of his 20 year single malt and laughs silently to himself as he mentally recaps his masterful performance over the last few months.   On how he shut those pesky poors up with that “hawkish” talk and his piddly little rate hikes.  On how he led the Bears on with all that talk about “reducing the balance sheet” and “quantitative tightening.”  He knows today will likely be the last time he has to go on camera and string on those poors and pesky permabears. He’s already played it out in his head on how he’ll pitifully throw them another 0.75, and practices the grimace he’ll feign for the camera, as he empathizes with them about the cost of living and elevated inflation risk.   But, inside he knows, in roughly a month, he can go back to doing what he was ordained to do. What his true calling is; which is throttle that money printer back up to full blast and send the stock portfolios and home equity values of an entire generation to Valhalla.   He finishes his single malt with another swig and jiggles the ice cubes around in the empty tumbler. Takes a long drag of that cigar and exclaims, disdainfully: “One more month of this TiGhTeNiNg bullshit!”  The hot blonde make up artist kneels down and whispers into his ear: “Knock ‘‘em dead today, Jerome.”   And he gets up, straightens his tie, clears his throat, and swaggers confidently towards the waiting camera…|2022-07-27 13:07:24

This is a calm optimism before the storm. We still have plenty of uncertainty: 1) We don't know how much more aggressive we'll need to be get a grip on inflation 2) GDP will come in negative tomorrow and it will support consideration as describing the economy as in recession. Next quarter will be worse as inflation/interest costs kill COVID savings and energy costs for both Fuel and Electricity will play a large part of that. 3) Raising rates aren't going to changing energy inflation which is up over 40%! 4) Housing market is upside down, cue defaults on mortgages in a flooded market for people who can't sell their homes. 5) Jobs are being slashed left, right, and center cue further stress on home market, insane auto loan amounts, and unemployment. 6) Insurance company bankruptcies are on the rise putting further stress on remaining insurance companies and during Hurricane season cue more home defaults.

hv3byq|w9an6g|w9an6g|3|I am prepared for this question to get downvoted because it pertains solely to me and is not commentary on the market in general, but here we go — I have 10 shares of GOOG (at $119.93) and 10 shares of GOOGL (at $83.18) in my Robinhood account- do I pay the $75 to transfer them to Fidelity or just cash out when GOOG hits green?  I have 94 shares of GOOGL in my Fidelity account already and I’d love to move those 10 shares in and bring down the cost per share.  I realize this is just OCD but having shares in both accounts is frustrating to me. I’d love to empty out and close my Robinhood account.  What would you do?  Cash out or pay to transfer?|2022-07-27 10:32:38

humxq7|w9an6g|w9an6g|2|The feds screwed up. 75bps is too slow to reduce inflation and 100bps is too fast. Then we have the CHIP Act which is just a band-aid. I don't get how these companies are going to help the consumers when the only thing we are going to see is those companies just pocket the money and none of it is going to trickle down to the consumers. But it says it is going to create jobs. Like this country is suffering from a job shortage. 2000 jobs isn't going to reduce inflation. 2000 jobs isn't going to save tens of millions from entering poverty because the cost of everything is so high. Also the CHIPs act is about semi conductors. Why would normal consumers buy semi conductor products when A; their too expensive and be their not the essentials people need the most. Last, these corporations are not going to decreases prices too so there is that. So can someone explained to me why don't the feds increase IR to not just 100bps but 125 or even 150 since things are looking very bleak at this rate. Also, how is the CHIPs Act going to help the consumer (not companies) when the consumers are the ones who need the most help.|2022-07-27 08:41:34

Demand for them has increased during the coronavirus pandemic to aid in vaccine development, prompting some scientists to argue that the U.S. should keep a strategic reserve similar to the U.S. government's grain and oil stockpiles.”  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sculmu/woman_falls_ill_after_exposure_to_monkeys_at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf|2022-07-27 12:51:44

We won’t know what will happen fuck the FED doesn’t even know what will happen. The problem is very complex because reducing inflation is not even a solution it just slows the bleeding. People can’t afford to live now they won’t be able to afford to live just because inflation is 2 percent. The prices will still be increasing just slower so if you can’t pay rent now you definitely won’t be able to pay it with 2 percent inflation.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.|2022-07-27 13:28:58

And if that's the case, these stocks will see dead returns this decade. It's no surprise so many are bearish on the market. The reason is logical albeit the market disagrees.  Check the charts. Literally vertical in the past few years. Seems insane if you ask me.![img](emotet5_2th528883)|2022-07-27 08:19:27

hvsws0|w9an6g|w9an6g|-4|Things to remember:  1. you cannot fight inflation that stems from structural/supply issues with rate hikes. it wont magically expand supply it'll only hurt the businesses that could otherwise try to contribute to broader supply when things ease up.  2. savings skyrocketed during the pandemic. yes many of you have no money, but the core spenders of america have like 2.3T in pent up deposits and it's all chasing limited supply across all goods and services. Rate hikes wont change this.   They can only go so far before they literally hurt the economy - stop thinking this is some scam trading game where "this time they'll pop it with 100bps" because *that's not how this works at all.* Bear r fuk.|2022-07-27 13:12:27
