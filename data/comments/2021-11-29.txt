Maybe they are trapped this time due to inflation, stocks goes down  4th level thinking: yes, fed will brrrr and don‚Äôt give a rats ass about inflation because they can manipulate the CPI numbers to include only the things you don‚Äôt need, eventually it will be solely comprised of pocket lint, weird electronic cables with inputs nobody uses and blockbuster rental movie cases. Stocks go up.  5th leveling thinking: what if Republicans get elected in 22 and 24 and try to reign in fiscal? And replace Powell with someone who tries to reign in inflation?

I went last night and HOLY SHIT, the entire place was wall to fucking wall with high school kids having parties and playing Angry Birds golf. No joke there must have been 20-30 very large groups of kids just grabassing and spending all of their parents money on overpriced food. Add on top that every parent stuck on chaperone duty was getting low key plastered just to make it through another evening with the mistake and you got a literal money printer.

mkodfn|r4tfha|r4tfha|6|Powell dodges talking about the market or their plans for the first time today, people were expecting him to speak.  Last time this happened it was not too long before march 2020's crash, never happened any other time. Reports are noticing such things.  Of course, it happened nearly two weeks later, so if the suspicions are true good luck on timing that, could be tomorrow for all we know or end of dec. The idea is to not make it obvious something is wrong like the last few crashes, and since congress can take months to report their transactions good luck using that to get ahead. We don't have Lehman brothers to tip us off this time.(which still didn't work anyway since the majority where STILL caught with their pants down.)  Since he's reinstated Powell doesn't really have anything to lose either. Plus he can probably just evade and throw the blame on Biden during a downturn protecting his ratings, which Biden has already set himself up for.

I do not invest based on hypothetical short squeezes and most of the times there are legitimate reasons why some companies are highly shorted, but Canoo having 40 percent of its free float shorted is insane. We are in a major EV bubble, the company's market cap is 40x lower than some of its competitors that also have zero revenues and its assets to liabilities ratio is more than 3. Also Canoo is not a scam company and they are expecting to start production in 2022. They even received government funding in excess of 400 mil.

The cute little blips it experiences are fun to ride your emotions on, but some of us are in bad places, out of money, and stuck holding gme, praying just to break even. So I ask, when if ever, do we think GameStop is going to actually do something?  Position: 450 shares @ $280  Many many options expired worthless. Overall breakeven = $670/share  7 days away from needing to start selling off just to pay bills.|2021-11-29 10:54:35

My question to yall, is there anyway to find out if there is a P&D on a stock or if it's genuine hype for data?    I'm guessing no.
