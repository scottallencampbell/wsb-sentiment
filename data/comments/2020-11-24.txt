dgsump|k03375|k03375|37|I don't think people understand how SPACS work especially with THCB. I'll break it down specifically for THCB.  If you buy THCB warrants, you straight up do in fact lose ALL of your money, if the merger fails. The deadline for THCB is Dec-6. This is NOT a hard deadline. IMHO the worst case scenario in this hot market is the SPAC gets a deadline extension, which must be approved within 24hrs. All of this is in the 14A documents. Right now the warrants are 1:1 and trade at $1.80. it means that for every $1.80  you spend on a single warrant you have the rights to buy a single THBC common stock. This is a "good" ratio as warrants can be as high as 4-6 warrants per stock. These warrants are saying for each warrant you can buy THCB stock post merger for $11.50. If the stock reaches over $18 and stays that way for over 20 days THCB/Microvast has the right to redeem all the warrants you have for literally a penny each, a 99%+ lose. **However** that's only if you don't have the cash to exercise the warrant. For example if you spent $2000 buying 1000 warrants. You need to have ($11.50 * 1000 = $11.5k) in 30 days or you are SOL. This may be attractive to some people because you only spent $2k in the short term to make ($18 * 1000 - $11.50 * 1000) = $6.5k (over 300% gain vs 50% gainn buying shares)   If you are in common stock you are on a safer "investment" as the worst case scenario is that the merger fails. In this scenario all of the insider shareholders are barred from participating in liquidation. Liquidation is public and through THCB buying 100% of all shares at market value from a $280 million + interest trust fund that has enough money to buy all outstanding shares for $10 a share. In other words you aren't selling to prevent a 100% loss you are selling to prevent a loss down to available funding.   So that's about it, barring NKLA levels of scamming (e.g no lockouts, mass dilution etc), which I can go into later if people want. It's not a terrible play. Microvast has legitimate battery news, and THBC does have legitimate investors. They have several Nov 2020 13F filings from Goldman,  Royal bank of canada, Morgan Stanley, etc who have all invested into the SPAC.|2020-11-24 12:04:39

dhbeu0|k03375|k03375|6|$UAL üöÄüöÄüöÄ Someone tell me why I'm wrong to be bullish.  I'm long on UAL, I got around 17K on this stock.  IMO they're well positioned because they still have a huge (800+ planes) fleet which did not shrink. They have precedences of getting government bailouts, are managed extremely well, and they use their assets to make some profitable flights.  They claimed in their Q3 report that they aim to be at 40% capacity in October compared to October last year, and I think with the holiday season it'll just get better. While commercial flights got hit hard, they shifted to cargo and increased it by 50% YOY.  While operations have obviously been hit hard, they are still expanding and innovating. They're expanding the Polaris class, they're exclusively flying certain routes (SFO<->PVG, highly profitable techie route) and are increasing those flights from 2x to 4x a week once operations go back to normal.  Multiple vaccines are on the way with high confidence. What are the odds all three are going to fail? Remember they don't need to be 100% effective, just enough to get R under 1 so that the virus isn't exponential.  Also, in normal operations they have an income of 3.5 billion. That's a very good P/E ratio given their current valuation, and they should be able to bounce back fast.|2020-11-24 14:29:06

dgxq92|k03375|k03375|23|Like twice a week I'm behind a woman in a Jeep on the way to work, and she has a spare tire cover that has a custom piece of artwork on it. It's a blue wavy road that looks more like a river and it says "Body like a back road" all done in what appears to be "puffy paint".  For months I was saying to myself "this HAS to be a morbidly obese woman".  Fast forward to this morning and we cross the bridge and get into the 3 lane road that leads through the small city nearby. I see the vehicle in the right lane and the opportunity makes the hair on my neck stand up. I'm going to get to the bottom of this.  A recently-turned-red traffic light is all that stands between me and my hunches. I pull up slowly to the light. I see a cracked window with cigarette smoke coming out. As I get closer I see what appears to be 3 bleached Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage links clutching the cigarette. I peer over.  All of my sleuthing has come to fruition. It's a behemoth. Judging by the jowls, I'm guessing at least 275, maybe 5'4". What a fucking day.|2020-11-24 12:42:17

dgh2jh|k03375|k03375|5|   I have notably been a gay bear pretty much this whole time, andddddd i have lost a lot of money trying to be rational in an insane market. It‚Äôs like me trying to tell the psychotic person not to eat their turds. but they keep on doing it over and over and over again and i keep telling them hey you‚Äôre going to get sick if you keep on doing that. yet they don‚Äôt. it actually seems like they‚Äôre thriving. And i start to wonder‚Ä¶. should i eat my turds? i mean, i know this dude is insane but maybe he‚Äôs an insane genius?? perhaps misunderstood?? i start to question reality at this point. And after awhile i start to really consider eating my turds, and one morning i drop my pants, cuff my hand under my hole, and drop a deuce into my hand. I slowly bring it up to my lips, stick my tongue out for a little taste. It definitely tastes like shit, but i power on. i scrape a little scrap of it off with my front teeth and swallow. Hmmm yeah it‚Äôs terrible but here goes nothing. I slam the turd down now. It‚Äôs fucking disgusting but i‚Äôm ready to feel amazing. This is when i notice my psychotic turd shaman is convulsing on the ground. the paramedics surround him, they ask me if i know if he‚Äôs been taking drugs?? i say no but he has been eating his own turds since March. they scream WHAT!? you didn‚Äôt stop him???? why would i? he seemed like he was thriving! paramedics said i might be more retarded than the psycho. They said the body goes into a massive defensive state when this happens so he seems like he was thriving only because he was so close to death for so long. And that‚Äôs when he passed away, and when i started to feel sick myself‚Ä¶  don‚Äôt eat your turds yet bears ( buy calls) but maybe do??? i don‚Äôt know. fuck this market.|2020-11-24 10:34:54

dhamkw|k03375|k03375|1|Aight everyone keeps downvoting everyone posting about how the fear/greed index is showing high greed and low fear, and how that's potentially a warning sign.  Here's some free cliffnotes:  It seems counter-intuitive that low fear is a negative indicator, but it makes sense when you think it through.  SPX controls VIX, not the other way around. VIX/Fear are low because SPX is high. It doesn't mean it's less likely to drop. It often means the exact opposite. Notice how VIX was super low when we crashed in february and it was super high when we rallied in March? That's the easiest example to explain the phenomenon.  It's where buffet's super famous "be greedy when others are fearful/be fearful when others are greedy" quote comes from.   Now, does that mean low fear = market crash? No. Market crashes usually happen when greed is high and fear is low, but it doesn't mean that markets *always* crash when greed is high and fear is low.  It's just one of the indicators you should be aware of when yoloing.|2020-11-24 14:22:52

In an earlier emergency use group, control (placebo) group only had a 17% survival rate. I think this may be the most effective curative treatment for covid-19, and it fills a different niche than the vaccines and preventative/early treatments like remdesivir.
