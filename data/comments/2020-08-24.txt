2q96x0|ifmc59|ifmc59|10|   **Tesla Inc's** [TSLA 1.75%](https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ) investor and battery day, which is expected to show battery technology breakthroughs, is scheduled for Sept. 22. Tesla recently updated investors on the layout of the event with a [new link on the company's website](http://www.tesla.com/2020shareholdermeeting), detailing the day starting with an investor update, followed immediately by a presentation about progress on battery technology.  The background of the lead image used on the page gives hints to what Tesla is looking to present when it comes to battery updates. The image represents some type of carbon nanotube or silicon [nanowire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanowire).  A company working on a similar technology, [Amprius](https://www.amprius.com/technology/), explains that this technology has a much higher energy density than currently used batteries, meaning a lighter battery can hold even more charge. This could lead to cars with significant weight reductions, while keeping a similar range, or even being able to go farther than electric vehicles sold today.  **Benzinga's Take:** If Tesla has this type of technology ready for large scale production, it will change the electric vehicle scene overnight. The energy density of this technology could be so high, it could even enable fully electric planes, something CEO Elon Musk has [talked about](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1145115024114896896) in the past.|2020-08-24 15:30:38

Both bonds and stocks have garnered support from expectations he will deliver a dovish tone, adding further endorsement to the Fed's aggressively accommodative stance and that rates will be lower for longer.  Remember the dots in the SEP showed no increase in rates through 2022.  Powell won't be able to firmly announce a shift forward guidance since the Framework Review was not completed at the July 28-29 meetings.  And, indeed, there was some doubt sown in the FOMC minutes given they provided little clarity on the change, while they dimmed the likelihood for yield curve targeting.  Some of the strength in the markets might be diminished if Powell doesn't live up to expectations."|2020-08-24 13:21:05

2omojz|ifmc59|ifmc59|6|Today feels so "blowoff top"-y but I still don't think we're anywhere near the actual top of this run.  The way tech are being bought up really is reminiscent of the 1999 tech bubble, but we still have a long way to go until valuations are as stretched as they were in 1999.  That's the key thing to keep in mind imo.  Take TSLA for instance, TSLA probably needs to hit somewhere north of $3000 or $3500 (split adjusted to $600 or $700) to look like some of the tech companies did in 1999 in terms of how stretched it is against its future growth prospects.  You could say the same about any of the the biggest ones too like Apple.  Sure Apple looks stretched compared to the past 5-7 years, but it's just getting multiples that it hasn't gotten in the recent past.|2020-08-24 07:11:49

Well, I finally sold for 10.04 which is still in line with what I was okay with (netting 10% total options play money gain per trade). Shortly after I sold, the value is now *below* what I would be okay with selling.

2pmj8y|ifmc59|ifmc59|5|I've said this for a while, but LULU is gonna keep printing money until earnings.  Today was the first time I bought spreads on anything, and the Aug 28th 370/375 spreads I bought this morning in the low $200s are already maxed so long as it holds >375, so I added 370/380 spreads.  If I had more money lying around, I'd buy more like 375/85, etc.  But, there's always next week after these cash out for full value on Friday.  I'll take +150% in 4 days.  Current LULU holdings:  8/28 370 call  8/28 370/375 & 370/380 spreads  9/4 375 call  9/18 300 call (up 170%)|2020-08-24 12:30:08

2om1u7|ifmc59|ifmc59|8|I bought a 9/4 AAPL 465C a few weeks back. Sold it for 200$ loss. It’s worth like 5k more now most likely at open. I bought a 8/21 TSLA 1900C 2 weeks back. Sold it for 500$ loss. It was worth over 20k more last Friday.  I was up 8.5k in March, now down to -1.5k, basically lost 10k. Most plays I lost money on where the ones where I paper handed out and would’ve gained so much if I only held. I don’t know how to feel.

Also the FED wouldn't have stepped in buying corporate bonds. Like honestly, Coronavirus is the best thing to happen for US tech because it showed investors how strong these companies are. Without the virus we'd be focused on valuation to determine the stock prices but with the virus we got amazingly aapl to 2T. No way that would have happened without corona this year.
