3086rn|deyf21|deyf21|33| The market and stocks aside, this whole China-US relationship is getting very edgy on a Macro point of view. Fundamentally our values with them don‚Äôt align at ALL. I really don‚Äôt see a path forward without decoupling from them completely down the road. It‚Äôs actually getting to a dangerous point in time because of how powerful they have become over the last 20 years. What they are doing to religious freedom and human rights can‚Äôt be ignored forever. It‚Äôs not the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù trying to tell them how to govern. IMO it‚Äôs almost getting to a point of Germany pre-WWII. I know that sounds crazy right now, but they are starting to gain power and momentum with that backward ideology in a similar fashion.|2019-10-08 10:30:14

30vfe5|deyf21|deyf21|18|Well boys since it's nearing the end of the trading day, it's time for **Magical Crayons TA.**  We traded within the projected ranges today. As you saw we were knocked down hard after hitting resistance at approximately 291.5, however bullish sentiment remains high as we are trading at the upper end of the ranges. Barring news, tomorrow we should expect a trading range with lower highs and lower lows, shifting from the projected 291.5-288.7 today to 291-287.   *What if Trump tells Gyna to fuck off and go suck Winnie the Pooh honey nuts?* The two price floors to pay attention to are between 284-282. If we break through that, it is likely we gap down to 277, after which the magical crayons will be resummoned by the Autstic Elder Gods to tell us price ranges to watch for.

This trade deal is make or break for the world. With Trump's unmatched wisdom at the helm I'm getting more puts.   Hedging with Tesla calls for its retarded run-up into ER.

30dz1e|deyf21|deyf21|-19|Hey guys, so I‚Äôve purchased the Invest Like The Street Analyst Program, but haven‚Äôt started it yet because I was busy with school and work. I‚Äôve decided that I do not want to pursue a career with anything that the course teaches.  Because of this, I‚Äôm offering to sell this course to someone that could benefit from completing it, which would increase their chances of landing their dream internship/dream job.  The course has not been started yet. I‚Äôve erased my name from all things associated with the course, so you can input your name under the user of the course.  It has great reviews, and goes over essential topics for anyone looking to get a job in financial services. Heavy financial modeling, which is great. It counts as experience too, so you can put it on your resume, and will make you stand out from other candidates that don‚Äôt have this experience.  The original price of this course is $1,000. But I‚Äôm offering $600. Would anyone like to buy this off me?|2019-10-08 11:31:43
