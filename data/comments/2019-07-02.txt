skjfgn|c87x3r|c87x3r|62|If WSB autists had to report their portfolio earnings every quarter, mine would look like this:  2019 has been an eventful year for my portfolio. US-China trade war and a series of questionable investments has caused the balance to enter a bear trend. I'm therefore lowering my guidance for the rest of the year. Expect no profits to negative profits by the December.   Revenue is up significantly year-over-year. Trades per day (TPD) has doubled YOY.   However, expenses in form of commission have grown exponentially YOY after switching brokers from RH to Schwab.   Earnings per trade (EPT) have been lower than the Fed interest rate and US GDP combined.   EBITDA: N/A  Following the TESLA model, this growth portfolio will focus on generating strong revenue and disregard profts for the rest of the year.
