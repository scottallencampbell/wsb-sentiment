3uvyn2|di6bcs|di6bcs|1|   **Mike** (Robinhood Help Center)  Oct 15, 12:27 PM PDT  Hi Retarded Autist,  Thanks for getting in touch. I hope I can help clear this up with you.  On 9/24/19 you placed a day trade while marked as a pattern day trader and ended the previous trading day with your portfolio value of $15,508.86.  Because you were flagged for PDT and ended the previous day *below* the $25,000 equity requirement, your account has been restricted from *purchasing* for 90 days. That means you can sell or continue to hold the shares you currently have, but you won‚Äôt be able to buy any more shares or open any new positions until the 90 days are up on 12/24/2019.  The expected date for your restriction to be lifted is 12/24/19. However, we‚Äôll be able to review your restriction if you bring your account equity above the $25,000 minimum.  If you make a deposit, let us know and we'll review your account to lift the purchasing restriction.  Please note that downgrading to a Cash account will not lift the restriction on your account before the 90-day period.  If you make a day trade while flagged as a pattern day trader with an account balance under $25,000, your account will be restricted from purchasing for 90 days, regardless of whether or not you are day trading.  To avoid this restriction in the future, please review our [Help Center](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001227906-Account-Limitations). Let me know if you have any other questions.  Sincerely,   Mike|2019-10-15 14:36:39
