okntl0|lra5cg|lra5cg|309|After half a year of a trading using a mixture of my own DD/gut feelings about quality companies and stocks tards on WSB are talking up....  I have come to the conclusion that I should just buy a big ass dartboard, print tickers for every symbol on the NYSE and then just throw darts at it a few times a week so I can lose money that way.  It sounds a lot more fun tbh. Maybe I could throw a blindfold into the mix just to make sure I don’t start actually trying to aim for shit to affect results.  If this post gets a hunnid upvotes I’ll actually do this with a few grand but I have a feeling sourcing a big ass dartboard will be hard.  Edit: Since I am now legally obligated to actually do this, should I stick with the dartboard thing or pivot to leting my Welsh Corgi pick the stocks by putting treats under cups with tickers printed on them? Think the dog thing could be more entertaining from an anticipation aspect.|2021-02-24 05:57:59

That last one happened with 10 minutes left in the trading day. they left it halted for the duration. Then opened it back after hours when not everyone can trade, so less buyers means the hedges can sell and drive the price down because the "demand" was shut off, just like RH did.

At best a correction. The real bear market doesn’t start until the end of the year/next year IMO. These new bears are not my gang. You can still buy calls on VXX and UVXY.

okkl9e|lra5cg|lra5cg|52|On meme stocks:  If you have heard of it, you are probably too late  If you see a meme up 10%+ on zero news, you should be thinking puts not calls/shares  If you see a meme down 10%+ you should think falling knife, not tasty dip to buy  Dips are dips only if they drop under the meme/hype range. You are NOT “buying the dip”  just because it went from extremely overbought to highly overbought.  Now downvote me and go buy AMC if you must.

okzso1|lra5cg|lra5cg|18|So on the 🌈🐻 side we have:   • blatant, rampant overvaluations   • Rampant adoption and investment in Magic computer money (Mods can we reconsider this word ban I'm sick of thinking of dumb ways to say a now common financial asset) which is inherently Volatile AF and might be mid-bubble-collapse   • [a 127% dept to GDP ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S)   • [Over 7 Trillion dollars of QE through the course of 2020 and limited positive impact](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1121416/quantitative-easing-fed-balance-sheet-coronavirus/) (outside of the stock market highs)   • [US treasury bond yields reaching or passing their one-year highs](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx)   • Talks of another Stimmy getting signed as early as end of this week (potentially adds 1.9 tril to the deficits, further delays rental and mortgage payments til Sept, might force a $15 fed min wage by 2025)   and for the 🚀🐂 side we have:   • [big daddy JPOW stating intenterest rates will not be moving and QE is here until unemployment is back to ~3%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-powell-says-economy-could-improve-later-this-year-but-sees-no-change-in-policy-11614092422)   • Talks of another Stimmy getting signed as early as end of this week (good for sentiment, provides 15bil in small business loans)   • loan default rates expected to be in line with 2020 rates and predictions have been lowered from 7-8% to 3-4%   Please feel free to add your own input for either side.

om5d4e|lra5cg|lra5cg|8|Responsible adult tip: If you're actually in the green somewhat consistently, at the end of each month withdraw enough to cover the taxes on your current gains. Lot of people fucked themselves by making good money in 2020 and then pissing it all away in the first month of 2021; they all still owe the IRS for their 2020 gains and no longer have the money to pay it. Best to avoid having the IRS give you a six hour anal fisting session|2021-02-24 13:00:12

oktia4|lra5cg|lra5cg|12|No investment money to spend because I have all my spare cash in GME   So instead I spent $4 on some gourd seeds (not a meme I'm actually a huge fan of gourds). I want to grow super big ones and make painted planters, but I also want to grow luffa sponge gourds.  They are gourds with a SPONGE LIKE STRUCTURE inside. I'm hoping to replace the weird foam mystery plastics material sponges I buy at the store with home grown gourd based sponges that can be composted.  What's really wild about luffas is that when they are young and the inside hasn't become a rough sponge yet, it's more like squash and you can eat it. Not that I would. Eating something in stir fry that is any percent on it's way to somehow becoming a hard and dry sponge is a bit unnerving to me.|2021-02-24 07:05:22

okp9gt|lra5cg|lra5cg|3|**TLDR: PYPL TO THE MOON AFTER 8% DECREASE OVER 2 DAYS**  I think the market is mispricing PYPL on days like Monday and Tuesday.  PYPL earns a 50 bp spread and an additional transaction fee on buys AND sells of its recent trading service. On volatile days for these assets, trading volume seems to increase (panic sell, buy the dip etc.) increasing the transactions and number of transaction fees. PYPL does not own said asset like TSLA. PYPL to the moon after an 8% drop in 2 days.  Note: Not investment advice, informational purposes only. I own 3/19/21 PYPL 265C.|2021-02-24 06:16:38

okne69|lra5cg|lra5cg|6| Strategy: I came up with this idea and its working great so I thought I share it - find a trade that is about to hit a record high, you then short it – you look to gain a small amount before you close and repeat. Obviously avoid steep graphs, I’ve been doing this on DOW and it’s been working a dream. Most trades take a dip straight after a record high. No guarantees here, its jus something I worked out and it seems to be working. Don’t get greedy though, you have to be satisfied with small wins regularly – stick to your strategy and know when you’re going to close. Good luck!|2021-02-24 05:52:14

oldgqb|lra5cg|lra5cg|3|Really want your guys advice does it matter which exchange I purchase from? (Saving on fees)  So sometimes I’ll buy 0dte and weeklies and I’m not sure if the fill time is important or not, I notice sometimes I pay around $50 for 50 contracts in commission and sometimes it’s $8 depending on exchange, I use interactive brokers   My question is should I change my settings to max rebate to save on commissions or is it more important to have a good fill? As a note I usually purchase SPY puts and calls in the mornings when prices fluctuate wildly, in your guys opinion is it negligible because prices fluctuate so wildly that it’s better to save on commission and let it hit my limit price? Or does getting a good fill at that exact second matter more? Just extremely confused and want input  Also: I’m from Canada we have no free commission platforms|2021-02-24 09:55:32

omzstn|lra5cg|lra5cg|7|I'm super pissed. I sold my AMC shares for a loss. I had set aside 1000 dollars to learn how to invest at the beginning of December. I also bought 100 of the coin that shall not be named, and then sold that coin for 200. I proceeded to invest the 200 from my cripped hoe too. So I started with 1100 and instantly lost 200 when I started, but worked my way back up to breaking even. Then my investments continued to grow until I was up to 1400 hundred dollars total. I bought some NOK at 4.20 because I thought it was undervalued, but I checked my phone one day and it was up to where I had made 90 dollars, so I sold it. My account at this point in January was at 1498, but then I learned about all the meme stocks and invested heavily into them. I wasnt will to lose more than 25 percent of my portfolio so I sold all my AMC, NOK, and BBY at a loss when everything ranked. I'm super pissed now that I'm seeing it go back up. I got 500 in gold and silver, plus 250 in bcoin. I'm really considering going all in on AMC at this point.|2021-02-24 16:53:43

okus88|lra5cg|lra5cg|6|**Stock Market Lingo YSK**  **Dip**. General Definition: A drop in the price of a stock, especially after a period of price increases. General Example: “*I know you were looking at \[stock\], did you buy that* ***Dip***?*” WSB Example: "Of course I didn't sell that* ***Dip****, I used it to garnish my crayons!*"  **Correction**. General Definition: A significant drop, of at least 10%, in the price of a stock over several days. General Example: “*I think \[stock\] was due for a* ***Correction***, after all it was up 40% from last month.*” WSB Example: "There was nothing correct about that* ***Correction****- it was clearly a coordinated short ladder attack lead by The Rothschilds!*"  **Technical Correction**. General Definition: Similar to above, but used primarily by technical analysts to mean a pullback that was expected to return a stock to a trend line. General Example: “*I don’t think anything is fundamentally wrong with \[stock\], it was just way above the Simple Moving Average and was due for a* ***Technical Correction***.*” WSB Example: "****Technical Correction****?!?

okvcwm|lra5cg|lra5cg|4|Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, on Tuesday bought the 13% drop in Tesla shares that led to an around $ 80 billion drop in the automaker's market capitalization, Bloomberg reported.  Wood has achieved cult status on Wall Street, due to the outperformance of his company's investments during one of the most chaotic years in market history.  Tuesday's sell-off saw the most intense sell-off in tech mega-caps, with the Nasdaq composite ending the day nearly 2.5% lower. Tesla's stock sank after the company halted new orders for its cheaper version of its Model Y crossover. Elon Musk said he doesn't think the vehicle's lineup "meets the standard of excellence of You're here". The automaker closed down 2.2%, at $ 698.84 per share on Tuesday.  Three of Ark's exchange-traded funds - Ark Innovation, Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics and Ark Next Generation Internet - together bought 240,548 Tesla shares on Tuesday, according to an email seen by Bloomberg.  &#x200B;  Big names belonging to Ark Innovation ETF, Wood's flagship fund, like Palantir, Tesla, Roku, Square, Paypal, Zillow and Spotify, were all down on Tuesday amid concerns about high valuations. But investing strategies like Wood's gave way to a 'buy-bottom' frenzy that led the Nasdaq 100 to turn positive by mid-afternoon, when it was in the red at the close. .  “We like the liquidity it provides us, we think it's very healthy, a very healthy shakeout,” Wood told Bloomberg of his ETF teams. "All I know is we are keeping our eyes on the price and the price has gotten a little better."  Wood's main fund fell 11.8% shortly after the market opened. But the fund had already traded around 30 million shares by midday, according to CNBC, and ended the day down just 3.3%.  “The corrections are good, they keep us all humble,” Wood said. “The strongest bull markets I've been to are built on walls of worry.|2021-02-24 07:24:09

oklb93|lra5cg|lra5cg|7|Something incredible is happening with GME the last few trading days, and it's a big deal. 100,000 shorts were covered in pre market Monday which drove the price up by 13%. They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of 💎🖐 who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying "it's about to moon! Here we go!"  Nobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. 💎🖐 need to understand this and help all the 🧻🖐 retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.   Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.  https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME  **Additional details**  If you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.|2021-02-24 05:22:59

I agree that electric cars are the future and TSLA doesn’t have any legitimate competitors in that market currently however it all comes down to how profitable a company is. Firstly let’s just ignore the fact that TSLA isn’t currently profitable and just focus on the future. Does anyone seriously think TSLA will ever get to a point where you could justify its current price. It’s market cap is 3.5 times greater then Toyota right now how the fuck can anyone see that and think $700 is a fair price for TSLA stock|2021-02-24 10:26:23

olqj11|lra5cg|lra5cg|2|My new strategy (which is not a new strategy by any means whatsoever especially on WSB, but I think I finally found the right stock to do it):  Covered calls.  I just moved some money around on my play account to buy 100 shares of $SNDL. Easy, it was one $AAPL share. Plan is now to sell a call monthly for a strike at double the money. The strike price on one contract is currently $.15. This means that in one month, I'll get exercised and sell my junk $SNDL for $300 on my $150 investment, OR I'll collect my $15 premium and sell another.  What am I missing here? Fidelity doesn't charge commission... so I'm ensuring 10% monthly growth on my $SNDL.  Now, the reason I did it with $SNDL and not something else is that I want to test this strategy out without really risking anything. If this works well I'll move into a position on $NIO.|2021-02-24 11:28:52

olmkgu|lra5cg|lra5cg|3|SNDL - for those who think this is actually a good buy.  Pulled from their latest Financial report (Q3)  (Page 6) “ Sundial does not engage in any U.S. cannabis-related activities as defined in Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352.”  (Page 7) “ There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to it or at all. Any delay or failure to complete any additional financing would have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, and the Company may be forced to curtail or cease operations or seek relief under the applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws. These events, combined with the accumulated losses to date, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that casts substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classifications of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.”  https://sundialcorpprod.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/tK3jQ8CZ93QVVajmGtVf8Awp?sp=r&sv=2016-05-31&se=2021-02-24T16%3A55%3A40Z&rscd=inline%3B+filename%3D%22Sundial+Growers+Inc.+-+Q3+2020+FS.pdf%22%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8%27%27Sundial%2520Growers%2520Inc.%2520-%2520Q3%25202020%2520FS.pdf&rsct=application%2Fpdf&sr=b&sig=qaEuXjLMKmn%2BUyId%2FX2SIN1tGWWtQ0rWtbW6L3qeECI%3D|2021-02-24 11:00:19

ol6x34|lra5cg|lra5cg|1| PYPL and CSTL are the stocks I have had my eyes on for long holds. CSTL was my regret for not buying earlier this month and into Jan when I could have done so. I had my eye on it in the 60-70s before it started mooning all the way up to the 90s-100s. I felt I missed my chance. Then yesterday it dropped down to 73 and I missed my chance again because I was in a meeting and then it had already recovered to the 80s. I set a low limit now but am still tempted to buy at 81 but and resisting the FOMO.  PYPL I bought at 253 to see it shoot up to the 300s, yay! I planned to hold long term. But now it looks like I could have sold at the top and bought in back at 253! Craziness!  Keeping my eye on both. I think they are both good long holds.|2021-02-24 09:05:59

oltif0|lra5cg|lra5cg|1|Guys, everyone talking rockets about AMC.  Theater's are going to need to open at pre-covid levels to even have a chance. Even before covid they were tanking in their theater business.  Besides, lets say that by summer everything is magically back to normal. Theaters are such a Boomer thing now...they wont feel comfortable going back. Besides they've just spend the last year learning how to stream and drop the cable TV....  you might hear this and that about production but you have to be completing movies to turn profits on production. Production will start and then see at least a year before releases happen at any level whatsoever. Besides, mainstream production has been getting wiped for years now.  &#x200B;  at least worth a hmm IMO.|2021-02-24 11:47:32

om49zr|lra5cg|lra5cg|1|AMC DD:  downvote if you like, but true info. DILUTION  Bottom Line on AMC Stock  While the aggressive financings have staved off a liquidity crisis, they have also resulted in a flood of new AMC shares on the market. Private equity backers, like Silver Lake, have converted their debt to equity — and have sold off their positions.  As a result, the shares outstanding are 441 million, up about 4X since the end of the third quarter! In other words, there has been significant dilution — which will make it even tougher to sustain the current valuation on AMC. In other words, this investment looks particularly risky right now.|2021-02-24 12:53:21

Crowds have the power to create trends. Never buck a trend.   If a trend is up, you should only buy or stand aside. Never sell short because "the prices are too high”- never argue with the crowd.

Lucid Motors is an American EV company aimed to rival that of Tesla and Nio. For those of you who are in South Florida, Lucid Motors has a showroom that you can check out it West Palm Beach (idk if they are anywhere else). Below I posted some links talking about the agreement as well as the Lucid Motors Showroom:  CCIV/Lucid Agreement:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cciv-stock-tanks-27-after-lucid-motors-confirms-spac-deal-010054328.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cciv-stock-tanks-27-after-lucid-motors-confirms-spac-deal-010054328.html)  Lucid motors Showroom:  [https://tolleson.com/work/lucid-motors-landing/lucid-showroom-experience/](https://tolleson.com/work/lucid-motors-landing/lucid-showroom-experience/)  Also, before the agreement was announced the stock rose to over $60/share, now it's tanking (it looks like a general selloff of EV which can bee seen in TSLA, NIO, Workhorse, Etc.).   &#x200B;  Again, not a financial advisor, just a retard that holds GME and likes CCIV|2021-02-24 10:05:23

olhnha|lra5cg|lra5cg|-1|Guys, 200,000 GME shorts just entered the market. Now is the time to buy at a discount AND from institutions (if you are interested in gme at all that is). All the stock you buy in the next few hours will NOT be from other retail traders. This is how we soak up even more liquidity in the float. No more than 100,000 shares have been shorted into the market this week. They must be getting desperate.  https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME|2021-02-24 10:25:26
olmpfj|lra5cg|lra5cg|-1|I switched over to Webull for my trading app today and I can't find a single reason to stay with Robinhood. Webull even has features I didn't know they had, like instant deposit up to $1000. Webull is way more full-featured than Robinhood, and most importantly has a nearly all-day coverage for after-hours trading so you don't get screwed by market movements in the after-hours. They'll even cover the fee to transfer all of your assets from Robinhood to Webull. Seriously, if you're using Robinhood, switch over to Webull now before Robinhood screws you out of your money.|2021-02-24 11:01:18

People will  hate on you cost they don't want to believe it and you're raining on  their parade, but yesterday the bullish retail investors used up the  last of their cash "buying the dip". Buying will dry up this morning and  selling pressure is gonna dump on tech. Margin is at all time highs and  give it just a 3% dip and all the people who are over leveraged are  gonna get their SL hit. NASDAQ will cascade from there with more SL,  markets will panic, mass sell off everywhere.|2021-02-24 05:05:03

okvip2|lra5cg|lra5cg|-23|I know nobody wants to hear this, but tech stocks are forecasted to have negative returns over the next 7 years.   Insitutions have realised this and are transitioning to cash and to recovery plays and value as can be seen with the recent action in those stocks.   Yesterday the bullish retail traders used up the last of their cash buying the dip, and when the market opens in 65 minutes, the profit traking is going to dump on everyone and it is going to tank.   As we are at the highest levels of margin in history, a 3% decline from this level is going to hit loads of stop losses on retail brokerages. We saw yesterday that as it declines, everyone gets scared and is going to paper hand and the NASDAQ is going to crash hard. When the NASDAQ gets slammed the market as a whole will panic and there will be a dramatic sell-off.   Full disclosure: I have 50% of my portfolio in 20X leverage NASDAQ shorts since last Monday and that is going to print buckets for me today.

om45h2|lra5cg|lra5cg|-6|So I am needing to get a new car and am in a pickle as to if I should pay cash or get a loan to purchase a vehicle. So here’s my layout.  I am looking to spend 15k - 16k on a vehicle. I will be able to have the cash for this in the next month, but it will leave me with a couple thousand in savings and a couple thousand in my portfolio. I am also considering taking an auto loan instead for 5k and then having a down payment around 10k. This would leave me a with much more in my savings and more money I can invest with.  So with all this, should I buy a vehicle in cash or get a loan and invest what I won’t have spent on the car? I have never had an auto loan so that is what’s also holding me up. What is a good interest rate that it’s worth me investing versus paying in cash? Should I do a 3 year or 5 year auto loan if I go the loan route? Is my 10k down payment and 5k loan idea sound or should I do more or less? Any insight into my situation would be greatly appreciated.|2021-02-24 12:52:33

okktp0|lra5cg|lra5cg|-16|I know this is off topic but Michael Burry's Twitter handle really makes me wonder if I'm noticing a pattern of intellectually accomplished men reaching a point in life where they're tired of being the inferior gender. Especially in this day and age, for some reason. Men who are intelligent and do shit with their intelligence all seem to end up revealing some kind of gender identity issues or at least a hint of such in their midlife crisis phase.   I don't want this to happen to me but I have 2 layers of security against it.  One, I have a theory that it's because these men are smart enough to eventually realize men are less valuable than women, but it takes them such a long time it fucks up their emotional health and stuff being so confused for decades of life and maybe they never quite nail it down in concrete terms to get out of the confusion. I stopped being confused about that during the transition from adolescence to adulthood so the impact on my emotional health is more of a direct hit instead of a whole complicated mental complex. My escape from the pain will have to be in being valued by a woman, not deluding myself into thinking I can be one. Simple enough deal psychologically.  Two, it does seem to specifically be men who do shit with their intelligence. I'm ambitious as fuck but also lazy as fuck. I always thought as I get richer and my opportunities get more engaging I'll become a harder worker and it'll get hard to tell I was ever lazy, but just in case being that much of an intellectual powerhouse is like burning out these dudes' testicles or something and that's why it's always that type, I'm thinking maybe no matter how rich I get I'll keep being lazy and let my testicles get lots of rest.   Hope this helps someone but this is not financial advice, I am not a professional financial advisor|2021-02-24 05:15:43
