u22ntg|cebd84|cebd84|10|Started with 30k in March-April 2017. Went upto around 36k and cashed out of 6k  Oct-Dec happened.. **went down to  80% all time. I am still down around 47% all time**. Working my way back slowly but surely.   Lowest point was 6k currently around 14k.  What helped  1. Goal was to make $100 a day.. Burn a day trade if needed. 2. Steady job income helped a lot..Added some money and took profits to still keep the chart pinned to 30k. 3. Swing traded with 5k and just had 1k in options at any given time. 4. As the account increased, poured that money into swing trading and kept only 1k as option  Currently, 13k in swing trades with really tight stops where losses are kept to 30-50$ and winning trades are cashed out around 300-500$. All profits from swing trading are put back into swing trading at 90%. So basically if I make a 500$ profit, I put 450$ back in swing trading account and take $50 to the bank. Goal is to get back to 30k and swing trade that base. Once achieved, I have around 30k sitting on the side cash incase we hit meltdown to grab cheap stocks.  1k options. some yolos here and there. One of them usually hits to keep option size 1k.|2019-07-17 11:29:44

There's plenty of potential positive catalysts such as new management's direction (including cleaning house since prior management was poor) and 10 drugs in Phase 3 trials.  It's current PE is only 14.84 (even though I know they've got some unattractive guidance for the next quarter or two).
