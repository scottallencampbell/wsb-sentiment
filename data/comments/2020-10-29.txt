aiu9ic|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|16|Yo I'm legit getting bearish on Netflix long-term. Not in terms of stock movement, just as a company.  They were really smart in the beginning, shifting to streaming before anyone else. But lately, they seem legit retarded.  They make and license *so much fucking trash,* it's ridiculous. So fucking many netflix originals, and 99% of them are absolute garbage. You can scroll for like 10 hours and find a show or movie that netflix produces that like 5 people on earth have probably watched, lol. They suck at producing content, and they suck even harder at marketing it. Every damn day I log on and see 15 new things that I've never fucking heard of in my life. It's like an indian flea market of streaming content.  All this content, and yet they have like 2-4 shows/movies that get some buzz every year.  They're getting desperate and choosing quantity over quality, then this forces them to raise subscription prices.  Look at HBO as a counter-example. They are making like 5-10 shows at a time, make a handful of movies a year, and license new releases. And people happily pay because damn near everything you'll find there is top-notch quality.  Meanwhile Netflix just has 10,000 shows that all suck ass.|2020-10-29 14:13:47

ail92b|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|8|Lets all buy AAPL puts in honor of /u/controlthenarrative   >With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.|2020-10-29 13:13:46

ahqx13|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|7|From the wire for the AAPL holders:      * Apple (AAPL) will report fourth quarter earnings tonight after the          close.        * **Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.70 (-8% yr/yr) on          revenue of $63.31 bln (-1% yr/yr).**   * The Street is expecting Q4 gross margins of 38.2% versus 38.0% last year.        * **The Street is expecting Q4 iPhone revenues (which is expected to decline due delay of new iPhone 12 models) of $28.5 bln vs. $33.4 bln last year,** wearables revenue of $7.6 bln vs. $6.5 bln last year, iPads revenue of $6.2 bln vs. $4.7 bln last year, and services revenue of $13.9 bln vs. $12.5 bln last year.        * **The most important data point is likely to be Q1 guidance due to the release of the iPhone 12 that was announced earlier this month.** Analyst Kuo told CNBC that Apple sold 2 mln iPhone 12 models on the first day or pre-orders versus 800K for iPhone 11. The company is expected to guide for Q1 revenues of $100.4 bln (-9.4% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 37.8% vs. 38.4% last year.        * The company has not missed EPS or revenues in the last several quarters. Apple performed well across its bevy of offerings in Q3. iPhone revenues +1.5% yr/yr to $26.4 bln vs $22.0 bln estimates; Services revenues +14.8% yr/yr to $13.2 bln vs $13 bln ests; iPad +22% yr/yr to $7.08 bln; Mac revs +31% yr/yr to $6.6 bln; Wearables +16% yr/yr to $6.6 bln. Apple is benefitting from the shift to at-home work/school, which has pushed people to buy new products, apps and services. The economic stimulus measures and the lifting of          stay-at-home restrictions were tailwinds in May and June.        * AAPL has a $1.94 trillion valuation and currently trades at 34 times FY20 earnings.        * Based on the weekly AAPL Weekly Oct30 $113 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of \~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).        * Suppliers to keep on note include: **SWKS**, **CRUS**, **AVGO**, **QRVO**, **TSM**, and **QCOM**, among others (SMH); **SSNLF**, **LPL** (for displays) and **LITE**, FNSR and **IIVI** (for FaceID).|2020-10-29 09:25:10

ahoxpg|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|18|**How much $15,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**  Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out  On March 23 the price of SPY 11/20/20 $300 strike calls was 1.51. Lets say we used $15k to buy 100 contracts to hold until expiration.  Today SPY 11/20 $300 calls are at the price of 30.40 which gives us a total value of:  #$304,000  no TA, no DD, no need to monitor Elon and Tremp twitter, just blindly invest in a boring index on a dip and you can secure your retirement.

aid1q3|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|4|So I hopped off the NIO train when it last popped from 21 to 28. Although this is a very strong showing today- its based on MS raising its price in line with GS and JPMC.  I wonder if we will see further gain from a strong 3rd quarter earnings Nov 10 BMO or if this is the market already pricing that in. I plan on reentering right after the election again by buying 31K worth of 40Cs for May. I believe this will be enough breathing room for price increases based on some future strong sales figures. Exit plan is either by battery day or next earnings unless a strong increase happens again.|2020-10-29 12:19:24

ahm68k|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|2|soooo look at what happened in '08-'13 after they printed, what...1.5 trillion in stimulus? (hint, stonks went very up) We printed that much in round 1 this time, and we have another fat round coming in a few months max. The effects take years to fully materialize. I expect SPY and QQQ to double in the next 2 years. TQQQ will ~6x. Honestly I feel that's conservative if you extend the timeline to 5 years. But then we have the big depression. unless automation can create enough value to keep kicking the can and provide UBI. Thats going a bit far. Theres a mid/long term thesis for you to trade off of.

TWTR 11/19 puts were barely more expensive than 11/5 , so having the extra 2 weeks of time is worth it. 10/30 TWTR puts are way too much IV  I think TWTR 8% rise today is just due to PINS and their own report should bring it back down. I don‚Äôt know that they have figured out as well how to get money  Team tanked last time and I hate their search so much that I had to just put a bet on a failure   Atvi just have had good video game sales lately   Someone complained that nobody told them about pins , which I got right yesterday , so now I‚Äôm telling you all what I‚Äôm doing today|2020-10-29 14:26:28

aid3ai|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|0|   the last time we had as large of a change in communication technology was the invention of the printing press.  The printing press led to Martin Luther and the protestant reformation and created 150 years of non stop religious warfare which killed about 20% of Europe from 1510 to 1650.  The creation of the internet in the same way is fragmenting people who are dissatisfied with the status quo and fostering extremism but we have seen this before. While Luther first challenged the church, his followers soon fragmented, you had the rise of the calvanists and a million sects that followed. The original fake news was the printing press created the platform for Malleus Maleficarum to go viral and led to witch trials which spread across europe which resulted in an execution of an estimated 50-100k people.  We are only at the beginning of a dark age of chaos. But you go ahead and pile in QQQ calls|2020-10-29 12:19:43

ahoy5v|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|1|So Cramer turned bullish last week and now we have this words of wisdom from him for next week:     ‚ÄúShort the managed care stocks into a blue wave. The managed care stocks        then drop 10%, then you buy the managed care stocks, leading with **Centene**        (NYSE:CNC)        and maybe **United Health**¬†(NYSE:UNH).        **Pfizer** (NYSE:PFE)        goes down to $32 ahead of the election, drops to $31.50, people think        they made a lot of money, you buy Pfizer,‚Äù said Cramer.

ahhpzq|jk7d6g|jk7d6g|-4|They targeted GameStop.  GameStop.  We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the retarded trades. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little 10/30 25c down 99%. We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think bankruptcy fun. We'll spend most if not all of our time giving blowies behind GameStop stores all to fund another yolo hoping it will correctly time the short squeeze.  Do these people have any idea how many portfolios have been blown up, tendies pissed away, mountain dew two liters destroyed in frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?  These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our tendies? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their blowies else where, or even spamming wsb our selves. They think calling us retarded, annoying, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent üåàüêªs who literally root for the market to fail. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods.   Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with AMD and AAPL bulls laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.  GameStop traders are retarded, hard core, by nature. We love a blown up portfolio. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.|2020-10-29 08:01:08

My expectation for the market to hit 350+ in the next few months is still intact.  I still see the current decline as a reason to buy/stay in the market.  I think lots of money on the sidelines needs to find its way into the market and will push the market higher.  In my opinion, a Biden win is starting to scare people who do not want to see higher taxes.  It will cause companies to cut costs further.|2020-10-29 07:35:18
