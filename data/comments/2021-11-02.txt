j0ipwa|ql0v5g|ql0v5g|5|Tesla down because Musk says Hertz deal hasn't been signed.  I have wondered how Hertz could pull off a 100k car purchase along with needed in house charging infrastructure. They dont have that kind of cash, and lendors would just see it as car purchases of a mostly crappy business model with now higher operating expenses.  It's not like them being Tesla's is some kind of game changer for Hertz.  Can you imagine if the plan all along was for Hertz peeps to buy boat loads of 0dte Tesla calls, then announce the purchase that they had no plans to go through with. Just so they could make bank. That would be epic.|2021-11-02 09:20:33

j0w08x|ql0v5g|ql0v5g|2|CAR has 98% of float available to trade, most of which is owned by ETFs and large asset managers. That means it is an extremely easy to borrow security and there are a lot of owners who are willing to sell at these insanely inflated prices. Naked shorting is not to risky for this IMO, but if you really can't stomach unlimited losses then buy some short dated puts, because this baby is going to crater. Good luck everyone!  Edit: I also forgot to mention the market cap is already very high at $24M so I don't imagine an AMC or GME run up is possible because its already well above their maximum market cap during peak squeeze. I.e. there is only so much dumb money chasing squeezes these days.|2021-11-02 10:53:20

Seems like people want to sell, but have FOMO. Cramer even said the only reason he still holds it is he fears missing out when it "finally goes up". I think it's going to $80 again due to pervasive incompetence in the workforce (lost tools in planes, vax protests, etc), terrible management, and zero interest by retail along with an extremely agitated shareholder base. Anybody else in BA puts?  Edit: Google "threats of violence at Boeing" if you want some info on how shit this company is|2021-11-02 12:59:55

Since you say you already answered this question earlier, but I don't see your answer to that nor an answer to me asking you where you answered it: I repeat, where did you explain what's retarded about defining "penny stocks" as those under $1 rather than those under $5?  2. What is the point of having the phrase "penny stock" available to use in the English lexicon? Like WHAT USE does it have as a phrase? 3. What does a penny have to do with it in your eyes? Why is the word "penny" part of the phrase? 4. What makes your answer to questions 2 and 3 so valuable to you that you need the phrase "penny stock" and you need to use the word "penny" in it and you're justified taking it away from people who want a phrase for stocks that are under a dollar so that they can specifically refer to stocks that are the absolute cheapest in the market, that can't move in increments less than 1% without trickery, that may be at risk of delisting - you know, stocks where the price per share being what it is actually matters and there's actually a fucking point to being able to communicate about it with a simple 2 word phrase? 5. Do you just believe whatever's convenient for your fee fees even if you have no explanation for it, and then get insecurities and cognitive dissonance slowly building up the deeper you get into delusion, until you try to make yourself feel better about how retarded you are by trolling people who are smart enough to have a basis for each of their opinions?|2021-11-02 10:59:07
