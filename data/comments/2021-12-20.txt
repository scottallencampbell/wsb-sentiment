From what we know so far, this variant seems to be far less deadly than the others and the vaccines are still somewhat effective.

pamnrt|rkkryz|rkkryz|8|From Tom Lee (sorry for long post)-  South Africa cases are conclusively rolling over, after 25 days. As you can see:  ‚Äì Nationwide, cases peaked on 12/12  ‚Äì that is 7 days ago  ‚Äì cases are rolling over in 9 of 9 provinces  ‚Äì most visibly in Gauteng, where Omicron first surged  South Africa Omicron surge lasted 25 days versus 52 days for Delta. The strain is so virulent, that it burned itself out quickly.  ‚Äì the reported peak in cases is about the same, July 2021 versus December 2021  ‚Äì but the speed to reach that peak is half the time  And as Dr Scott Gottlieb notes, the divergence between Omicron cases and deaths is striking:  ‚Äì Delta variant caused a coincident surge in cases and deaths  ‚Äì Omicron is merely showing up as cases  ‚Äì No death uptick|2021-12-20 07:58:53

Just stuff some Benadryl into a piece of cheese and throw them to her from a distance. If we can get her loaded up with 50 or 60 mgs of Benadryl, she should be sluggish enough for us to get the jump on her. Be very careful though, as she‚Äôs a lot faster than she looks.

NVAX promised a vax for ebola, SARS, MERS, the flu, and RSV....many years later everyone is still waiting.  They never follow through.

pb5c8h|rkkryz|rkkryz|8|Omicron is the biggest overreaction we've seen since Pandemic began.  Once the data starts really flowing out of UK, we will see this thing is a massive downgrade in severity vs. Delta.  You can already see it in South Africa:  [https://covid-19dashboard.news24.com/gauteng](https://covid-19dashboard.news24.com/gauteng)  Cases skyrocketing.  ICU, ventilation, deaths barely moving.  This coronavirus is rapidly evolving into a cold.  Governments building models with Omicron spread rate and Delta severity rate.  Scaring everybody so that people will listen to their strategy.    Once the world sees that this Omicron variant is actually a positive event, the light bulb will switch on.  Suddenly we'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.  We'll have booster shots everywhere, natural immunity on top of it.  We'll be the most COVID immune cyborgs in the universe.  By late January this is all going to be undeniable.  You can't keep yelling that the sky is falling if no one is dying.  The data will tell the story.  Let the fear build another week.  Let cases start really rising in the US.  Let the markets panic.  Then get ready for the best buying opportunity since March 2020.|2021-12-20 10:21:24
