bibmn7|v6rio0|v6rio0|5|The folks hurt the worst by inflation are holders of fixed, low-rate Treasury debt.  In other words, [China](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt).  (Japan takes it on the chin too, but they're used to stagflation.)    Jacking the inflation rate to 10% on purpose, and crowing about it, would be an act of war.  "Oh no it was a big accident, we really thought it would be transitory and we really meant it, it's your friend Vladimir's fault why couldn't he restrain himself" is not an act of war, but accomplishes the same effect - when the Mandarin finally gets his capital dollar back, it's deflated in purchasing value far more than what the interest on it will offset.  There's a reason China's pissed at us, and this is it.  Taiwan, the South China straits, surveillance aircraft intercepts - just noise, smoke and mirrors.  The devaluing of the debt is the major insult.|2022-06-07 12:15:19

bivvr7|v6rio0|v6rio0|4|Strap yourself to your office chair and live there. You’ll save hella money on calories from not walking and obviously rent. You cut a hole in your chair and tape a garbage bag under it, that’s your bathroom. You put some peanuts or some shit on your windowsill. If you’re in a city that should bring the pigeons pretty quickly. You wait by the window and grab a pigeon every day or two, bite its head off and drink the blood for the vitamins. The succulent pigeon meat will be your protein. You drop the garbage bag out the pigeon window when it’s full. Bam I just saved you like 1,000 bucks a month. 👍|2022-06-07 14:39:43

He breaks down how statistically you’re really not that well off doing so in a high inflation environment but it’s one of the best of a bunch of bad options for hedging against inflation. Inevitably inflation fucks everyone pretty much no matter what they do though. Just a matter of to what degree.   Thoughts?|2022-06-07 13:20:05

bi5tn9|v6rio0|v6rio0|6|So I was simp and paid for tinder platinum just to see what it’s like.  You actually get a lot of matches. You start to see more girls in your league and it seems like they actually see you. It feels like if you’re an average dude your profile just gets pushed to the bottom of the queue and you’ll get little to no action if you play on free mode. If you pay you’ll get eyeballs on your profile and yeah you’ll get rejections but it’s a numbers game and you’ll get a steady stream of matches.  It’s essentially a pay to win model unless you’re a girl or a stud. I get it but at the same time it’s annoying ![img](emotet5_2th5212787)  I see a lot of people complain about how social media makes girls feel insecure about themselves, but I’d say dating app algorithms do the same to young men and there isn’t a lot of clarity on how these algorithms work|2022-06-07 11:34:37

bhf2dz|v6rio0|v6rio0|4|https://www.tradingview.com/x/E0YW7K0J  ES looks like we may be breaking this consolidation below.  My guess is we are pattern bound today.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/DTgF6tgv  This grind south has shown no signs of changing overnight.   Testing 4070 seems to be inevitable and I have marked where I believe bearish/bullish zones lie.  Today will continue to have a lot of noise. My guess is buy calls at 4070 and flip to puts intraday if we get back to 4085 or so and stall.  Notes for myself today:  Flip to calls if we're near 4100 -> because 4200 will be next. Flip to hard bear if we break 4070 but look for a rip back and retest of 4080 to get entry or consolidation at 4070.|2022-06-07 08:10:38

bh4po6|v6rio0|v6rio0|3|Target cutting prices will destroy their margin and their earnings per share, it’s not the same thing as slowing hiring / layoffs which is accretive to margin. This means stock has to go down and with the US being the most hawkish country in the world the dollar is too strong and it’s buying power makes it so stocks have to go down and it doesn’t help that Japan is liking their first signs of inflation in 3 decades. Plus bonds at 3%+ on the ten year. This is FEDs plan.

If CPI is bullish they'll just pump because bears will still buy puts thinking it's a "fake move" before a bad CPI print and then when CPI prints dovish we just moon more. Then if we get a big hike at FOMC, same effect - falling from a higher price and limiting the downside.   &#x200B;  either way: bullish short term to medium term|2022-06-07 11:32:02

bhnclm|v6rio0|v6rio0|1|The question is when to cover my TSLA shorts and tech shorts (ZS, S, DDOG, SNOW). I'm thinking TSLA sounds ok at 580, since I got in at 1028. Maybe even just 630 and call it a day, even though would be salty if I miss out on a massive margin meltdown if Musk forced to sell or loses fanbase over TWTR scamming.  Techs though have no idea. Got greedy with DDOG as Plotkin was liquidating and gave up 85. Got greedy with SNOW and gave up the PM drop post earnings on the guidance drop. Stuck with 4x on ZS the position initially started on by selling some ATM earnings calls that close ITM (minor loss given premium, but def oversized position). Sentinel actually sounds like it's doing well and is the worst position by far as had to average up when it pumped to $26. Idk, feel like there isn't much more juice left in these names and I get crushed on a genuine reversal but they're just so god damn expensive.
