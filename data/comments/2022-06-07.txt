bibmn7|v6rio0|v6rio0|5|The folks hurt the worst by inflation are holders of fixed, low-rate Treasury debt.  In other words, [China](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt).  (Japan takes it on the chin too, but they're used to stagflation.)    Jacking the inflation rate to 10% on purpose, and crowing about it, would be an act of war.  "Oh no it was a big accident, we really thought it would be transitory and we really meant it, it's your friend Vladimir's fault why couldn't he restrain himself" is not an act of war, but accomplishes the same effect - when the Mandarin finally gets his capital dollar back, it's deflated in purchasing value far more than what the interest on it will offset.  There's a reason China's pissed at us, and this is it.  Taiwan, the South China straits, surveillance aircraft intercepts - just noise, smoke and mirrors.  The devaluing of the debt is the major insult.|2022-06-07 12:15:19

bhf2dz|v6rio0|v6rio0|4|https://www.tradingview.com/x/E0YW7K0J  ES looks like we may be breaking this consolidation below.  My guess is we are pattern bound today.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/DTgF6tgv  This grind south has shown no signs of changing overnight.   Testing 4070 seems to be inevitable and I have marked where I believe bearish/bullish zones lie.  Today will continue to have a lot of noise. My guess is buy calls at 4070 and flip to puts intraday if we get back to 4085 or so and stall.  Notes for myself today:  Flip to calls if we're near 4100 -> because 4200 will be next. Flip to hard bear if we break 4070 but look for a rip back and retest of 4080 to get entry or consolidation at 4070.|2022-06-07 08:10:38

bhnclm|v6rio0|v6rio0|1|The question is when to cover my TSLA shorts and tech shorts (ZS, S, DDOG, SNOW). I'm thinking TSLA sounds ok at 580, since I got in at 1028. Maybe even just 630 and call it a day, even though would be salty if I miss out on a massive margin meltdown if Musk forced to sell or loses fanbase over TWTR scamming.  Techs though have no idea. Got greedy with DDOG as Plotkin was liquidating and gave up 85. Got greedy with SNOW and gave up the PM drop post earnings on the guidance drop. Stuck with 4x on ZS the position initially started on by selling some ATM earnings calls that close ITM (minor loss given premium, but def oversized position). Sentinel actually sounds like it's doing well and is the worst position by far as had to average up when it pumped to $26. Idk, feel like there isn't much more juice left in these names and I get crushed on a genuine reversal but they're just so god damn expensive. Picked them because all are STILL 30-35x sales in this environment.|2022-06-07 09:19:23
