urmopo|yk10ns|yk10ns|10|I don't see a scenario where Powell is dovish. This morning's jobs report was stronger than expected, yesterday's data was better than expected, inflation is still super high, gas was up again last month meaning inflation likely higher, unemployment is still at record low. All of these things are opposite of what the Fed is trying to achieve, and Powell has said they aren't stopping until the data suggests we're sharply headed in the right direction. We've had rates near zero for over a decade along with aggressive asset purchases. If the Fed reverses course, the situation will spiral out of control, and the US will be like Japan economically with years of stagflation and little to no growth. And along with the terrible economic conditions, the Fed's credibility and ability to tackle future crises will be severely impacted. In all reality, they should've followed through in 2018 instead of reversing course when markets started tanking. But that was a lesson learned in that a rough stock market can't be allowed to dictate Fed policy because the economy is way more broad than the stock market.   The defense rests its case. I look forward to the prosecutor's rebuttal.|2022-11-02 09:58:40

Then you turn off your phone and look out the window to see nothing but a black void that seems to pull your soul through the sockets in your skull. And you feel yourself lifting out and deep into nothing until you feel this intense pressure that suddenly stops and fizzles out as you understand you were always a part of the void.

In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3-3/4 to 4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.  >In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.  >Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Esther L. George; Philip N. Jefferson; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.   There you go tards|2022-11-02 12:39:48

"One way to think about this: tightening has three stages  1) Raising rates rapidly to catch up 2) Raising rates at a slower pace 3) Holding rates at a given high level  With this framing, there are three potential shifts that could be described as a “pivot”. "  "Several analysts have argued that the one true pivot—the capital P pivot—comes when the Fed shifts away from focusing solely on inflation to focusing on balancing risks on both sides of the mandate. Market pricing suggests this is still many months away."|2022-11-02 12:16:49

usqs3j|yk10ns|yk10ns|3|20-21 was all about going long stocks + long volatility (buying calls), and 22-23 is, and will be, all about going short stocks + short vol. This is the trade and has been the trade since the beginning of the bear market. You short stocks, and you keep selling vol over, and over, and over. Why? Fed is hiking, so bad for stocks. Okay, that's clear, but why short vol? Shouldn't you be buying downward protection in a downturn? No. You are short vol because you are not worried at all about convexity. Why not? Because the Fed has your back no matter what. If real panic begins and variance shoots up, the Fed is gonna step in and backstop the market, like they did in 2020, 18, 08. So if you can remain solvent through the variance spike (and even double down), you are all good. This explains why the VIX has been behaving "different". The market is short stock but also short convexity. This is no crash.|2022-11-02 14:16:14

urnfuv|yk10ns|yk10ns|9|Fidelity conducted a study a few years ago. They wanted to find out what individual accounts performed best. They looked at all brokerage accounts under management. The best performing accounts were overwhelmingly…   dead people.   People who hadn’t logged on in years, accounts in lengthy estate battles, and people who forgot their passwords were the three segments that had the best results, by far.  I’m now investing using these principals. I buy good sticks that will probably be around in 50 years. NO EXIT STRATEGY. The only reason I’ll sell is if I desperately need money or if i die.

usumf2|yk10ns|yk10ns|4|The melting up phase will eventually come before the crash. But in my opinion, the main goal of central banks is to keep bond yields rising without significant impact on the equity market. By doing this, the equity market can create significant demand zones that will be bought back up during the real crash. I don't know how long they will raise rates. All I know is that by raising rates, bond yields follow...and when the FED buys up the market in demand zones, it keeps equity's from collapsing into black hole.

urce6k|yk10ns|yk10ns|4|I’m digging further into the ABNB thing.  I think there’s fuckery afoot. The veneer is “biggest and most profitable quarter ever”. It’s bullshit. They cited increasing listing supply as a strength. It’s not. The hosts they depend on are getting squeezed by that increasing supply. They also freely admit their search algorithm prioritizes listings with the best “value”. Translation- the big players who can run on low margin and are already scaled get the high occupancy rates. They’ve stacked the deck against smaller players. They talked about pricing transparency, but to me they seem unaware of the widespread cultural touchstone that renting an Airbnb means hours of chores and tacked-on fees that diminish the appeal of their marketplace to guests. They’re out of touch on the issue. They also seem extremely comfortable with economically desperate people hosting, like when they started in 2008. Consumer expectations are much higher now. They’re running a race to the bottom. Add in a strong dollar hampering international performance… none of this supports their current P/E ratio. Also MBA guy can suck my fat dikkk.  TL/DR- cracks starting to show on ABNB. Running an ever-shittier marketplace. Bearish.|2022-11-02 08:45:50

She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the federal interest rate increase of 75 basis points by the FOMC. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is Powell increasing the interest rate to 4%? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want J-Pow  to be Fed Chair and fix this broken inflation problem. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was indicating that rate increases were going to stop??? This is so fucked!|2022-11-02 14:34:58

With labor market conditions still tight, inflationary pressures remaining high, and corporate profits still largely robust, the Federal Reserve has chosen to move towards a more restrictive policy. This is the right thing to do given these conditions. Having said that, this quantitative tightening is sure to cause economic pain, and it is being implemented at a time when the risks to the economy appear to be rising.  &#x200B;  /rip algos|2022-11-02 12:29:52

us2ict|yk10ns|yk10ns|2|The trend in rates is more important than the absolute level which gets priced into equities pretty quickly. If the market sees an end to hikes even if it is at 5% equities can do well. It’s all about where they are coming from. Remember if equities merely stay flat in a world of 6-8% inflation you’re still getting a significantly negative return. There is little mystery as to what the fed is going to do and where rates are going except that the stubbornness of CPI prints has continued to move the short end of the curve up. If it continues to come in very hot fed will have to keep raising and rates on the short end will continue to rise. If you’re making a call on equities you’re still making a call on CPI either way.|2022-11-02 11:42:20

Used this little rally to move up in strikes.  Also will take some expected profits and build back to 50% cash. My hedgies are not much money so will let those ride for a bit.  QQQ/SPY puts all June 16 23 exp various strikes (370/383/410 SPY, 260/270/300 Q's). UUP puts and TLT calls. TSLA put spread. Some short term SPY/QQQ put spreads. 10% cash.

In comparison with todays 85B market value.   That is why in my opinion todays reaction is sound since before the 2018 crisis began it was always a organically growing company and fundamentals and key data was always stable and sound.   Today it sits a little under fair value range 180-220. Then a slow organic share price is around 300+ in 2025.   You know when you don’t buy or sell companies like a yoyo|2022-11-02 11:24:30

Spy Calls, however, are like dirt cheap now.  Thinking of throwing some Money on 410 calls / Nov 4 expiry just in case we moon today.  410 calls because I read that we will go up 10% if there is positive news in the market.  Am I regarded? Is there something that I am missing entirely? 🥴🥴🥴|2022-11-02 11:13:53
