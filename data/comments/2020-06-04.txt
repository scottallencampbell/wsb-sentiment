sv5x5f|gwenjo|gwenjo|15|Stock Patterns              9:30 a.m.: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction (it may take a couple minutes to get going).  9:45 a.m.: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.  10:00 a.m.: If the trend that began at 9:30 a.m. is still in play, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback   11:15–11:30 a.m.: The market is heading into the lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a couple hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the market tends to "drift" for the next hour or more.   11:45 a.m.–1:30 p.m.: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.  1:30–2:00 p.m.: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.   2:00–2:45 p.m.: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into the close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, many traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stops closer to the current price.  3:00 and 3:30 p.m.: These are big "shakeout" points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.|2020-06-04 09:52:52

sut0xh|gwenjo|gwenjo|20|I had a free consultation with a financial advisor. They were talking about how the best way to make money is to “set it and forget it” for the long term. When I told them that I’m daytrading with options, they freaked out.   “You are playing with fire! You could lose everything!”  I legit told him I’m still going to do it because I trust my own guesses more than the stock market right now.   He hemmed and hawed for quite a bit about it, until he asked why I have huge positions on FANG and DAL. They have been the [steadiest climbers](https://i.imgur.com/zVhOpRn.jpg) for me the last couple weeks. Now they are the only ones I’ve been trading that are up on futures.   “You need to diversify and trade small to offset risk! I’ve seen so many people burned by the market!”  Dude. The market fucked everyone in March that wasn’t actively managing their own account. Even Warren Buffett got spooked and lost billions.   I asked him what he is doing to invest right now. “Diversified ETFs” like fuck, can you just say you invest in the X sectors of the S&P like an honest thief and stop acting like it would be better for me to pay you to invest in SPY?   Meh. I’m up 13% YTD, even though I went down 16% in March. I’m pretty happy with that. And if the stock market tumbles again, I’ve learned how to hedge positions with puts to not lose 16 fucking percent.   TL;DR Stonks only go up. Don’t trust Boomer financial advisors who only know how to buy SPY stock and wait.|2020-06-04 07:56:36

Look at this shit.  **Almost panic sold my DKNG for a 50% loss. Still watching the news closely. NBA drops news at 3:30 PM, it's basically a likely 'yes.' California is almost set on legalizing sports betting to bring in more revenue lost from Corona.

DUE DILIGENCE!  I'm in 55c 7/17 that I bought at the top Monday, at $45 🥺💔. HOLD THE LINE steady, my friends (if you're long-dated).

swdsvr|gwenjo|gwenjo|6|Milos Babic, 28, was among the first waiting in line to get into the Bellagio on Thursday morning, a place he is familiar with. He said he lost his job as a cook there and hopes to return. Meanwhile, he said, he wants to play his favorite slot machines and check out the post-pandemic changes inside. “If I start losing in the beginning, I’ll stop,” Mr. Babic said.  Tammy Bollinger flew into Las Vegas from Los Angeles with a friend Thursday for a three-day trip to celebrate her 57th birthday on Friday. Ms. Bollinger, who lost her job in an investment office when the pandemic struck, said she hoped to escape daily demonstrations and looting in Los Angeles, saying the events are “destroying our already-tanked economy.”  https://www.wsj.com./amp/articles/las-vegas-casinos-reopen-with-social-distancing-sinks-by-slot-machines-11591301973|2020-06-04 15:33:27

A month ago that number was only 5k.  My question is: why?  It hardly seems like the kind of company that RH users usually go for - it's not a cool tech stock, not a household name, doesn't have some kind of promising new innovation, and doesn't even have options.  Is (was?) it simply a pump-and-dump that somehow was successfully marketed?  If so, what did the PnDers do that made them so successful this time?|2020-06-04 15:57:02

I'm no bear, but the unfettered optimism in the market is starting to stress me out. I'm making money on it making bullish plays, but something has to give at some point, right?|2020-06-04 09:49:59

svwafq|gwenjo|gwenjo|10|Three things I've learned while trading that I want to share with my fellow gay bulls and bears:  1. Fuck greed, and I'm going to say it again. FUCK GREED. This shit will eat you alive. Have a clear exit strategy. With my account, a 0.8%-1% gain will net me anywhere between $700-$1,000. I aim for this percentage range and when it hits, I get the fuck out and never look back and proceed to feed the geese and binge Netflix for the rest of the day. 2. Buy when others are being frustrated or just overall pussies. Analyze the sentiment of the people here in this sub. When you hear stuff like, "oMg wTf iS hApPeNiNg wItH XX or tHeRe gOes mY cALLS sMh", you know it's time to start getting in. Big. You'll ultimately get rewarded. 3. Buy the rumor. ALWAYS. And sell the fucking news. I mean, this is pretty captain obvious. I don't give a fuck about news. FUCK NEWS.|2020-06-04 13:18:37

sukk3p|gwenjo|gwenjo|3|On the real, If we all accept the fact that the Fed is manipulating the market and pumping it up, then doesn’t it make sense for them to keep us range bound in a 300 to 320+ range for the next few months?  Money will be made by the big dogs, And the smaller people who simply look at their 401(k) every quarter will see that they still have a retirement existing?  I just can’t see how or what benefit there is to continue to pump us like we have the last 2 to 3 weeks+.  We can’t go up an average of 1% a day until the election.  It just seems like a ideal money making situation if you can figure out and catch these rides up and down in this channel.  And I see 3000 as the bottom since it’s such a psychological number to the mass public watching out of the corner of their eye.    (This isn’t to say we won’t see a sudden drop down to do the 2800s range for example, but I feel like that would get bought up very quickly to push us back over 3000).|2020-06-04 06:14:33

sv4x8m|gwenjo|gwenjo|3|Since wsb won’t let me post my DD - here it is before the contract price goes up to .15 a contract -   Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI) - DD - Lottery Ticket  Lazy asses who don't want to read it: ATI 10/16 - $20c (LOTTERY TICKET) - IV 55% ATI 10/16 - $12.50c - IV 65% Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI) My first one so I’ll keep it short and sweet. I believe this stock is grossly undervalued based on climate, fundamentals and technical analysis. It is not a well known stock so it will not fly up to $20 a share but we don’t need it to for this lottery ticket that is dirt cheap WHAT DO THEY DO - ATI (NYSE: ATI) is a $4 billion global manufacturer solving the world’s most difficult challenges through materials science; advanced, integrated process technologies; and relentlessly innovative people. We serve customers whose demanding applications need to fly higher, dig deeper, stand stronger, and last longer— anywhere on, above, or below the earth. We partner to create new specialty materials in forms that deliver ultimate performance and long-term value in applications like jet engine forgings and 3D-printed aerospace components. Climate - Focusing on Aerospace, Healthcare, Defense, ATI will have the opportunity to get their foot in the door anywhere. They also offer resource mining, which given the current climate could be profitable - https://www.outsideonline.com/2414117/trump-presidency-public-lands-record Fundamentals - Currently trading at around $11 a share - 52 week high - 25.66 Pre-Corona crash price - $20.41 Q1 had a good, not great earnings report on May 8th and jumped 17% https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allegheny-ati-tops-earnings-revenue-141902994.html https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/05/why-allegheny-technologies-shares-popped-178-on-tu.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo SPY that weekend also had an overall dip (yes I know its not part of SPY I was just saying there was a general sell off) Solid Openings on glassdoor - https://www.glassdoor.com/Jobs/Allegheny-Technologies-ATI-Jobs-E644.htm WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY: Pro: Zacks estimates their stock should be around $15 a share based on their TA based on yahoo screenshot above other TA isnt as good - not great but this this is a lottery ticket Summary:  1. Trading around 50% lower than pre-covid  2. Stock popped up 14% last earnings report, next earnings report 07/21 but it’s expected to be not great, but a great culture of high quality mining and aerospace can help them hopefully beat earnings and we can ride out the earnings pump ATI 10/16 - $20c (LOTTERY TICKET) - IV 55% ATI 10/16 - $12.50c - IV 65% Please let me know why I'm a retard in the comments|2020-06-04 09:44:42

suuht9|gwenjo|gwenjo|2|some DD: i went shopping yesterday in my college town in colorado... yeah the party one. mainstreat was dead af. we can now eat at restaurants so long as they seat u outside. but i was getting heckled and solicited from restaurants that used to be prestigious and popular. the fact they have to resort to yelling at pedestrians is not a good sign. i bought some clothes, they said me and my friend were like the 2nd group that came in. whilst a large part of the population doesn’t care about the virus, it isn’t enough to support local businesses. SPY probably isn’t affected, but i think a lot of businesses will open for a month or two and realise it isn’t profitable (even if 25% of the population continues to not go out). then they will close again and unemployment claims will rise again. again i don’t think this particularly affects stonks, just local businesses, the larger effect will be felt months from now when consumer spending decreases.|2020-06-04 08:11:30

suxxr8|gwenjo|gwenjo|3|COVID is gone  7:00 a.m. ET — Hospitalizations due to the coronavirus are on the rise across the country, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. [Scott Gottlieb](https://www.cnbc.com/scott-gottlieb/) told CNBC.  He added that hospitalizations are a “lagging indicator” that represent infections that occurred weeks ago, “but are more objective” than diagnosed cases, which are tied to how much testing is being done.  “In fact, they’re going up,” he said of hospitalizations on CNBC’s “[Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/).” “Arizona hit 1,000 hospitalizations yesterday. Florida hit a high number of hospitalizations. They turned over about 1,400 cases, the highest number since April 17. We’re seeing hospitalizations go up in Tennessee, in Texas, in Georgia, in North Carolina, Minnesota, obviously.”  He added that hospitalizations are increasing in Wisconsin and Ohio as well.   “We’re heading into the fall with a lot of infection in this country,” he said. “That’s going to create risk to the fall and the winter.” —*Will Feuer*  *Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina.*|2020-06-04 08:43:54

These riots have actually helped already as materials have been deployed for riots. I can tell you right now, connectors will be hot for a bit. Plus Trump banning Chinese passengers on airlines  With high tensions, this is a cheap play with high upside. Especially if shit hits the fan somewhere/before elections when budgets are being blown before being cut if that happens.   I have October $18-24c’s and are still cheap, and 2021’s but those are too expensive now.  I’ll say $20c 10/16 all the way to $28c 10/16.

I can't imagine working in the call centers down in India for $0.20 an hour in a country where police, largely funded by these international companies, have been beating those who defy quarantine to a literal pulp and then recieving an email from your employer saying the company is standing for protestors currently earning 1200 in stim money and enhanced unemployment in the poster country for the 1st world|2020-06-04 14:50:15

tifm29|gwenjo|gwenjo|1|Three things I've learned while trading that I want to share with my fellow gay bulls and bears....three things:  1. Fuck greed, and I'm going to say it again. FUCK GREED. This shit will eat you alive. Have a clear exit strategy. With my account, a 0.8%-1% gain will net me anywhere between $700-$1,000. I aim for this percentage range and when it hits, I get the fuck out and never look back and proceed to feed the geese and binge Netflix for the rest of the day. 2. Buy when others are being frustrated or just overall pussies. Analyze the sentiment of the people here in this sub. When you hear stuff like, "oMg wTf iS hApPeNiNg wItH XX or tHeRe gOes mY cALLS sMh", you know it's time to start getting in and start buying those fucking dips of the dippity dips. Big. You'll ultimately get rewarded. 3. Buy the rumor. ALWAYS. And sell the fucking news. I mean, this is pretty captain obvious. I don't give a fuck about news. FUCK NEWS.  We march until the end and deal with our problems by getting FUCKING RICH. FUCK YEAH.|2020-06-09 15:09:21
