y68g8s|cvmk3m|cvmk3m|9|One night I dreamed a dream. As I was walking along the beach with my portfolio. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand, One belonging to me and one to the PPT.  After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints.  This really troubled me, so I asked the PPT about it. "PPT, you said once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me."  He whispered, "My precious bull, I love you and will never leave you Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you."|2019-08-26 15:03:04

y524au|cvmk3m|cvmk3m|16|This is why calls are always safer than puts after a big dump.  Two major reasons:  1. markets/investors are naturally optimistic and have bought every dip since 2008 2. it takes real action (i.e. tariffs or yield curve inversion or currency devaluation) to cause a dump, but all it takes is a couple of tweets or tradetalksaregoingwell.exe to cause panic-buying  The only time it'll be safe to be short the market is when we see actual global recession everywhere and then you'll see a 6+ month selloff.|2019-08-26 06:31:02

y5bxh3|cvmk3m|cvmk3m|6|Trump refers to himself as the king of israel, second coming of God and chosen to fight a holy trade war against China. This market is fucked up. Be smart bear & bulls. take profits! play both sides! Don't play too short of expirations. If you follow these few rules and keep basic support &resistance in mind you can make so much money in this market.   Don't be a perma-everything and don't insult people who are temporarily down with their positions. Them being on the upside is just 1 tweet away.    This market can and should unify bears & bulls!   ^(But I suppose buying 2DTE OTM puts/calls and being all "**XYZ GAAANG, ImAgInE bEiNg an ABC**" is more fun if you're literally just gambling instead of putting the tiniest bit of thoughts into your plays, which would actually make you money)|2019-08-26 08:55:29

y55oaa|cvmk3m|cvmk3m|2|I've been lurking here for a few months now trying to find my way to tendie-town so I can buy a new car. I'm tossing around 14k-ish but I'm looking for a stock to act as a "checkpoint" for me to slowly add to with my winnings until I can take it out for the car.   Now, SPY is the obvious safe answer, but in true WSB fashion I'm looking for something /slightly/ more autistic. Too late for the FSLY train as I've already pulled out of that bad boy last week, but I am eyeing CRWD especially after the recent pull back. Obviously I'd choose AMD if not for the current gynese shit show going on.|2019-08-26 07:30:03

y5hzua|cvmk3m|cvmk3m|2|Opened me a TDAmeritrade account the other day, was wondering if someone can help me navigate this shit? It looks like there are two mobile apps, one is the TDA app and the other is ToS. Of these two, is there a consensus on which one is better (kinda confused as to why there are two different ones, anyhow)   Since I like to dick around at work all the time, I was wondering how TDA's web-based client (if one even exists) stacks up--or do I have to download the ToS desktop software? Would like to avoid the latter if possible (would prefer something web-based)--generally just looking for info from other TDA users and how it stacks up. Thanks, bois|2019-08-26 10:09:04

y5caq3|cvmk3m|cvmk3m|1|Sold my 287.50 straddle for a loss compared to its Friday EOD value.  Did not want to ride it 0 Day.  Fastly doing its thing, closing in on $27  Bought a Friday Spy strangle 7 points OTM but damn the put side is brutally expensive so I ended up with a lot more calls than puts but the same $ on each side...a massive upswing would be fun by Friday.  Bought a Friday Spy Straddle 3k on each side (was much more balanced price wise compared to the strangle).  Will sell this if the total position nets 2k in total profit either side and sit on the other end in hopes that it rebounds.  Passed on Ulta for now because the premiums for calls left very little room for big gains.  As of right now I am even for the day which is nice considering I had a lot of puts going into this morning.  Edit 3 mins later up 2k|2019-08-26 09:00:06
