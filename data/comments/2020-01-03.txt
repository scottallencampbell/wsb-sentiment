cx6opu|ejdzm4|ejdzm4|9|Gonna be interesting to see how Iran responds, we havent seen an act of aggression on Iran like this since the 1970s during the Iranian revolution.  To think this whole thing started because Trump is all about that Saudi dick and placed sanctions on Iran so they could steal Iran's market share. Make no mistake, this is 100% the US's fault for ratcheting up aggression with Iran.  That being said, how Iran responds is REALLY going to determine how much war premium we put on oil. The interesting thing about this situation is Iran's economy is already struggling with sanctions and any kind of increased US military activity in the gulf of oman would make it VERY difficult to smuggle oil out. BUTTTTTTT on the flip side the Caspien sea is to the north of Iran  and one of Irans closest ally, Russia, has a port on the northern end of the sea. Russia could potentially help Iran smuggle oil out.  Edit: also will be interesting to see how trump proceeds if it results in markets dumping|2020-01-03 06:10:55

The bigger story is the Democrats basically also want war, aren't really complaining at all, aka, long military stocks, this might be the start of military tendies for weeks to months to come. I bought RTN this morning at 225 but also my NOC shot up. Boeing might also have some upside, as they have an entire defense side to them, that keeps getting defense contracts.|2020-01-03 12:20:51
