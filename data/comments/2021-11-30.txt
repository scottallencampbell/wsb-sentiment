moxnh1|r5kuzn|r5kuzn|5|Manufactured news to help the average person “understand” why stocks dumped… reality is the big boys are in control and have to have backup for their insider trading.   Tapering is insignificant, we were already doing it before COVID. Interest rates are the real deal tho. Maybe there is a chicken and egg theory with the two, but probably just the big boys cashing out and enjoying their December. Maybe just rotation too. Regardless, they are in cahoots while the average retail trader holds the bags.   Took a new President for the FED to finally raise rates last time, not sure why this would be a shorter term than that (8 years).|2021-11-30 12:25:15

But then the CEO of a vaccine producing company says we need a new vaccine? Nah. It is so clearly an attempted money-grab by moderna. "Nah man, we definitely need a new vaccine. Don't worry about how much it costs, it's important!" I commented the same thing a minute ago, but that's like a car salesman convincing you that your 1 year old car is worn out and needs replacing with a new car, even though every actual mechanic that's looked at it says that it runs just fine.

Under this theory, I felt like yesterday's pump might have just been giving everyone a chance to buy puts on a discount because these benevolent benefactors in charge of the market didn't like how the omicron news came out on Thanksgiving and options traders didn't get a chance to react. So I thought the dip would continue the next day. But I didn't buy puts because no matter how many times I get confirmation that it seems true, this theory that the people in charge of the market are actually nice people just feels so fuckin retarded and insane, like easily my most ridiculous conspiracy theory.|2021-11-30 06:07:44

mnmjvy|r5kuzn|r5kuzn|5|Pro tip: if anyone you know says “the media” and doesn’t say it sarcastically, you know a fucking retard.   “The meeeediiiaa doesn’t wasn’t GME to moon” “Reeee the media spreading fear and doubt by (checks notes) doing their job and reporting the news” “Reeeee the meeDiAaa are the reason I can’t get laid. It’s a globalist conspiracy!”  None of you assholes blame the media when you make money. Stop pretending like some asshole in a studio who, again, is just doing their job, actually gives a fuck about your portfolio or is involved in some conspiracy against you or society. “Questioning” everything doesn’t make you an intellectual “antisheeple” it makes you a cynical douche bag that anyone with greater than a high school education laughs at behind their back. Seriously it’s so cringey and embarrassing.   Try this exercise the next time:  Instead of: “reeeeeee! mommy! The mean MeDiAAaaa man slaughtered my position with his conspiracy FUD”  Try: “well sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. As a grown man who is capable of exercising accountability I know I lost this money because I bought OTM calls 10 strikes up the chain and then doubled down every day like clockwork until my anus was wider than the Lincoln tunnel.”|2021-11-30 06:40:39

Everyone and their mum knows that the Fed could not continue to have such a dovish monetary policy forever and all of the indicators have shown that these levels of inflation were not seen since decades ago. When evaluating the fair share price of a stock, professional analysts use financial models that predict the performance of the company 3 to 5 years in the future and take into consideration the time value of money. I can't picture a portfolio manager  buying Apple for example and then one week later being like: "Oh, JPOW said that inflation is not transitionary, time to sell".|2021-11-30 10:02:46

The market started to show fear etc. which I'm sure had people dumping into puts/shorts etc., only for the market to act "OK" and those people to get wrecked or act like business as usual; only to start dipping mid Feb.   This time I think Covid is a background scare to get retail to pile on... but the market *will* react to taper eventually, and especially if news of interest rates too. I highly doubt we'll get anything as serious as Feb-Mar, but I can totally see a cooloff starting January...|2021-11-30 12:48:59

Put away the buy button until a debt ceiling and a stimulus bill gets passed.   In 2020 when shit hit the fan they passed the biggest stimmy bull ever in 60 days. You think they are gonna pass anything aside from a debt ceiling CR between now and Easter you dreaming.|2021-11-30 12:47:07

mnhy3k|r5kuzn|r5kuzn|-11|Omicron will prove to be much worse than anticipated.  It is a mild variant that evaded existing vaccines and natural immunity   What does this mean? Think like a virus. Put your thinking cap on your spiky little virus head.  If you were a virus, what would you do?  Mutate and replicate. You love to replicate. In fact you do it billions of times in every human host. When you are sassy, you like to be called “Delta” and kill your host. After a while there are fewer hosts to kill and a bunch of them are very hard to latch onto because they have already got you (Natural Immunity) or got a vaccine. So you head to red states where some grifter has convinced whole towns not to get vaccinated. Wipe them out.  But now what? Most people are vaccinated, recovered or dead.  I know, MUTATE!  change the way you attach to people that is not protected by natural immunity or vaccine immunity and even other treatments like Regeneron monoclonal   Spread like wildfire through the entire population showing zero to very mild symptoms and then start mutating into a deadlier form|2021-11-30 05:49:39

Lots of bad news baked into this cake (Omicron, inflation + rate tightening cycle speeding up, etc.), and it's fallen at least 10% from 3 weeks ago.

They acquired a major media company, capitalized it with the cheapest debt available for the last 100 years - at utility mezzanine debt rates, not NFLX tech-company-turned-media-giant rates, saving like 5% - and now they're spinning that debt and that capital and that capex off to compete on its own - with a giant tailwind - while they reformat their core utility business.    A well capitalized media company with low long-term interest rates is going to be a rarity a year from now; they'll have the mouse to contend with but not much else.  And the mouse has always favored cooperation over cutthroat competition; they have never tried to slay their competitors, they're all about baking bigger pies so everyone can eat.

mo8c3n|r5kuzn|r5kuzn|-8|https://dailytradealert.com/2021/11/27/this-stock-could-move-100-higher-over-the-next-12-months/        Shift4 Payments Inc. (NASDAQ: FOUR) is a backdoor play on Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite Internet service. The fintech stock stands to gain more than 100% over the next 12 months because of the five-year deal. It helps that the payment processing market is expected to reach more than $75 billion by 2026.        When it comes down to the company’s business model, about 57% of its revenue comes from merchants and payment fees. Nearly 27% of its revenue comes from subscription fees for point-of-sale products and software. Transaction fees for third parties account for about 15%.        Shift4 processes more than 3.5 billion transactions annually for over 7,000 partners, and it surpassed $1 billion in weekly processing volume back in June 2021. This has led the company to develop strong recurring revenue, up 75% year over year.        And this five-year deal with Starlink offers Shift4 an opportunity to grow that revenue even more.        Starlink is valued at slightly more than $30 billion – and its parent company SpaceX recently hit a valuation of $100 billion. The number of users is expected to reach over 14 million in 2025, and annual revenue could be as high as $10 billion by 2025.        If this kind of growth is reached by Starlink, then Shift4 will ride that wave higher.        Right now, Shift4 is trading at $54.48 per share. That’s a huge discount compared to this fintech stock’s potential.        Yahoo Finance has an average price target of $109 – a move 100% higher over the next 12 months. But once Shift4 starts seeing the money from Starlink, the stock could climb as high as $145 per share.  Nov 10th:        https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/10/why-shares-of-shift4-payments-are-surging-today/        Shift4's stock has been volatile this year, as the company serves a lot of businesses in the restaurant and lodging industries, both of which are competitive in the payments space and have been dealing with struggles related to the pandemic.        But the company should continue to benefit as the economy recovers, and the Starlink partnership certainly represents a huge opportunity.        https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=FOUR        The 10 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Shift4 Payments Inc have a median target of 105.00, with a high estimate of 145.00 and a low estimate of 81.00. The median estimate represents a +93.94% increase from the last price of 54.14.        https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nyse/four/stock-forecast        The consensus among 6 Wall Street analysts covering (NYSE: FOUR) stock is to Buy FOUR stock.Out of 6 analysts, 2 (33.33%) are recommending FOUR as a Strong Buy, 3 (50%) are recommending FOUR as a Buy, 1 (16.67%) are recommending FOUR as a Hold, 0 (0%) are recommending FOUR as a Sell, and 0 (0%) are recommending FOUR as a Strong Sell.|2021-11-30 09:38:59

mo7psk|r5kuzn|r5kuzn|-2|I think that TSLA reached the point where fundamentals and valuation literally do not matter. Every institution that holds it should be extremely risk averse to put this stock into their portfolio, cuz every financial model or ratio shows that it is very overvalued. That means that to compensate for the risk they are taking, they should expect a great return and need to be prepared to hold for a long time. On the other hand, most of the retail investors have no financial understanding and probably do not care about any news regarding the company. They are either speculators trying to make a lot of money or Elon Musk groupies.  BTW: Congrats to TSLA's early investors that holded the stock trough thick and think, you deserve your gains.|2021-11-30 09:34:45
