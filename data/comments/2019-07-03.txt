People are turning down overtime and being picky with jobs; requiring weekends or holidays off.  VS working shifts or rotating shifts for the extra OT and wage premium.  Average 2 person income is 45k-55k  Estimate real CoL to be $30k around here.  Rents are $500-$1200 for 2-3 bedroom apartments/duplexes Plenty of manufacturers hiring between $16-$20/hr starting with in 20 miles.

splkbw|c8mrrx|c8mrrx|3|i said this in q1 about tesla  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9idoa/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_april_05/ek4ymwb/  "fun tesla numbers  based on revrec standards and napkin math, 90,700 vehicles delivered (required to recognize revenue) brought in 7.23Bn for an average of $79,713/car  we know in q1 2019 they delivered a lot fewer cars  "Deliveries were approximately 63,000 vehicles, which was 110% more than the same quarter last year, but 31% less than last quarter. This included approximately 50,900 Model 3 and 12,100 Model S and X."  that's going to represent 5.0Bn in revenue for the quarter, assuming the sales mix stayed exactly the same (which we know it didn't since the models S and X delivered were reduced by almost half)  i don't know what their Q1 revenue guidance was, but they are almost definitely going to miss and by a lot  Edit: I'm probably going to do some new math tonight as I'm aware tesla gets revenue from non-vehicle sales."  turns out i was estimating high and non-vehicle revenue was significantly lower than expected (down almost 20% YoY), resulting in net revenue of 4.5Bn  based on the same napkin math (unchanged margin) and adjusted to say that revenue from non-vehicle sales remained constant;  revenue should be in the 6.34Bn range for automotive and 300MM for non-auto for a total around 6.64Bn, given the speed of the shanghai build and the panasonic issues it wouldn't surprise me to see capital expenditures way up (again). there's also less ZEV available to them and i believe they've lowered the price of their cars to account for the loss of tax credits, that represents another potential haircut to revenue and margins  TSLA doesn't do revenue guidance, just deliveries. earningswhisper has estimated revenue at 6.78Bn which i think is definitely going to miss, and EPS of (1.78) which is always a crapshoot since TSLA uses the shadiest accounting practices available, but hard to imagine it won't continue to be below expectations.|2019-07-03 15:36:17

sokimh|c8mrrx|c8mrrx|3|World economic growth is an illusion facilitated principally by population growth, industrial saturation of the planet's limited resources, and monetary policy. Sustainability has been overshot, as evidenced by slowing population growth curve, rise in climate related issues, increased demand for renewable energy, increased pollution, ecological destruction (e.g. rainforests or fertile agricultural lands), and continued inequitable resource distribution.   In the future, it will not be possible to maintain status quo policies prioritizing growth above all else. As we are now nearing a hard wall this century, the blowback will be cause for vast restructuring of society, government, and economic policy. The question is whether such a blowback will be a "soft landing" transition or the result of myriad shocking catalysts. A question, of course, which remains unanswered because (news flash) >!wsb mods are in fact very gay!<.|2019-07-03 10:56:24

Favorite swing stock   Wendy's   Bac   Ewz   WF  And jmp$   Dis$   And Microsoft   *** those are stocks no one one earth has been caught bagholding for to long as shits always hit all time highs one day or another    Be fucken patients   The market always gives u a chance to sell and tank so u can buy in  15 years I seen this    Although I have to stay adjusting my pattern as shit always hit all time highs|2019-07-03 10:29:03
