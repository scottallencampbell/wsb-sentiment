Nevertheless we're far from out of the woods as far as the pandemic goes and I certainly wouldn't buy into these sectors myself based on nothing but blind optimism surrounding a phase one vaccine trial.

They have $5.7M in short term liabilities and hold $5.2M in inventory. The short is that they stock up on inventory and stay liquid with sales.

r1amsm|glyucu|glyucu|6|Moderna was founded in 2010 to make vaccines. At the time they received government funding to make a vaccine, they had not succeeded in getting through final testing or FDA approval for any drug. This is a company that had yet to prove they could successfully treat anything. So then Trump chooses the Director of Moderna to helm his "Operation Warp Speed" thing as Chief Scientist. Naturally I'm skeptical.  But here's the thing. This dude had at least $10M in stock options on his own former company. At first I thought because he anticipated the stock to rise once he blew some smoke up Trump's ass. But no. That fucker KNEW that they basically already had a vaccine in the bag. And that he could get Trump to almost entirely remove the normal clinical trials and waiting periods required.  Human trials are out with 45 participants, and I've been scouring the info available for anything bearish to save my fucking SPY puts. But not gonna lie, to a layman it looks promising. Only 3 out of 45 people got life threatening side effects, and that was only because they got two shots of 250 micrograms each which is apparently a much higher dosage than needed to spark creation of antibodies.  We could find out that the virus has mutated, or that the vaccine doesn't provide protection for very long. But that would just mean Moderna would have to produce and sell MORE vaccine doses.  This was the final piece of the puzzle that bulls needed. I still think that reopening before a vaccine is a bad choice, but with a vaccine available in the fall, it will restore consumer confidence and Americans will be so relieved that they might overlook the Q2 earnings reports entirely.  When you begin to consider what restored consumer confidence would do, then factor in how much the M1 money supply has been increased by the Fed, the only place to protect your money from inflation will be in stonks.  Fuck am I a bull now? Fuck|2020-05-18 10:39:13

r1jowe|glyucu|glyucu|3|Hassett: US may not need fourth stimulus package  White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett (pictured) said on Monday that a fourth stimulus package maybe won‚Äôt be necessary for covering the economic damage due to the COVID-19 outbreak.  Speaking at the White House he said he thinks it‚Äôs likely "that we will see a strong-enough economy that we don‚Äôt need a phase four," adding that the administration is in a "wait and see" mode in order to calculate the full effect of previous aid packages had on the US economy.  He stressed that "if the economy continues the momentum that we‚Äôre beginning to see over the last couple of weeks of data, then I think that one might conclude that the stimulus we‚Äôve already passed is enough. But if that doesn‚Äôt happen, we‚Äôre really learning everyday a little bit more about how the economy responds to this."|2020-05-18 11:54:58

Bloody green Monday. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk6goa/daily_discussion_thread_for_may_15_2020/fqqr9a8?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  **Literally what I said three days ago:**  WSB sentiment is bearish and predicts a rug pull Monday.  Statistically, based on stats run in the sub data, only 30% of the moves and comments have been correct or profitable in this sub. 70% have lost or were wrong.  Basically, it's not even a meme. INVERSE WSB.  Therefore, green Monday confirmed. Stimulus and NYSE floor reopening being priced in. New rally incoming. I'm telling you guys this right now before it happens.   Please don't make the wrong moves. I'm 100% sure we're going to tank in these coming months (as a bear), but now is not the time. Don't make an emotional monday circuit-breaker play, because Monday isn't it. Be a short-term bull, and a long-term bear. You don't have to be perma one gang or the other. Just be rational.|2020-05-18 05:49:43

United Airlines and Royal Caribbean are surging over 13%. More haven stocks like tech and consumer staples are lagging.

Bloody green Monday. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk6goa/daily_discussion_thread_for_may_15_2020/fqqr9a8?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  **Literally what I said two days ago:**  WSB sentiment is bearish and predicts a rug pull Monday.  Statistically, based on stats run in the sub data, only 30% of the moves and comments have been correct or profitable in this sub. 70% have lost or were wrong.  Basically, it's not even a meme. INVERSE WSB.  Therefore, green Monday confirmed. Stimulus and NYSE floor reopening being priced in. New rally incoming. I'm telling you guys this right now before it happens.   Please don't make the wrong moves. I'm 100% sure we're going to tank in these coming months (as a bear), but now is not the time. Don't make an emotional monday circuit-breaker play, because Monday isn't it. Be a short-term bull, and a long-term bear. You don't have to be perma one gang or the other. Just be rational.|2020-05-18 08:37:12

There's plenty of shit that makes no sense in this market, but Disney is a great value to long term investors. Netflix had a higher market cap that Disney on Friday. Think about that. Peloton, Wayfair, the biotech stock of the week, all that shit rocketing in this is what is baffling, not Disney, which has already been beaten up.

r1o700|glyucu|glyucu|-1|As a super green day tommorow im getting sum stock. Probably at 357pm. Getting my 5000 shares in and getting rid of them at close using premarket boosts only if the stock I choose tommorow  dips again. The key here right now is that tesla might see and end of day pump or and end of day dump. Where right now I was supposed to be in the discord but I aint and they probably posting my discord account memes looking for me thinking I dissapeared thanks to shit mods. Anyway, tesla has to close low today so tommorow closes high, so I see my market entry on wednesday. Im giving the market a whole day to stay crayola neon green before going back to action it seems like the bearnado is fully gone and there isnt no bearish engulfing or no reverses. So far tesla going down so tommorow tesla is going up, whatever happens today is a freebie. If tommorow tesla is down at close at 357pm im getting 4000 shares and closing at the opening minute. In context my plays are perfect no downside, 3 minutes total in market waking up ITM sufficient equity closing in 60 seconds of  the next day. Dont play if you dont understand gain loss margin percentages and adequate spread. I know the stock can go from 699 into 845 in three days and I enter the deepest buy signals closest to the clock and get rid of them in the same amount of precision. Usually on time, or missing the bottom of the dip by 10 minutes, to avoid greed you get 2 minutes to bell ignoring the daily LOW near the bell close next day as fast as you can. have a good day.|2020-05-18 12:31:55
