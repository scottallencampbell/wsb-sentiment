It's a transfer from taxpayers in effective terms.  Look at US federal and state revenues exploding this year due to inflation.  US federal tax revenue is likely to be up $700-800 billion from $4 trillion in FY 2021 to $4.8 trillion in FY 2022.   California has a $98 billion budget surplus.

I mean, evergrande seem to have fall out of news for no reason.   People have been predicting Chinese real estate collapse for over a decade. Now for some context, in that time, chinas economy has continued to grown to the envy of the world.   Now, specifically for Chinese real estate, let’s look at some incredible numbers. The real estate debt has grown to now accounting for over 40% of all debt obligation. China’s national debt to gdp went from barely 30% to now over 80%. Also, 64% of all local government revenue are funded by real estate development vehicle and land lease and real estate account for over 70% of household net wealth. Over 90% of all Chinese MBS are rated AA or higher.   As of late, the government is reducing required initial payment for home purchase, contemplating allowing 40 year mortgage, and opening up private individually directed retirement fund.   So either China has figured out a way to keep milking the real estate growth for seemingly forever, or we are looking at a house of card with a inevitable collapse that will make the MBS financial crisis in 2009 looking like a relative minor hiccup.|2022-07-04 06:16:30

esz3il|vr3y3n|vr3y3n|3|People here think that FED will continue to be Hawkish after there is formal talk about official recession. FED will choose to resume QE and deal with 9% inflation instead of being a scape goat and be blamed for stagflation. Powell might talk trash for next few weeks or until first CPI that shows better numbers and he will turn 180 saying inflation is getting under control. FED has no control over current situation and they had their chance to raise aggresively year ago now it's too late.|2022-07-04 05:55:13

et4id8|vr3y3n|vr3y3n|-2|In the monetary model, hyperinflation is a positive feedback cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiraling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When business people perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot "win" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted.|2022-07-04 07:00:01
