bm6z4t|v7lwxe|v7lwxe|5|Important for people to contextualize market disconnect. Not that the economy has a positive outlook, but even despite high inflation there was a large shift in wealth over the last two years brought about by a hot labor market. The wealth of the lowest earning 50% of Americans has doubled in the last two years, and is 10x higher than in 2011 according to Bloomberg. For the lowest earning Americans, wages continue to outpace inflation.  This sub has a bias for upper middle class income. Retirements, college funds, those aren‚Äôt really on the radar for low income Americans. Really nice to see not only has wealth inequality decreased, but it was due primarily to the increase in the bottom half rather than a decrease in the top.

Homeboy proceeded to sit there and pump himself up in between every spin like he was going out on the opening drive at the super bowl only to lose. again. and again. he just kept betting large sums on single numbers and one color and it would end up being the other color and any other number. Then, with the last of his money, he split between reds and blacks with like 2 chips on 00. I shit you not it was 00. This idiot proceeds to put the last of it on 00 and it was black. done. all of it. gone. he was so mad after.

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

Stopped out, market mooning, switch to long spy qqq and short uvxy.  Futures bullshit brings all positions down so that my +500 turns into -$50 by open.  Then I keep the long spy qqq but switch back to long uvxy and uvxy then promptly fades the entire bullshit overnight pump.  Down another $500 on that now.  This is the kind of shit that makes me paranoid my positions are being faded.  Is QuantConnect a scam? Or is my broker flagging me every time I make 10-20 % in a single trade.  Because this shit happens all the time and I don‚Äôt believe this is random chance.|2022-06-08 10:41:03
