There goes at least one stock:  >	 Wisconsin State Journal December 9, 2021  >	On December 2, Madison native Harold Freiling was hospitalized for difficulty breathing and high fever. Freiling, who was fully vaccinated, was tested for COVID-19 and all tests came back negative.  On December 4, Freiling succumbed to his illness and lab results later showed he had the first recorded case of COVID-20.  A complete trace was done of Freiling‚Äôs contact and virologists brought in from New York University and the Army‚Äôs Infectious Disease Lab in Ft Detrick, MD, were able to locate the probable point of infection for Freiling.   >	Investigators now say that Freiling was infected at his job, a sales associate at the GameStop business located at 8118 Mineral Point Rd.  Investigators made the startling discovery that this new COVID-20 virus can be sexually transmitted when the virus was found present a used copy of Nintendo‚Äôs Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that had large traces of semen on it.

As long as I had her, there was a purpose for my life.*‚Äù  \- Nikola Tesla|2021-12-10 11:27:13

o18lb9|rd68ig|rd68ig|0|LMAO let's just close at all time highs on the S&P on the day we get news of inflation setting a massive record for the highest in the last 30 years...Pile that on top of a slowing economy with an unending pandemic and low job numbers. Did I mention inflation is actually expected to go much higher in 2022? Oh, nevermind the Fed having the highest balance sheet in history by a long shot or this stock market being the most bought on margin market in history. Also, by nearly every fundamental indicator we are either the highest in market history or near highest. EXTREMELY overpriced market. I guarantee we will see a 50%+ market crash with 80% being a real possibility. Days like today are the days I really start getting fearful. When there's greed enough to buy at all time highs after 6.8% CPI has dropped, you know there is 0 rationalization left in the markets. Next week Fed meeting, I'm predicting a much quicker taper being talked about and interest rates coming much faster and stronger than predicted. It's going to be a wild ride in this next year. Buy as many puts as you can and enjoy the show     üåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêªüåàüêª|2021-12-10 14:53:36

nzv6n4|rd68ig|rd68ig|-11|There are kids of various ages in school right now who have spent almost 2 years being like "I'm gonna go to college for medical research and be the doctor that cures covid someday" and getting laughed at for various reasons   Let's follow little Timmy for example  Early on, Timmy's parents laughed at him because supposedly covid would already be gone by the time he could become a doctor  His English teacher laughed at him, accusing him of hyping all this up to try to get school closed   Fellow students ran with this accusation. When his school did close, Timmy was happy about it, and other students laughed at him as if this confirmed that all he wanted was a free break from school after all.  Some random homeless guy on the subway got into a conversation with Timmy's dad about covid. When Timmy got involved in the conversation and brought up his ambitions, the homeless man laughed at him, saying the corrupt medical industry had such a tight grip on colleges and universities they would never let him touch a cure for covid with a 10 foot poll.  Timmy remembered that.  When school reopened after the summer, the other students laughed at Timmy for protesting, telling him covid would be gone soon anyway.  At the start of the year, before seeing little Timmy ace every test in his class and show an aptitude beyond his years, Timmy's biology teacher laughed at him for thinking he could ever beat the lifelong scientists who have such a head start on him trying to solve the problem.  Strangers on the internet have laughed at little Timmy for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes they say he's an idiot for believing covid exists. Sometimes they say covid is just a flu and nobody's been able to cure the flu. He once bragged about his intelligence and his grades on reddit and got downvoted to shit.  Now, having gotten to know little Timmy, his biology teacher still laughs at him because if covid lasts long enough for him to become a doctor, it will be biologically impossible for it to ever go away.   But I believe in little Timmy. He'll be a world-class doctor. His greatest fear is that last argument - the only one that sounds like it might be true. Timmy is scared no matter how good of a doctor he is, maybe nobody can undo how the world has forever been changed. But I know he has it in him. Someday little Timmy will realize he is a smart enough doctor to figure out a cure for covid.   And the most earth shattering moment of little Timmy's life will be when he finds out it was the homeless man on the subway who got it right after all. Which means little Timmy was only one of thousands of kids who could cure covid someday. There were others like him at other schools all across America. And none of them would ever achieve their dreams of taking credit for the end of the pandemic.|2021-12-10 09:25:34
