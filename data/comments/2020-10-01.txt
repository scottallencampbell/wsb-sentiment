7atgs7|j35to3|j35to3|3|I had a very lucky morning. Was holding a ZM $465 put. Get a call that wakes me up way too early pre market. Send it to voicemail. Check premarket and see ZM up. Shit. Throw in a limit order to sell my put at breakeven not thinking it'll hit. Go back to sleep. Wake up and I basically sold the high on the put before the rally resumed while still sleeping.   Set an order to lock in my IWM call gains at the same time and sold the high there too. Literally 0.02 off the high.  Was holding 20/17 NKLA put spreads. Bought back the 17s near the high before this little sell off. I have my doubts that we'll see <$20 before end of day tomorrow but at least i took most of the gain on the 17s and now have an unhedged long put position to watch.    &#x200B;  Watched VXX rocket without much movement in SPY.

7a0z2h|j35to3|j35to3|5| fellas i want to recap quickly what happened the last few days  trump / biden "debate" and its widely agreed that this debate was a disaster, futures respond by dumping over 1% immediately  by 5am, the PPT steps in and pushes the market into green by open in the span of 2 hours  next day we get stimulus hopes which pumps the market almost 2%, we all know its not gonna happen and when news comes out that stimmy has failed, the market loses its gains but the dip is bought up and still ends the day up 1% on fake news  as soon as futures open yesterday, the PPT immediately pumps the market up .5% in the span of a minute on basically no volume, pushing the market over the 50 day moving average, which for you fellas who dont know, is a big resistance point for algos and will trigger them to buy, now we are opening up back to yesterdays high  tldr; buy calls, shits clearly being rigged right now, i havent seen futures this blatantly manipulated in a while|2020-10-01 07:16:31

7a4rc1|j35to3|j35to3|3|I would say this is DD but in reality it's just self assurance I'm spewing at strangers over reddit. But this is why I'm fully invested in LEAPS. Several years ago Warren Buffet made a 1m bet with a hedge fund that they couldn't out preform the S&P in the span of a year and he was right. Index funds have been able to produce some of the best and most consistent returns throughout history, so why not capitalize on their returns through the greeks via options? The trick is finding a strike that's not completely unfathomable at a far enough expiration, making sure you have a slightly decent delta to theta ratio and that there's enough liquidity to get filled at a proper price. Buy on a red day and fucking hold, set a stop you're comfortable with and forget about it until 30-45 days out because that's when theta really kicks in and if you aren't comfortable with your returns then just roll your contract. Someone point out to me the biggest risks here pls|2020-10-01 07:59:37

7anqpa|j35to3|j35to3|2|Hi guys, I'm new here, I saw this brand new stock on TikTok called NKLA, I heard they are going to beat Tesla in a few years, it was "1 of 10 Elon Musk's biggest fears!". They went up 30% today, should I fomo and dump my life savings into it? Currently have about $2000 that I saved over the past 5 years working at Wendy's drive thru. I only need to make about $11 million to have the life I want, so how long do you nice gentleman think it will take for NKLA to make me that much money? Also at $26 it is so much cheaper than Tesla's $440 price tag!|2020-10-01 10:38:32
