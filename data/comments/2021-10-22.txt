Just Apple changing its policy made SNAP go down 22% — so, so many of these names are heavily reliant on stealing your data for targeted marketing.   I think Apple changed its policy because the writing is on the wall: collecting data without asking was a pretty obvious privacy violation with heavy regulatory risk.

Two weeks ago we almost run out of money, and a new investor comes in to rescue us. He gives us this rah rah speech saying he put in hundreds of thousands of dollars to get everyone paid up through the year, and has a 5 hour meeting with us establishing quarterly goals.  Comes back in on Monday and has the same type of meeting with us.   Tuesday that mother fucker holds an emergency board meeting and calls a vote to liquidate which passes 9:1. For two days I’m scrambling trying to find a new income.  Thursday that brilliant mother fucker resigns from the board, and offers to buy the company for pennies on the dollar.

M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.        Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.The mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines, while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.|2021-10-22 08:17:15

hmxudm|qddlkc|qddlkc|12|Unpopular opinion (probably) :   I don’t know if most of you can’t put two and two together, but once DWAC allows for options trading, and then when the platform actually releases, it’s going to go up more than it has these last two days.   Not saying it’s necessarily a long term hold at this price, but for a short time when options are available/when the platform actually drops, it’s going to go up more.   Plus a lot of Trumps base will use the platform so DWAC is going to maintain a solid price for that reason itself|2021-10-22 11:21:00

hmgw2a|qddlkc|qddlkc|7|I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This fall I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into Southern American mango futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another fruit. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's mango yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Alabama and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the mango bubble burst on Oct 22. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for Halloween, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of Oct 22nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive mango shipment from Kentucky, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the mangos in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.|2021-10-22 09:26:46

U jerk off so often that I think u have a particular technique, or it's unclear how your shaft is still okay. If u come across a man like u on the street, you won't think that, being alone, he practices that. Ur tenacity in ur creepy delights shocks me. But actually it's all is not related to our deal. When we're done, you would rather pay attention to you security, and begin at least covering the camera. In case you defy my claims, within 90 hours u'd better get out of the country and change ur name, anyway u will no longer be able to live your former life. There is no other way, I am not going to review my requisitions, there's no use to text me, I'll delete the present email address. The timer starts now.|2021-10-22 08:55:42

The outlet, which is backed by People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, didn’t offer further details. The payment came with just one day left on a 30-day grace period to avoid a default. The company gripped global financial markets a month ago when it skipped a payment to foreign bondholders, raising the prospect that it could leave global investors with billions of dollars in losses and cause ripples within China’s property market, a key component of the country’s economic growth engine."|2021-10-22 14:37:40

hmkocr|qddlkc|qddlkc|-9|Ok fellows apes. I haven't been much active in here ever since GME, but today I decided to comment because I believe there's something truly important about to go on. Please let me know if you think I should make this a post.   I'm a health care worker in Portugal, the world's most vaccinated country, with more than 90% fully vaccinated. Despite this incredible vaccination rate, with many older people already getting their booster shots, we're actually seeing an increasing in the number of daily COVID cases for the last days. This is due to a number of factors, specially a new Delta variant mutation and the end of summer.   This trend is also going on in many countries around the world right now. The UK is having a major comeback of daily cases and Puttin had to give one week off to Russian workers to try and stop a similar new wave. I wholeheartedly hope I'm wrong here, but if things keep going in this direction,  within the next 30 days Europe will be going into a winter with chaos at hospitals, out of control inflation and now natural gas to heat homes.   Giving the many other uncertainties going on around markets right now, I believe a new wave of infections would have devastating effects on the markets. While this can lead to losses, it also means there would be opportunities for buying massive dips.   This is not financial advice. I'm in no way as experienced as many in here, but this community has been great to me and I feel like many here aren't aware of this rapidly growing risk.|2021-10-22 09:52:10
