k89oi5|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|13|I'm not GME gang, but I've been watching it from the beginning and rooting for you retards, if not always believing. You really are some special kind of hive mind. Even if it's only once, you bull-rushed into the market and pillaged the coffers of the old guard like a bunch of fuckin Ritalin-juiced Visigoths. And unlike almost all other meme crews I've seen go toxic in here since the market crashed, you've been nothing but jovial through every up and down just legitimately having fun with the ride. To me that's the true spirit of WSB, and you all deserve today no matter how much you're in for. If you make life-changing money this week, write a short journal entry about it for you to look back on and relish this victory, because it's a bona fide conquest. I hope it ain't the last. And DFV wherever you are, you're a fuckin' legend mate. NostraGaMEs, Slayer of Shitron|2021-01-22 13:49:10

It's not even the best dating app out there. I think this trying to cash out while markets are hot is going to have a ripple effect. Add on this the bubble on SPACs.

k6ay4h|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|12|Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental Lemons yield in recorded history.

k6z6wj|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|27|By no means am I am OG. I’ve only been lurking since 2015. If you had a stupid question you were told to go fuck yourself. The video game company attention is BAD. You are NOT cool for trolling  Andrew Left. The last time a member of this sub got popular (Martin) they deleted his YouTube finance tutorials and google drive. This sub is turning into full Stocktwats where I feel like I am in a normie TikTok cesspool and not 4chan x Bloomberg. Inverse WSB doesn’t even exist anymore because if someone gets puts on a popular stock they’re downvoted to shit. For the love of all things autistic mods pls have a fucking paper trading competition. I am fucking sick of hearing the same 3-4 tickers on repeat. I don’t need to see 1000 DDs on a video game company. We get it $BB is cool, you’re so edgy and spamming it every few seconds will totally get it to $15 EOD. The good DD gets buried now in a flurry of 10s of the exact same ticker DD. The good DD in this comment section that used to exist doesn’t anymore or gets buried by “$Ticker🚀🚀” or “$Stock 1,000,000 EOD”. It was funny at first and I loved the rockets but it’s annoying now, .05% isn’t 🚀. I don’t really even post DD anymore because everyone is circle jerking 10 stocks. I commented on the other daily thread once to gauge the retardation and it’s off the charts.   To any new kid who came here because they wanted to make money (or lose)  here are some plays I am in that aren’t what everyone has.  $DASH 175p 2/12  $AUPH shares (burn a daytrade) (they’re either going up or crashing today)  $TRP 40p 2/19 (keystone pipeline)   DON’T TALK TO THE MEDIA. THEY AREN’T YOUR FRIEND.  Andrew Left and Melvin don’t matter, we used to not care about the person just our own side of the trade.   Fuck your micropenis positions, Fuck your stock TikTok, Fuck Cramer, Fuck the Twitter account, Fuck the Instagram account, and most importantly if you’re pumping a stock [POSITIONS OR BAN](https://imgur.com/a/Ozq5uQ3)|2021-01-22 10:00:27

Not only that, but 99% of Veterinarians chose their career path because they love animals. And most of them end up euthanizing as many animals as they help 😞.    It's emotionally draining to wear a Cloak of Death every day and many clients are unappreciative or unfortunately don't understand the costs of running a medical practice.  Anyways, may your tendies be crispy. If your an animal lover like myself, please consider sending some hot tendies(or pizza, or brownies, or a fruit basket) to your local Vet Clinic or Hospital.|2021-01-22 06:43:45

k6d76o|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|9|last time i'll post this  Just a heads up what direction this sub is moving towards with all this mainstream coverage and normies invading I received this pm on reddit after saying NOK is a shit play yesterday  https://i.imgur.com/tUhyV7p.png  I transcribed the image below   "Why does everyone bring up free float like that matters lmao? If NOK hits $10 the amount of outstanding shares will not matter. Stop fear mongering and stomping on shit before it begins. Nokia is the future I can’t post comments cause my account isn’t thirty days old. And you keep yapping your jaw like you know something. My calls are up and you’re broke and mad. Bozo All you’re doing is regurgitating garbage takes. Learn to this for yourself. NOK is getting infrastructure contracts from all over the world and has a contract to put the first cellular network on the more. Next warning report it’s going to Mars. No one gives a shot about your fundamentals, boomer. Go buy stock in Apple *think *moon Earnings* Yeah my grammar is fucked but whatever. Imagine calling someone a pussy cause they dmed you. Like I said I’m not allowed to post comments cause this is a new account, and even if I was I wouldn’t wanna expose you as the retard you are for shouting nonsense into the void. Dickhead. Look at your comment history. Salty as fuck. “Let’s do spy put lottos but fuck the company that is mooning 8% in the last month. Truly autistic and most likely in the red. Neck yourself Remember when the Steelers were 11-0? 💀💀💀"  /u/cantstandithere  Mods need to do some serious clean up around here.

Wtf E*TRADE I bought a shit load of 1/22 amc calls and shit skyrockets today and I’m up like 1000 percent and I sell (with a market order which is why I’m probably fucked and they ain’t gonna fix it) fucking bid and ask has plenty of orders and was at like .25 per contract on the 3.50 calls and E*TRADE fucking executed at .01 per contract and I lose all my money like wtf. I literally just made a fucking pro trade only to get fucked in the ass by a market order. These motherfuckers on the phone say they have to do a trade inquiry but since it was a market order it’s probably my fault. Fucking fuck fuck fuck. Bullshit. Literally the difference between thousands and zero. I’m so fucking pissed. I’ve never had this issue with market orders before these mtberfuckers better credit my account with this trade inquiry, or else I’m bigly fucked. Normally I’d be ok with losing when I make a stupid ass play. But not like this wtf.|2021-01-22 13:29:14

k80w7k|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|4|My attempt to not only shit post today...  Market is down despite better than expected market purchase manager surveys and existing home sales report. Increased concerns over covid infections and poor vaccine distribution has created negative market sentiment. UK may be on lock down til summer, Hong Kong just issued lock down.  Bond prices are slightly up from yesterday.  Reports:  Vaccine distribution: only 800k a day, we were expecting twice that. States are starting to throw away vaccines.  Existing home sales: December report showed 6.76 million homes sold, higher than the expected amount of 6.55. Better than November report as well.  Janet Yellen: received unanimous approval. High hopes.  Markit pmi reports: released survey of purchasing managers. This report came out at 58.0 for January, higher than 55.3 in December. Both manufactoring and servicing sectors showed increased purchase manager activity. A key footnote in here is supply chains bottlenecks have been reported, this could drive up inflation.  Next week reports: Tuesday's consumer confidence index for January, market is predicting 89.1.

k6s6qd|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|3|Here’s some loose ideas to look at when trying to trade. These are not laws and are merely patterns that I’ve seen while staring at graphs all day. If it starts the day in the red and there really isn’t news it’ll most likely go up hit a peak and come back down. If it starts green good chance it’s going to plummet a little and make it back,  buy the dip. 11-12 brings sell offs due to the guys who own all the stock taking lunch. Fridays most smart guys know to take their profits so usually a dip, buy some puts sell with meager if any profit and roll that into something else you like.  Don’t be afraid to sell sometimes liquidity is key.|2021-01-22 09:24:53

It settled down for a bit after that but it looks like that was a sign of things to come.  What happened to all the contrarian gangs, like tanker gang, clang gang, fucking cob mob? Where are the weirdos playing with leveraged ETFs? Heck, who’s even buying SPY calls anymore? Where are all the wild Pepe Silvia-style macro DDs, like Variation-Separate, TQQQ Burry, “Once more into the marketpocalypse breach”?

k7tgwx|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|3|NOK sucks and is a terrible investment.  A lot of the 5g stuff was priced in ages ago and a bunch of other companies are doing it way better. The biggest contracts were given already. 100 contracts last year sounds good on paper but you gotta look into those contracts. Would you rather have the one 5g contract from Verizon in the US that Samsung got (6.65 billion dollars) or ten Scandinavian fishing village contracts?  Nok missed on earnings estimates the last 3 quarters. In fact, their last earnings was basically unforgivable where they decided not to pay their dividends for the quarter.  Nok has a p/e ratio of 26 so its not really super "undervalued"  Might actually be overvalued.  Has a massive float and a ton of shares outstanding. Nothing will pump this shit.  Look at the 1 year chart. Look at the 5 year chart. The stock has stayed nearly the same in 5 years.  Imagine putting money in a go nowhere stock when literally everything else is mooning?  You look at the people shilling nok, its all they post. The same few people trying to make this a thing wuth misleading DD and crazy speculation that makes stockrwit users look reasonable.

k7c17l|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|0|I know I’m going to get downvoted but I don’t see the play gme can make. I’ve seen some people say they could get acquired but why wouldn’t Microsoft acquire them(if that was their intentions) when they first made the deal with them in October when they were trading at $13 share. Gme can’t really compete with Microsoft or PlayStation for the online marketplace as it is so much easier buying games directly from the respective consoles marketplace. If they solely build computers(switch to a computer store) they are still in the dying retailer space. Other than the short squeeze from hopefully happening I don’t see too many opportunities for GameStop. Let’s see if Ryan Cohen just got lucky with chewy or if he actually knows what he’s doing and if he can turn GameStop around. Obligatory fuck Melvin and fuck Andy left I’d rather be wrong than them being right|2021-01-22 11:03:43

It is stacked against the average joe with many industries only existing to provide huge profits to a few at the top.

k75y1u|l2lfqs|l2lfqs|1|Posting here so I might maybe get a real answer vs the GME thread.  I have Feb 19 $60 GME calls, will likely be up 100% or more by EOD. Would it be smartest for me to sell these before close and rebuy next week? I don't usually buy options on this time scale, I'm typically either years or weekly earnings plays.   Smart brain says that weekend news could bring price down and if I sell today I can lock in gains, then re-evaluate Monday morning and rebuy or whatever. Comes with risk of positive GME news coming out and it gapping up over weekend, but I'd at least lock in profits.  Retard brain is just full of rocket emojis so I dunno which to trust.|2021-01-22 10:33:27

Resigning the pact with Russia yesterday is the reason why I think it shot up, and also better news about vaccine.
