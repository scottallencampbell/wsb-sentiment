h29wmm|w4cr1m|w4cr1m|6|Tech has been so much stronger than rest of the market the past couple of weeks:  QQQ is back to mid-June levels (before the panic collapse around the 0.75 rate hike in June), while SPY is still down 20 points (around 5%) from those levels.  SPY still has to fill its gap back to 401, while QQQ already filled its gaps.  Hard to bet against an uptrend like this where tech is driving the bus; this is the first bear market rally that feels like a real bullish trend because tech is leading the way.  Basically, stay away from puts until tech rolls over.  Bullish trend is in control as long as tech leads.|2022-07-21 10:38:34

h2btad|w4cr1m|w4cr1m|7|Tesla needs to announce a small car to compete with the VW ID series and all the BYD, Nio, and XPEV competitors in China. The most disappointing thing about Tesla is their failure to do this so far. There is massive demand a <$35k vehicle across all their markets, especially Europe and china. I think part of the problem is Elon wants to stuff $5000 worth of autopilot hardware into every vehicle no matter what what the market|2022-07-21 10:50:28

The coincident economic index which rose in June suggests the economy grew through the second quarter. However, the forward-looking LEI points to a US economic downturn ahead.”|2022-07-21 09:06:10

h27jln|w4cr1m|w4cr1m|7|AMZN is getting One Medical for less than their IPO opening day price; I like this deal the more I look at it.  If they can figure out how to bundle healthcare (pharmacy through pillpack, primary care through One Medical), it could really shake up the space.  Maybe they take over Crossover Health next (startup they've invested in before for primary care) which is probably worth around $1-2 billion or so as another tech-style primarcy care company.  If Jassy can figure out how to make AMZN a real force in healthcare, that could become a major 3rd silo alongside AWS and the retail business.|2022-07-21 10:23:46

The enlightenment came about only because people were so sick of stabbing each other in the streets that they decided to just focus on science and money and not the meaning to life.

h22b1e|w4cr1m|w4cr1m|2|Biden has covid and is in the high risk group but has had 50 doses of the vaccine and good medical care. Market seems unconcerned and Trump pulled through even before there was a vaccine. That said, Trump said he had mild symptoms then had to go to the hospital and he was younger and generally more vibrant than Biden.  My question is how does this impact his ability to deal with the myriad crises that come up in a given week? Shouldn't this be a strong bear signal to the extent we need someone to fist bump MBS or castigate Putin for oil production increases? Isn't it assumed he pressures Powell to take it easy on the rate hikes?  All of this feels like it should shift expectations slightly but seems to have 0 impact. Obviously, Biden dying would be a major event and would ripple through the economic outlook. Any increase in the odds of that happening should need to be priced in. Right?|2022-07-21 09:50:03

I guess it's diamond hands hoping the price turns around, but the trend has been down all year so it's not clear why there isn't more booking of profits. Volume was way up the past few days so a lot of buyers bought near the top, but booking even a 5% return on the week with the risk that BTC ducks back to 20k seems like the safer, smarter bet.|2022-07-21 09:23:24
