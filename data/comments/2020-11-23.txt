If everything drops 50%, so will these boomer stocks. The thing is they are less volatile so the premium is cheap. Instead of spy puts which are pricey as fuck, buy boomer puts for same exposure.|2020-11-23 11:32:42

dc8rsz|jzfrez|jzfrez|9|The most important thing to keep in mind right now is that everything is trading on momentum.  Every move is being driven as far and as parabolic as possible.  Right now, technical analysis (which we all know is just a bunch of doodles) is actually more predictive than fundamental analysis.  We all know that these "hot" stocks are way overvalued, but they're all trading on momentum.  Just follow the momentum and try to sell before it all falls apart.  This is literally 1999 all over again if you look at EV stocks/battery co's/clean energy/etc.  Some of them will survive, but most are never going to justify these valuations.  But that won't stop them all from going higher in the short term.|2020-11-23 09:52:31

They have the Lidar which is dope, but expensive and not really scalable.  Li Auto is not even a pure EV, it has a tiny battery that is recharged by a small turbo ICE engine -- they won't have a pure EV in 2022, that's a long time in EV years. I bought into Xpeng as who doesn't like free $$, but I think NIO is where it is at.|2020-11-23 09:53:11

dcy563|jzfrez|jzfrez|-7|Hello All,  I just wanted to say with a heavy heart, that I have outgrown WSB. Its not the community's fault, but rather me realizing my true potential as a trader and increasingly seeing that I have more in common with the successful greats that I read books about. There comes a time in everyone's life where they grow and must leave behind the things that once amused them. With that, its hard to give up a community that has provided me so much over the years, but its time to spread my wings and fly.   Sincerly, A Successful Trader  edit; copy pasta from discord 😭|2020-11-23 13:17:32
