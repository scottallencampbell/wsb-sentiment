r17x3x|xvaz09|xvaz09|7|Guys, hate to be the bearer of DD, but the BoE has a different mandate from the Fed and the British economy is in a different state with different obligations and risks right now. Fed has a dual mandate of employment and inflation. BoE has the mandate of saving their flailing economy.  The real drop in value of the pound was a result of people seeing Charles' face on it and wanting nothing to do with that. When they found out those coins still could by a pint, everything went back to business as usual. We use real money in the US and don't care which face is on the bills as long as they still work as straws for our coke habits. Very different. We've seen the UK per capita GDP drop as we remind the world our dicks are the biggest and our economy is strongest and even our 40 year old weapons can melt faces. The brits use funny accents to disguise their dementia (I'd use a different word and an Arrested Development reference but the mod will delete my comment if I do).   Powell isn't going to pivot because he can 1) improve the health of the economy by driving us into a recession and 2) improve the global economy by hurting the rest of the world more. We don't manufacture stuff so the strong dollar means it's cheaper to import. We ring-fenced China so manufacturing has moved to little China (Vietnam), "real China" (Taiwan), Latin China (Mexico), and "I Can't Believe it's not China" (everywhere else shit is produced).  Market is going to take a nice healthy dump to 3000-3200 and then the end of the recession will be priced in. Within 5 years, S&P 500 will not be a meme and the dollar will be worth all the money. We've seen this before.   &#x200B;  So sell your shit, quit your jobs and claim unemployment and make JPow's job easier so he can turn the money printer back on in late 2023/early 2024 and we can take another decade long victory lap.   If not for you, do it for my portfolio and the portfolio of all the children I'll have when I knock up your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend and her starving European cousins.  It's just basic logic and the right thing to do.|2022-10-04 11:23:49

It's much easier to try to dismiss the UN, much harder to discount market supply/demand patterns.   Note that this reasoning doesn't negate the likelihood it's a short term Bear market rally (depends a lot on bond buying and inflation's arc, really, and I wouldn't take that home as a bull case right now) but I think for people it's easy to avoid the cognitive dissonance and blame this on the UN rather than face the uncertainty of market patterns.|2022-10-04 10:39:48

r14o6p|xvaz09|xvaz09|4|Now that I have sold and sitting on the sideline, let me offer my opinion on why we rallied:   a.   To begin with, we were already in oversold territory.   b.   We touched 200 WMA, a key support level.  Market was already exhausted and could not push further, this usually creates a bounce.   c.   Most importantly - all the negative news (UK pension almost defaulted, Credit Suisse, etc) and the fact that BOE did a 180 and started QE led to market believing the Fed will pivot.  Now, most of you do not agree BUT that is what the bond folks believe.  So they started moving the 2023 terminal rate lower and sooner, resulting in the yields dropping big time.   All of the above came together in a perfect storm and BOOM .... market ripped despite Vix being still high at 29/30.|2022-10-04 11:03:07

r1d01n|xvaz09|xvaz09|2|At 10:30 am I bought 50 12/18 $TWTR $55C‚Äôs for .08c each. I went into this thinking it was a complete LOTTO call considering Elon was rumored on buying for $54.20.  However, I was okay losing $400 which is the worst case scenario. However there is always some fuckery going on with Elon and I think there‚Äôs a slim chance that he changes his mind and decides to go public with the company or makes some questionable tweets that hint about doing so that makes the stock price rise.  So best case scenario, I have 50 ATM calls for 2 months out with insane IV that will probably be up 10-50x immediately.  Middle scenario is that a dumber degenerate on here pays me .08c or more per call even though they‚Äôre essentially worthless and I break even or make a few bucks.|2022-10-04 11:55:47

The market is rising because they think their is no way the fed will bring the pain and crash the market. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ first off the 1% don't care if you suffer only if they stay rich if it goes up or down doesn't matter when you have so much you never have to cash out. Second the fed doesn't care if raise rates cause it to be harder for a person in a third world country. And  guess what gas is going up it's jumped .40 cents in the last two weeks. In 2008  I always felt like it was self inflicted because they new that raising rated would cause defaults but now I understand why they did it.   Doesn't matter how hard you buy the dip the fed will do its job. So I say buy it all up back to 36k this week ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ|2022-10-04 05:45:35

r1r0yk|xvaz09|xvaz09|0|Can anyone explain what has improved for BTC since May? looked like we were heading to a healthy 12k bottom and it pivoted from 18k to 24k for two months and is now holding 20k like a baby monkey. I ask because I'm short a lot of things that are correlated to it and scratching my head at who is buying. Gold I get. If we lose the fight against inflation etc. But BTC is a risk asset rather than store of value and risk should be getting killed by higher rates, reduced savings etc.|2022-10-04 13:24:14
