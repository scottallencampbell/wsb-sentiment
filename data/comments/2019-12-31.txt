As stated before there is a heavy short interest in ACB specifically and in the cannabis sector in general. That is now squeezing as tax loss harvesting season ends and portfolios can re-enter cannabis and re-balance their risk to include cannabis in 2020  If we break 2.14 today next stop is 2.32 within the week.

That strong rebound after retesting support, coupled with the technical oscillators showing bullish divergence compared to price movement over the past months tells me a bottom is in on the ETF / sector at least (not speaking to individual names).
