gpgq4x|ezqu6w|ezqu6w|4|So for all your RH poors just keep on scrolling because you all don’t have this feature available to you.   On TSLA using think or swim I realized stop losses on options can be your best friend. Everyone knows how quickly it moves when it moves in your direction. Every $500 gain, set a $300 stop loss below what you’re currently at. If you get to $1000, set it for $700. $1500 set it for $1200. Etc. That way if Tesla moves very quickly against you, you have a new order in place to let you still get out for a nice portion without completely getting your ass handed to you.|2020-02-06 09:54:22

gq5h5r|ezqu6w|ezqu6w|13|I haven't seen a single post about a correction in here lately.  The euphoria just keeps growing. New "traders" keep pouring in. You have twinks buying options who have no idea what they're even buying and doubling their money.  You could have bought calls on pretty much anything on in the past few weeks/months/year and made 10x. You have well established, non boundary pushing companies up 100% YoY.  Fear & Greed index was at Extreme Greed last month. Now it's at greed. How much you wanna bet that next month it's at fear? Big banks/funds have their finger on the trigger ready to take profits. They know we are overdue for a correction..  By all means, get your daily plays in newbies. Just know that one of these days you're going to learn a lesson about the market and this idea in your head that you're going to double your money 6 times and become a millionaire is going to come crashing down as you realize that you might win big once or twice, but you arent going to win big in the long run. And you're in it for the long run, because everyone is after one big win. This is a dopamine release game. Some of you retards haven't been around long enough to remember the last big correction where people were getting margin called left and right, and literally people were on here saying they were financially fucked and wouldnt be able to make their car payments, rent, etc. That was real. So again, by all means get your plays in, but dont fucking use margin, dont use money you cant afford to lose tomorrow, and dont be buying $1500 LEAPS on TSLA thinking it's easy money, because chances are we are heading for a big correction within the next 2 months, and then another one if Trump loses the election in November.|2020-02-06 13:43:49

gp8fhm|ezqu6w|ezqu6w|2|I have a question about selling calls that I can't seem to answer via google. I understand the basics of buying options - essentially a contract to buy at the strike price, for an initial premium price - but how does selling a call option that you've bought work? All the resources I'm finding come from the perspective of being the call writer. But selling your contract doesn't make you the writer, thus obligated to sell those shares, correct? Does the premium at the new price then go to you?   You autists are making me consider options and I just want to know as much as I can before riding that train|2020-02-06 08:29:54

gpveae|ezqu6w|ezqu6w|2|welp dumped all my BA leaps about 5 mins ago. went in with 37k, out for about 49k for a net of 12k gain.  * 380c at avg of $16 (oof) x20, sold at avg of $21+. ~10k gain * 390c at avg of $12 (oof) x4, sold at avg of $17. ~2k here  the oof is cuz 380c went as low as like $8 to $9 (had to avg down) and the 390c went as low as $7 (ditto here).  still have a wacky march spread going on that's currently red cuz i sold spread yesterday and didn't close this moring as i was busy scalping TSLA. oops.   those sold calls are like -200% right now. i'm just gonna ride these 360/380c out cuz it might actually pan out.|2020-02-06 12:12:31
