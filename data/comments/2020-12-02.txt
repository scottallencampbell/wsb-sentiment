Any attempt to pull the rug is just ignored.  &#x200B;  *The year was 2060 and SPY had its first red day in 40 years. The crash of 2060 where SPY declined by 0.02% was something most investors had never seen before. Many had only heard of days where declines could exceed half a percent and in some cases, even an entire one percent or more move could take place. These were generally held as fables but now there is proof. The next 40000 point rally began the next day.*  *-Yolo Investors Daily, 2061*|2020-12-02 11:03:38

edts0h|k57d6a|k57d6a|7|NIO was pulling back for a breather and then got caught with bad Kandi news amongst others yesterday bringing it down further.   However, NIO has an new model launch day first week of Jan, it is smashing it's numbers, it is looking to expand manufacturing asap, it is supported as the Chinese Tesla by the CCP, there is a huge growing Chinese EV market incentivised by the government. They are looking to go global. So they are a great short-term and long-term bet.  Hence the strong buying today on that pullback. NIO should be part of the Santa rally up to Jan launch day, imo.|2020-12-02 10:26:26

Use it as a proxy for demand of a specific option; you should care much more about how current IV stands relative to historical IV, not just the raw number.  Going by the posts in this forum, 95% of you retards seem to think a group of fucking boomers in a JPM penthouse manually sets the IV every morning to affect the price of your calls.|2020-12-02 10:22:08

But no news on it, either because hedge funds are saving the pump for after the lockout agreement, or, PLTR has a stigmatizing reputation and so companies silence news about their collaboration.

eduqjo|k57d6a|k57d6a|3|It's not a flashy stock and I have no idea what the options market looks like, but NortonLifeLock (NLOK) has some interesting price action going on recently. Mature, cyber security software company that pays \~2.75% and has beat estimates for at least 5 straight quarters but has been beaten down since 2017?  It has been trading essentially dead flat for like two weeks on almost 8M shares per day...weird. Low short interest, big institutional ownership...  I bought a couple lots at $18.07 the other day. I think a run into the mid-19s/low-20s is imminent at least. That's my exit point for now.|2020-12-02 10:32:50

Keeping the shares for long term hold.   Start looking into companies that will benefit from the 10 Dec COVID vaccine emergency approval.  PFE was at $37 just 3 days ago.  The calls were fairly cheap and the IV was reasonable at 35% ish.  I am up 130% on it already.  My next play might be airline stocks...|2020-12-02 10:49:47

Every night I wake up about 5 hours before open, drink a bunch of coffee and read WSB.

I do NOT sell or buy anything during the day, just enjoy the ride.|2020-12-02 07:16:23

Edit: For context in this, Zenimax had a *highly* profitable MMO in ESO Online, and despite Reddit hating the game I’m pretty certain Fallout 76 was extremely profitable. Then factor in the insane Big Name IPs that come with the acquisition.   All I’m saying is have perspective and don’t let someone tell you the lego bricks they’re trying to sell you are actually solid gold, if the valuation gets too out of hand.|2020-12-02 09:55:11

I also got filled on my 25's that I forgot to cancel.  I am twice as exposed to GME as I intended to be.  I guess I'm in it for the long haul.|2020-12-02 12:00:24

edqsz4|k57d6a|k57d6a|19| Dear Palantir, you still ain't called or turned green in awhile,   I hope you have a chance I ain't mad, I just think it's messed up you don't print money for fans   If you didn't wanna talk to me after the market closed You didn't have to, but you coulda at least opened a little higher today for my WSB bros   They are like my family, man, some of them think like they are only six years old   We waited to hear about you on Jim Cramer and all the late night financial shows last night   For four hours and they just said, "No."   That's pretty messed up PLTR, you're like our idol   We post more meme’s about you than NIO; we don’t know what you do, but we wish every company was just like you  I’m actually not all that mad though, I just don’t like bein' lied to Remember when I first bought you under $18, you said if I held on we’d go to the moon and never come back          See I'm just like you in a way I don’t really know what I’m doing in the market either   I buy some stocks that go up, and when I get angry I pull out my below-average dong and beat er'   I can relate to what Citron is saying in their Tweets So when I have a bad day, I drift away and put my turbo engines on '  Cause I don't really got shit else so think about going to the MOON when I’m depressed   I even got a tattoo of your stock symbol across the chest   Sometimes I even sell my stock in the red just to see how much I lose   Its like adrenaline man, the pain is such a sudden rush for me   See everything you do is so dumb, and I respect you, because you do it   Literally nobody is jealous of me and they are sick of me because I post about you 24/7  But they don’t know you PLTR like I know you, nobody does   Nobody knows what it feels like to lose so much money when you are up   Listen, please hit my calls already   I’ll be the biggest fan you ever lose   Sincerely yours, this is TIM   P.S. We should consider a stock split too   Sent - 11:03 AM|2020-12-02 10:05:43

IBD says: "The bill, which already cleared the Senate in May, could kick Chinese companies off U.S. exchanges within three years". THREE years. But only if the Treasury doesn't come up with a workaround for auditing the accounts. There are ways to implement this which means stock listings are not affected and don't need to delist at all.   So NIO, XPEV etc trading can continue for at least a few months or years until that approach becomes clearer.|2020-12-02 12:16:36

ed8fs2|k57d6a|k57d6a|5|I love this sub most days but holy fuck some of you are so retarded, like a bunch of sheep repeating each other for validation. People are saying its game over for PLTR you can't sustain that kind of growth, are the same ones who were LAUGHING at people for purchasing NIO for $13.  Then after months of calling NIO people retards, they bitched about missing the run up and were hoping for 100% gains after buying in at $40.    &#x200B;  PLTR isn't going to 30 this week, 40 by end of year. But this company is going to be huge. It has positioned itself in the market very securely and to be quite honest, doesn't even have any competition at what they do and how well they do it yet. This will pay massively possibly within 6-12 months time. Definitely 2+ years.|2020-12-02 07:50:22

eejnrp|k57d6a|k57d6a|4|Q: Is PLTR going to explode in the coming years, if not months?  &#x200B;  Absolutely. If the company didn't grow a single quarter for the next 3 years, it would still be worth 19-22$. Except it is growing. And its securing government guaranteed money, and will likely beat expected earnings a ton. There is no reason a stock should go from $2-50 like NIO in a matter of months, that is unsustainable, sketchy auditings at best, and cooked books.  However, American companies that are audited as TSLA has proven, can still trade for many times that current earnings level. Based on future expected profitability.  And I think PLTR, given its behemoth status in Data, is about as safe as it gets in long term investments. And further, it has lots of room to grow and mature, where the same can't be said about all the typical blue chip companies like Microsoft or Facebook, where the bulk of their exponential growth has already passed.  &#x200B;  Don't be discouraged that a stock that rose over 20% in 10 days... a month after its IPO, has fallen 20% to levels not seen since... last wednesday.  20 is the floor. 100 is the year out ceiling IMO. I think actually 50 is much more likely\* but I no longer underestimate the power of autistic trading influence in the markets.  &#x200B;  TLDR: yeah|2020-12-02 13:20:16

Bought CRSR at the top yesterday and sitting on a $1.2k loss. NIO stop loss triggered at $39 this morning, and again, it climbed up to break even and more ($1k+ loss).  The rest of losses came from NIO taking a beating, JMIA getting whipped and a few others tanking.  This is the worst trading week and I'm playing with shares.

TSLA sentiment here in general should have been inversed this time around.   We are racing to a cliff blindfolded right now. Respect to those with the madness, bankroll and balls to navigate this until the incoming correction.   But we may have a chance to buy at the bottom again after December. Good luck!

I bought NIO yesterday afternoon.  Auto sell triggered at opening.  I'm missing the f'ing climb.  I guess the 10% drop auto sell doesn't apply to meme stonks?  Live and learn.  Only lost about $40.  Same shit with PLTR.  At least BB and CCL are okay today.  Just buying shares for now.|2020-12-02 09:25:27

You still have a few days to sign up for secret Santa. Who knows maybe you and your wife will match and she'll gift you one of those blowjob things you always hear her giving her boyfriend.   Maybe this could be your chance to get matched with some new "girl" and you guys can move in together until your wife and boyfriend leave your house.   If you're crying over your losses on PLTR the past two days this could be your chance to be gifted something valuable you can sell just to lose all that money all over again.   Either way look at this for those of you that got gainz you're charity for some poor person who doesn't know they should've invested because stonks I mean stocks always go up and make their Christmas awesome. For those of you that posted loss porn this is your last and final YOLO before letting your wife's boyfriend put you on onlyfans   If you're too busy counting gainz or crying while listening to your wife fuck her boyfriend to Google it the link is below  [link for lazy people](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/#/select/my-current/)  I hope I get matched with one of you crazy bastards 😜|2020-12-03 11:44:21

No wonder we're seeing a pop off.  >**Citi Group - Walt Disney Co (DIS)** Buy   >   >**Updating Model; Raising Target Price to $175**   >   >01 Dec 2020 23:00:00 ET   >   >**Updating Model**   We are updating our Disney model to reflect F4Q20 results as well as updated views on the firm’s operating outlook. In broad terms, we continue to expect a measured recovery within Disney’s core businesses (Parks, Studio, and Media Networks). At the same time, given the continued momentum of Disney’s streaming apps, we are raising our outlook for the firm’s DTC segment.   >   >**Raising Target Price**   In conjunction with our model update, we are rolling forward our valuation framework from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023. As a result, our target price increases from $150 to $175 per share. And, at our new target price, our Disney equity value tilts a bit more toward the firm’s DTC business. DTC now represents 44% of our target price (up from 41% previously).   >   >**Maintaining View**   Following our update, we maintain our Buy rating on Disney. While the firm continues to endure near-term operating headwinds as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the market is increasingly focused on the prospects for Disney’s operations to gradually return to normal. In addition, we’d expect investors to continue to embrace the firm’s direct-to-consumer pivot. Indeed, we expect the Investor Day – slated for December 10th – to give management an opportunity to share its more ambitious tilt toward the DTC opportunity.|2020-12-02 11:01:22
