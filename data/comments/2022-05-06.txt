7jqrd2|ujjzf7|ujjzf7|16|Jobs numbers basically came in line.  they hit a sort of sweet spot.  around 400k was expected, they just added a little bit more over that...so in line.  If numbers came in too low, it would have been a worrying sign that stagflation were setting in.  If too many jobs came in, it would have been bad because the labor market is still too hot.  Earnings/compensation basically stayed the same, so there may be a little bit of relief that costs for labor haven't gone up, which is significantly adding to inflation.  Might get some relief here for a green day or stay relatively flat.    Waiting to see if consumer credit usage for March comes out.  If that keeps going up like it has been, look out.  It means consumers do not have anywhere near as much cash in savings as is believed. More revolving credit usage means less and less of a buffer during a downturn.|2022-05-06 07:48:04

7l6xz2|ujjzf7|ujjzf7|7|6 years ago, had I just made and stuck to a rule to sell any short term options play once they got anywhere from +20% to +50% I would actually be very proud of my account right now lol.  Instead, I get that limp dick shame a few times a week thinking about how much I left on the table and the college student financial state that I've bought for myself. Today is a fantastic example... AMD calls.. +180%... Guess who didn't sell? This fucking guy. It's actually pretty amazing how many of my plays got to that range looking back.   Lesson learned? Lmaoooo.

7l4w2v|ujjzf7|ujjzf7|4|ARKK flows are probably the best gauge of whether/when we see capitulation.  Biggest inflows in over a year over the past week.  Feels like early 2002 right now where hordes of investors were buying the 60-70% dips on tech names as a "once in a generation" buying opportunity (at 1998 prices).  Those stocks all went down another 60-70% over the following year and were off 90+% at the bottom as those dip buyers took losses.  If we see a replay of that in a Fed hard landing, then you will see massive outflows in ARKK at $20 as it moves to the bottom.|2022-05-06 13:42:23

No reallocation. No diversification. Whole portfolio was Peloton and memes. He'd genuinely be better off living under a guardianship.  Don't be that guy. Don't fall for the diamond hands trap. If you're down literally HALF maybe try some critical thinking.|2022-05-06 07:46:42

7jv3aj|ujjzf7|ujjzf7|3|Okay, for those of you that like to inverse me and actually make money.  I'm expecting a dip at open aiming for 405.  Climbing the rest of the day slowly as people say nice reassuring things all day.  Max Pain is 428.  Thinking it'll make it to 425.  +0.5% EOD.    TSLA will probably spike on Shanghai news.  MSFT and AAPL and Adobe will probably get punched right in the subscription model.  Those are going to tank, but probably settle back out cause they aren't dumb enough to lose money for long.  They'll adjust.    My AMD calls for May 20 are probably uber fucked.  RIP 125C, as long as I haven't sold you, they aren't real losses yet.

Your therapist, and your sponsor, and common sense told her it was the easiest way to protect you. Abstinence is the key. It's easier to not have to make the right decision than it is to be faced with it and choose to do the right thing.  But you haven't lost everything yet. She only thinks you have.  The last $5k you had holed away is on SPY calls expiring today. The premarket recovery to flat has you exultant. Or maybe the bottle of Barefoot you bought at 7-Eleven this morning has you exultant. You had to take the cash and coins out of your daughter's piggy bank so you could buy the bottle without your wife noticing.

They include:    >	Alleged overt sexual language directed at both players and staffers, including telling one player — who had a previously known mental-health diagnosis — that the player wasn’t depressed, she just “needs some dick.” Later, Cooper-Dyke called the player a “sorry-ass virgin.”  >	There were also multiple alleged instances of calling players “retarded,” including this anecdote:  >	“In one instance, according to three players, Cooper-Dyke beat her chest and changed her voice to mimic a person with special needs and screamed, 'Look at these fucking retards I’m coaching.'"|2022-05-06 07:26:47

7knbqs|ujjzf7|ujjzf7|1|[+$94k today for a total of +$313k unrealized mostly from SPX CCS and FB CCS. Still holding the full line, internal $TICK readings still displaying underlying selling pressure.](https://i.imgur.com/956sa2h.png) Main position is 5/20 SPX 4250/4275 CCS which is pretty far OTM now, 5/20 FB 210/220 CCS, and 6/17 FB 200/180 DPS. [Here was the FB trade setup with three lines indicating stop loss, entry, and target for roughly 1:5 R/R.](https://i.imgur.com/1R954Ci.png) Anticipating FB to break its daily 21 EMA and gap fill to roughly ~$190. Scaling out and will probably dump the remaining MSFT and QQQ put position by EoD. In terms of market structure, price action is still objectively bearish with SPX and QQQ at -2 ATR. However there's pretty strong support at SPX monthly 21 EMA which is at ~4110, we tested it twice this week and it held both times. Still looking for a capitulation candle, I don't see current levels as the temporary bottom yet. Feeling comfortable with CCS but would be nervous with straight puts since the explosive move happened yesterday. Planning to just milk premium decay with a slow bleed down with SPX targets at 4110, 4070, and 4025. As always, will scale out as targets hit|2022-05-06 11:37:43

He can seldom close his eyes without opening them again at fear of cramer lurking in the jungle trees. Not that you could ever see the bastards, mind you. They were swift, and they knew their way around the jungle like nothing else. He remembers the looks on the boys' faces as he walked into that village and... oh, Jesus. The memories seldom left him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce - even hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes like nothing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with him. The boys are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes. And, every now and then, the way that seven looks at him with avid concern in his eyes... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. Makes him feel like he's back there... in the jungle.|2022-05-06 08:24:26

So when the market is dying people will get into it. When the market looks greener they will leave, to make 7%+ somewhere else. That's what it's going to do until it's off the market or the deal collapses. A limit down day or two could very well put the deal in jeopardy.|2022-05-06 07:33:21

7ktrmx|ujjzf7|ujjzf7|-4|I am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.  In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access the his trust fund we need your assistance.  Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.  Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.|2022-05-06 12:21:44

Idk but if I were a god, I certainly would appreciate those that are humble enough to ask for help and kneel in prayer daily.  No wonder so many of you are feeling helpless and depressed. It is refreshing as a human to give thanks for life and understand that we likely will never have all the answers in our lifetime. That’s where faith and humbleness comes in.|2022-05-06 13:15:32
