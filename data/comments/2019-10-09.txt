It‚Äôs really clever actually‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt think it will work in reality. The Midwest is too patriotic, to red, and the narrative that ‚Äúhe rejected a crop buy offer!‚Äù to easily countered by Trump during his campaign. All he has to say is that he is not abandoning our Midwestern brothers, because the Chinese are leaving state subsidies off the table.

33izc6|dffg89|dffg89|5|honestly trading spy now is like playing a lotto. Better to stay on the sidelines and watch for the good entry point. rn all depends on what kind of information we are eating, if trump says some shit the market tumble if deals goes partially well on some shit then market runs up. And there is a possibility to get a partial deal because that would promote market stability and at the same time its not dictating that the trade war is over yet. Plus giving the fact that China is such a lube boy, they could agree to some so so terms, they also care about their economy and stock market. Everyone pretty much wants a breath, Trump needs it to focus on campaign but he still needs an engagement in the war so partial would be ok for both of them it does not make the war over but gives a relief to a new chapter of bullshit in couple of months after a Christmas rally and good earnings season|2019-10-09 11:44:36

That means tomorrow will be likely to ping-pong between 291 and 292 unless there's news.  We also still have not gap-filled fully, so there is the possibility of a divergent high at 293, which will get pulled back down quickly to the 291-292 range.

33zwen|dffg89|dffg89|12|Bill bishop is a big china guy and he thinks the blacklist was meant to stave off 'weak on china, you caved' claims if Trump signs a mini-deal. This is not an impossibility. I still think my narrative of no-deal and the rationale is strong...so I am holding. I am down 240k today, but will see it through. The lack of Chinese response to the blacklist couuuulllld be interpreted as a power move to force a decision on Trump re: ag purchases, putting pressure on him via his base in the Midwest. However, it could also be what Bishop says.   I am holding to the bitter end because I do not believe that Trump and his team will cave to such a shitty offer, but you all should know that Bishop shouldn't be lightly discredited. I have pasted his email blast today below:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  As expected there are leaks today claiming Liu He is coming to DC bearing gifts targeted at reaching an armistice-like deal that includes a standstill on new tariffs and more agricultural purchases. As I wrote Monday I think that idea also includes yet another framework (or understandings as it may be called) for negotiators to work towards a President Trump-General Secretary Xi meeting, this time at the APEC meeting in Chile November 16-17, and a broader deal.   The US State Department followed the Department of Commerce√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Xinjiang-related additions to its Entity List with new visa restrictions. Yesterday the State Department announced:  >Visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the detention or abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs, or other members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China. Family members of such persons may also be subject to these restrictions.  The visa restrictions may be more symbolic than substantive, and are a far weaker punishment than the long-rumored imposition of sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act. The timing of these two moves is likely not coincidental to the trade talks. Were they made to make Trump look tough on China just before he agrees to a smaller trade deal, to inoculate him from charges of caving on trade?|2019-10-09 14:13:07
32puem|dffg89|dffg89|8|Puts until the financial crisis and liquidity trap.  Global economy doesn't have enough end demand to escape recession. stall velocity is going to recessionary.  Data in the US will show this in 6months.  The channels receiving global macro signals to the US take 6 months.  This is not like 2016 where china produced a large global stimulus signal to the system and saved it from a recession.   China wants anyone but trump and is intentionally not helping the global economy. That's how I know this deal will be a status quo, more of the same, if not a full no deal.|2019-10-09 06:52:46

33wvic|dffg89|dffg89|4|Since this market isn't doing shit I'll do the early edition of **Magical Crayons TA.**  We broke projected weekly trading resistance and now are sitting at last week's resistances, that is ranges between 291.25-292.25. Failing a substantial breakout over those ranges, we will continue the bearish trend of the last few weeks. However the directionality do suggest there is a lot of hopium still in the markets, so as bears the amount of shit-talking should now be downgraded from f-bombs to s-popguns.  Because of the significant gap between Oct 7 and 8 trading, that gap could potentially be impulsively filled to 293. If it does so without clear catalysts, it will be important to watch and observe its staying power at those levels. If you're an active trader it may be fun to play, as a swing trader it may be asshole clenching, but until directionality and volume show a strong commitment, the bearish thesis of the market hasn't been proven wrong quite yet.  **tl;dr: stonks go up, stonks go down. it'll probably go down but if it breaks 292.25 before eod watch your short-dated options.**|2019-10-09 13:47:43

32q2v3|dffg89|dffg89|3|**Buy SPX puts** if rally sustains itself today.  Ag goods for tariff relief trade deal would not be accepted by the smartest It in history. Farmer base support still strong because of the extra welfare and also willing to accept more butt stuff because you know, they secretly gay (like the mods). Withdrawing tariffs would be reducing pressure on China and if genius in chief did that, how can It expect to reach a trade deal that contains economics and IP reform? It has to keep tariff pressure in place in order to get concessions from China and buying ag goods is not a concession. As such, come Friday, It will not agree to the Chinese proposals offered on Thursday and markets will be **RED.**  Risk is China offering more meaningful concessions that It may actually agree to an interim trade deal.  Obligatory; nothing wrong with liking butt stuff.|2019-10-09 06:56:56

33sfxw|dffg89|dffg89|1|re: 25 basis point cut     **Voting for this action:** Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, and Randal K. Quarles.  **Voting against this action:** James Bullard, Esther L. George, and Eric Rosengren.        "President Bullard dissented because he believed that lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this time would provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slow- ing economy subject to elevated downside risks. In ad- dition, a 50 basis point cut at this time would help pro- mote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation ex- pectations to target. President George dissented be- cause she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term. Recogniz- ing the risks to the outlook from the effects of trade pol- icy and weaker global activity, President George would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point  to a materially weaker outlook for the economy. Presi- dent Rosengren dissented because he judged that mon- etary policy was already accommodative. In his view, additional accommodation was not needed for an econ- omy in which labor markets are already tight and could pose risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets and encouraging households and firms to take on too much leverage."|2019-10-09 13:04:32
