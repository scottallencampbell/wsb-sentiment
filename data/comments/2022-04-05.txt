3hxrg1|twreh5|twreh5|9|> "I think we can all absolutely agree inflation is too high and bringing inflation down is of paramount importance," Brainard said at a conference at the Minneapolis Fed. The Fed will raise rates "methodically" and as soon as next month begin to quickly ramp up reductions to its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet to a "considerably" more rapid pace of runoff than the last time the Fed shrank its holdings, Brainard said.  > That balance sheet shrinkage, combined with a series of Fed rate hikes, "will contribute to monetary policy tightening over and above the expected increases in the policy rate reflected in market pricing and the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections," she said.

Now, the economy is growing so rapidly — and prices are rising so quickly — that the only way for the Fed to get control is to slam on the brakes and cause a recession.  https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/business/economy/recession-economy.html|2022-04-05 11:11:50

3ii2pz|twreh5|twreh5|5|Goldman: The S&P 500 fell by 5% in 1Q to end the quarter at 4530.     Components of the return included +478bps from positive EPS revisions, -973bps from a contraction in P/E multiple, & +35bps from dividends.     From a sector perspective, the index was dragged down by Info Tech (-244bps) & Comm Services (-121bps), while Energy (+104bps) & Utilities (+12bps) fared best.    Slower domestic & global growth paired with higher commodity prices should continue to pose a risk to earnings & margins.    Goldman expect the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4700, representing a +4% upside from current levels in best case scenario vs worst case scenario, S&P 500 will finish the year at 3600, representing a -21% tumble.    Goldman f/casts the 2s10s inversion will exacerbate throughout the year. Ultimately, Goldman concludes, that puts the odds of a US recession at a 38% probability within the next 24 months.|2022-04-05 12:15:06

"It has done so despite clearly weaker fundamentals (more hikes, higher inflation, and curve inversion) and the Fed leaning against equity market strength to hike faster. The worsening macro backdrop and market-unfriendly Fed make sustained U.S. equity gains unlikely. In practice, this means lower risk assets."*  &#x200B;  **CALLS ARE FREE MONEY**|2022-04-05 08:01:16

The EU buys more than 45% of its coal from Russia. And global coal markets are already extremely tight, with record prices|2022-04-05 11:46:05

3kqxbm|twreh5|twreh5|2|i think the weird dynamic of commodities not going up for the past month is tied to working capital shortages of trading firms doing delivery. But this means there will be massive shortages as the end point refiners/manufacturers can't get materials.  Global supply chains are so screwed its not even funny. Just buy everything you think you will need for the next 2-3 years. Personally I think getting as many <4% autoloans on cars as possible is a good idea. Just run up your credit card and start stockpiling 2x4s in your backyard. Hardware tools as well, Bushels of wheat. In fact just hoard everything.|2022-04-05 21:30:49
