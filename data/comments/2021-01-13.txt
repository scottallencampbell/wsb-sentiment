j5gxda|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|14|> While noting that shorts definitely were a part of the buying binge, Ihor Dusaniwsky — the head of predictive analytics at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners, which specializes in analyzing data on short selling — said he doesn’t agree that GameStop’s price surge was the result of a squeeze.  > “GME’s board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,” Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. “While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question – did long buying lead to short covering\squeeze or short covering\squeeze lead to long buying?”  > Dusaniwsky believes it’s the former.  > “We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,” the analyst said. “Long buyers are the primary force driving GME’s stock price up. “  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366|2021-01-13 14:34:27

They're all waiting for the dip that isn't coming and the first ones to crack are going to fuck the rest of them over. There's plenty who are already going to be margin called and forced to close, and there's others who are trying to diamond hands this and will be forced to close when it doesn't go down.

j5c8ul|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|9|Alright, someone tell me why people think GameStop is going past todays peak. average volume is 8.6 mil, today is 131m, last reported short interest was 71 mil. There is 40 million more in volume than what it would take to cover every single short. The highest large volume puts were at 24$ . Price peaked at 65ish million on volume, which would be about where the large shorts would have finished covering.   Yeah, I'm still GME gang, it's still solid on fundamentals, but the squeeze is almost undeniably done, no?|2021-01-13 13:59:20

McConnell has said he won't bring senate back into session BUT Schumer shortly afterward specifically requested for senate to come back to session. watching Washington post it seems that Schumer's intention is to deal with this when senate comes back to session Jan19 when senate reconvenes. If the democrats pursue senate trial ASAP then there's breathing room to enter cannabis positions before congress starts to talk about it. The second congress takes up either piece of cannabis legislation the FOMO investors are going to make it skyrocket.  What am I waiting for?   I want to see what Biden says during his upcoming speech ( I keep hearing he's going to talk in the next 24 hours) I expect him to not put his thumb on the scale. I think he'll stfu about it for the most part -  and I want to see what happens between Schumer and McConnell. If McConnell won't bring back senate we have time, if he does then it's 🚀🚀 time. As soon as the impeachment trial is over IMO we're going to move onto to other prioritized legislation and Schumer has been quoted about cannabis legislation "It will be prioritized". I strongly think that the second the legislation is brought up in congress that the tendie train has left the station.|2021-01-13 16:23:03

The contract value for this phase is $8.5M, with a potential contract value of approximately $250M over all 4 phases. Palantir was awarded a Phase 1 Project Agreement through an Other Transaction Agreement with Consortium Management Group on behalf of Consortium for Command, Control and Communications in Cyberspace. During the first phase of the effort, Palantir will collaborate with the Army to design and demonstrate the ground station prototype solution for the Army's TITAN program. The Palantir solution will leverage space, high altitude, aerial, terrestrial sensors and data sources for use in intelligence and military targeting operations. It will field a "turn key" solution for the Army that integrates data from a variety of sources including commercial and classified sources from space to ground sensors. The results of the first phase of this competitive contract will be used by the Army to inform awarding of future phases and eventual production of the ground station for the TITAN enterprise.|2021-01-13 06:08:04

j4582n|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|5|When merger was announced: “Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share they own". This means that logically APHA's price should be 0.8381 times TLRY's price. At the moment, TLRY is $13.8 and APHA is 9.56. This translates to a 0.6928 ratio.   People don't realise that this is a literal arbitrage opportunity if you buy now and hold until merger in the second quarter of the year. APHA's stockprice doesn't even matter anymore, if TLRY grows more compared to APHA then the free tendies only become greater at merger.|2021-01-13 08:31:20

It takes a week or two to fully squeeze and GME is worth 50$ a share on fundamentals alone. Let alone with Cohen and his buddies joining in to fuck up boomer management.  Hold. It will dip perhaps, but don't fucking sell!  Edit: I'm seeing some posts explaining it better than me, but the jist of it is the same: SQUEEZE HAS NOT HAPPENED YET.

j4dmdq|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|7|can someone who knows how posting works on this sub please post advice to all the GME call holders to \*\*exercise\*\*, not sell their calls?  selling your calls in the thinly traded strikes with small open interests will open the door for shorts who are looking for ways to cover to push around the dumb retail money like us. thinly traded strikes with small open interests are a low-liquidity, low price-disocvery market. you can only sell for what someone is willing to buy. when the big boys who have done this for decades come looking for any penny of value they can find to alleviate short losses, they are going to beat you in the game of chicken. exercise your calls, don't sell them - you are leaving money on the table, and worse yet, giving it to the shorts!  exercising your options will cost you a bit in fees, but you will recoup those fees through stock price gains when the shorts have no options to exercise themselves.  &#x200B;  edit - WAAAAHHHHH I DON'T HAVE CASH!! call your broker and open a margin loan. they'll be happy to loan you money to exercise deep in the money options. if you're strikes are on the fringe of the current trading price (ie not deep in the money) then maybe you have a different calculus. no matter what the situation is, hold the line against the shorts, they can't keep it up forever.|2021-01-13 09:41:25

Biden's infrastructure bill will include tax credits for people who upgrade their windows, doors, insulation, and ***APPLIANCES*** etc. to energy efficient materials. These savings will then be used to upgrade every aspect of your home. Did you watch his campaign rallies and Build Back Better plan for the economy? Plus 2000$ checks, Joe Manchin not a factor since it can be done via budget reconciliation and you just need Collins, Romney, or Murkowski. People are loading up for the ex-dividend date of 1/19/21. Get in for the run up and when DRIP kicks in people will buy more shares. Plus buybacks active from investor day! I keep posting this DD cause you guys are retarded and keep buying GME and Palantir, when Lowe’s just keeps rallying and rallying. You’d be up.|2021-01-13 11:41:49

By how much we’ve climbed today, it wasn’t even that big of a dip.  Still pretty autistic though because I YOLO’d on 20 $35c expiring Friday for an average cost of $3.29, so. maybe about to lose a lot of my worth.|2021-01-13 11:37:55

They are saying it's a matter of when not if it takes hold. Projecting possibly double infection rates within two weeks up to 20x in the near future at the current rates. My guess is we are doing a bit better than the US? Don't know what your government is telling you but if trends continue shit is gonna go full lock down. They just put 8pm curfew in one province and only leaving house for food and the Dr. in my province. Busting people left and right for violations. Shit is gonna get very bad for a few months.

Look at all the other currencies vs. USD.  Also the Fed cannot allow the bond market to inflate too high for our debt. Bonds will remain volatile but I think people will think twice about them ripping upwards.  Puts - IWM / Cyclicals|2021-01-13 11:19:23

There are plenty of data points to plot, including underlying quotes, greeks, IV, Volume, OI, etc.  Several people have brought up concern for the legality of what I'm doing with this site, because I'm getting the data from CBOE. Turns out, the concerns are 100% valid, I might actually be violating their user agreement BIGLY. However, because this is EOD data, the rules may be different (probably not, but I'm a glass half full kinda guy).  Anyway, I gave CBOE a call, and my case is being escalated to the legal team, lmao.  Hopefully the legal team takes so long to get back to me, all of us can find a x100 bagger before then.

j4zi6b|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|3|Something i don't understand. If melvin is the single biggest trader of GME today, they know where the price will go. I.e. they can first buy calls, cover shorts and run the price up to 40$, sell calls for profit, buy puts and let it fade. Sell puts for profit, repeat. Or is that considered market manipulation? Or can we predict their actions by observing open interest changes in the option chain?|2021-01-13 12:25:49

Draftkings sits at a market cap of around 40b and they do not have a streaming service. Fubo is sitting around 2.5b. If they can grow their gambling business, which should be easy given they already have a subscriber base, we could see a huge jump in the next year or so. Also, fubo was trading in the 60s a few weeks ago but dropped down to the 30s. Could easily see a run back to the 60s and beyond in the coming months|2021-01-13 08:00:19

They can probably even expire 1/15 - even if X=1 you will be along for the ride.  I honestly doubted this moon shot shit but decided fuck it and made a small play in December because this place has made some incredible calls. I was down a lot for a while but I held because fuck it. I'm now up more than I could have ever imagined. The short squeeze thesis still holds and I honestly believe we're looking at the beginning.

It's up about 30% today to around 10.50-ish and I've been in since around 5/6.  Price target is mid-20s leading up to phase 3 clinicals for Sumifilam (sp? they changed it slightly I know) so I don't think it's too late but you know how biotech goes... this is a FUCK ALZHEIMER'S play btw.|2021-01-13 13:03:43

j4kvju|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|1|GME had 250% short interest.  lot of the weed stocks are heavily shorted.  May be a good time to buy calls an hope for a short squeeze there too on the structural changes going on with the weed industry.  CRON has 1.3B in the bank. market cap of 3.8B and 11% short interest.  short interest should go to 5% with good news flow coming out of decriminalization|2021-01-13 10:37:41

j4ej3c|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|1|guys just a warning on GME: as soon as the morning volume is going to drop GME is going to fade and give up some gains. Simple options selling and MMs selling some shares they bought as a hedge. Same thing happened with PLTR already. If volume can keep up I'd say you are safe to diamond hand.

The Q3 numbers fubo reported (58% paid subscriber increase and 71% surge in revenue) were impressive, and the Q4 preliminary report shows a surprisingly strong increase in both metrics. The strategic acquisitions of Balto and Vigtory increase fubo’s competitiveness, and they will release a sports book app by the end of the year. The legal allegations against fubo seem to be without merit, and the stock has shot up over 34% in a day in spite of the allegations, so that should be telling.

All the real companies are already overbought, so people are looking for something - anything - to put their money in.  Worst part is, I don't really know what to sell. Too scared of losing out on more upside, so I'm just holding... as is everyone else. When the music stops, things are going to correct hard.  Seriously though, Gamestop? Who even buys physical copies of games anymore?  \*edit\* Yeah, I get that GME is a special situation. The point about the broader market still stands.

I dunno, still need to do more research, but I just get a good vibe.

j3v34m|kwe7q7|kwe7q7|-6|My daily PSA (reminder) for QQQJ ---------------------------------------------------------  If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**.   It is attractive because: 1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials. 2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ. 3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap.  ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums. 4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually.   I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January!   Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.   Have a nice day and make a lot of teddies today!  P.S. The most liquid strike and expiration is $35c June. But looking at how it's moving even before earning season, i think even the $40c June will be ITM and print bigly before June.
