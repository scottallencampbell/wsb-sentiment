jv8dmy|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|17|For you people who dont get it.  BB is rising for several reasons   -it switched its business years ago to a software company, has done good revenue of like 200 mil per quarter but the stock didnt really rise to reflect that. It was still down because too many saw it as a phone company. So its been a sleeping giant  in an industry where other  companies are going at like 50x p/e ratios and shit.  -185 million cars currently use BB software   -Deal with AWS is gonna be huge. A lot of that pump got erased for no real reason.  -BB has over 10,000 patents and is suing companies like fb and snap who infringed on some of those. They also sold some of their old phone patents.  -Cybersecurity wasnt in high demand during their last earnings. A few weeks later the biggest hacking in the world . Its hugely in demand now.|2021-01-19 14:18:01

In a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Yellen said she planned to start a new Treasury "hub" that would examine financial system risks arising from climate change and on related tax policy incentives. She also intends to appoint a "very senior-level" official to lead climate efforts.  **BOTTOM LINE:** Buy shares and calls of ICLN, QCLN, PBW.|2021-01-19 13:22:01

At around $11 a share, it is still a massive steal. I will be continually adding more capital to this stock over the next couple of months.🚀🚀🚀|2021-01-19 11:47:55

Through covid, I've had the fortune of making enough money, and also work from home. If I make any big gains, I think I should donate at least a portion to those less fortunate.  EDIT: looking into my food bank, and didn't realize just how badly they need food. Planning on sending them non-perishable food  WSB, do you have any favored charities?

jtkial|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|12|Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has initiated deployment of Palantir’s Foundry software to provide a single, integrated platform to give decision-makers a real-time, complete operational picture.  The use of this novel technology, in its early stages of deployment, has already enabled PG&E to make effective, timely, data-driven decisions related to its Public Safety Power Shutoff program and is intended to further inform its wildfire risk mitigation programs and initiatives in the future.  “Our engagement with California’s largest investor-owned utility underlines our commitment to increasing safety and reliability for customers and communities across the region,” said Olivier Farache, Palantir’s Head of Utility Sector and Senior Advisor to the CEO. “It shows our Foundry software can power data-driven decisions that aim to improve service delivery.”  This multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract marks the first time Palantir’s Foundry software is being used by a major U.S. utility’s operations. In the future, plans for Foundry include expanding to inform asset risk and outage investigation, eventually bringing in data from all aspects of the company’s operations to enable enterprise analytics and process improvement.

juh27l|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|6|PSA for anyone considering Tilray (TLRY):  Unless I am missing something, there is currently a substantial arbitrage gap between APHA and TLRY based on the conversion for the upcoming merger.  Upon merger, [1 APHA share converts to 0.8381 TLRY shares](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/aphria-tilray-merger-1.5843315)  TLRY shares currently trading at $18.81, if you take that as benchmark then APHA shares should be trading at $15.76 USD, but are currently trading at $12.45.   That is like a 22% ish arbitrage gap. If this deal goes through as-is (don't see why it wouldn't), then either APHA has to go up, TLRY has to come down, or some combination of the two.  If you take APHA share price as benchmark, TLRY should be trading at $14.86  Currently long APHA but tempted to play both legs (APHA calls and TLRY puts)   TLRY moonbois feel free to come pick this apart but from what I can see its just simple maths|2021-01-19 10:51:42

jubupq|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|4|Unless I am missing something, there is currently a substantial arbitrage gap between APHA and TLRY based on the conversion for the upcoming merger.  Upon merger, 1 APHA share converts to 0.8381 TLRY shares. TLRY shares currently trading at $18.67, if you take that as benchmark then APHA shares should be trading at $15.65 USD, but are currently trading at $12.45.   That is like a 22% ish arbitrage gap. If this deal goes through as-is (don't see why it wouldn't), then either APHA *has* to go up, TLRY *has* to come down, or some combination of the two.

jugimt|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|4|I really don't understand how these big financial firms can just "downgrade" a stock and it just falls based on that. SPCE for example, obviously these big firms have a giant interest in getting into the stock before ARKX pumps it. Is there any fundamental reason to downgrade the stock? None at all, the industry is actually heating up and technologies are becoming more and more proven. All they have to do is say "we're downgrading the stock in our opinion because blah blah blah" and it dumps so they can buy in. It's fucking wild.|2021-01-19 10:47:35

juiqfh|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|1|NOT TALKING ABOUT GEE SHMEM SHMEE but fellow retards, in light of recent... market events... I've become worried and obsessed with the fear that corporate interests/the American government are going to start restricting our freedom to lose our own money. I got anticipatory FOMO.  I'm pretty politically liberal generally but if they take away my calls I'm going to get real fucken salty about my personal rights and freedoms, real quick.  I don't have a large enough attention span to do extensive DD on the kinds of restrictions on options trading they have in DE, for instance, but if we're moving towards something like  account minimums, I'm going to be pissed.  I turned $420 into $8k last year, took out 7k (car/credit cards), and am back around 2k.  Hopefully I can do it again, only this time I won't take my profits.  Alls I'm ranting about is that, ironically or not, they likely wouldn't prohibit anyone from buying some piece of shit pump-n-dump penny stock, while my four month out options derived from real established fucking growth companies are, "too risky."  So yeah, if you can calm me down about this with some hard logic and reason that I'm not seeing, I'd appreciate.|2021-01-19 11:04:15

Currently used for depression and OCD, but expanding into addiction and other disorders. This tech will revolutionize mental health treatment and will offer major competition against big pharma.

Remember to make a post regarding any kind of rumors about future DoD (Department of Defense) contracts as when they go public on Defense.gov they will moon short term - long term depending on the tendies they will be giving them.  Example is $NGA mooning from 🌈Cramer’s🐻 autistic loving ass from his vaccine shot post with $NGA on his laptop.  How is this a DoD rumor example? Well listen here go look at their announcement with Cramer or just look at the [Color](https://imgur.com/gallery/RzRB3FG) fuckin Army Green.  Need more? Well I know you retards can’t read let alone read [French](https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/entreprises/2021-01-06/amazon-pret-a-acheter-des-milliers-de-camions-lion.php) all you have to do is piece together Amazon = Amazon in English and let me assist those wrinkles trying to form in your brain.

jto5q7|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|-11|What’s the easiest way to buy a couple GME stocks at opening?  I’m a 36yr old unemployed quadriplegic that’s never bought a stock in my life. I don’t know shit about the market but I’ve been lurking for a few weeks on wsb watching you tards and learning a thing or two. Been seeing a lot of chatter about GME and I want in on this ride.  So here’s the deal, I have less than $100 to my name and want to hitch a ride on this tendie train to the moon. I just want to buy 1 or 2 GME stocks with cash. Not on margin cause 1) I’m not entirely sure wtf that is yet and 2) I have shit for credit being unemployed and on disability so my bank probably won’t even approve it. Is it even possible to buy a couple GME stocks with money in my bank account? And how/where do I do it at? Help me become an autist like you guys pls and thanks.|2021-01-19 06:30:39

ju6ksz|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|-1|Listen up retards.  Take this free DD for what it’s worth.  Nothing,  because you’re all too cheap to pay me for my amazing insight even though you’ll yolo your grandmother’s rent money on HTZX. I’ve been watching Faber and Cramer since 2000.  Faber is sincere and ethical and tells you exactly what he’s thinking even if he may be wrong.  No Machiavelli in him.  He’s a long suffering Mets fan who has no guile. He’s thoughtful and reads the great philosophers when he’s bored. He keeps this to himself because why would he waste his time talking to idiots about the great thinkers of our species. Cramer is another animal.  He’s a showman who will say things he knows are wrong to spur debate and argument and ratings.  He’s like that one young teacher you had that was fun and interesting and stayed at your school for two years until he realized all of the other teachers and faculty were fools just phoning it in and that he could make a lot more money outside of education.  Neither are on our side or against us.  And they shouldn’t be but they provide a lot of info. On a lot of things.  Now that English guy.  He’s a total chump.  He’s a blue blood who looks down upon us all and still calls Americans colonists when in a room full of his limey buddies from the blue blood prep school where he matriculated. He’s not worthless.  He’s a great contrarian indicator.  If you want a friend get a dog.  This thread is all about the trendies. Think I’ll get banned for using “limey”?|2021-01-19 09:29:45

jtlgwb|l0hnrw|l0hnrw|-8|Serious question as I’m $22,000 deep in GME and considering adding more today: is investopedia correct and is this actually a warning for longs to bail or are they trying to flush the 🧻🖐?  “allows investors to exit long positions before short selling occurs.“  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp  The Alternative Uptick Rule The 2010 alternative uptick rule (Rule 201) allows investors to exit long positions before short selling occurs. The rule is triggered when a stock price falls at least 10% in one day. At that point, short selling is permitted if the price is above the current best bid.1﻿ This aims to preserve investor confidence and promote market stability during periods of stress and volatility.|2021-01-19 05:53:33

Gov't are a bunch of thieves.  Anyone replying here telling me i'm wrong is only saying so until they come after our gains and say any extraordinary options returns should be taxed additionally. Top 1% of options returns should have a 30% tax. Why shouldn't we take 300k from jimmies 1m that he got from 20k in TSLA options?? its only fair, right? Think of the children it could help!
