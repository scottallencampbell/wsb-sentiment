If fed is going for 2.5-2.75 target then bonds should be atleast 1% higher at 3.5-3.75%. But with inflation going up over 8% over soon and higher interest rates the bonds begin to sell off due to low interest of buyers.  Rule of thumb with cpi is that if 10yr goes up then inflation should go down and vice versa. Monday tuesday 10yr sold off and will sell off more . We see hot inflation today.

87pek8|un6c3p|un6c3p|11|We're officially in uncharted territory now that AAPL has finally broken down and fallen below its key support level of 150.  AAPL was the final safe haven, that $2.7 trillion island in the storm that held the S&P 500 together.  There's no safe place to hide now.  I think you want to look for what we saw in February; a huge volume flush and a massive turnaround day like we saw on Jan 24 or Feb 24.  SPY volume needs to get up to the 200+ million range for a panic bottom to develop; this selloff is way too orderly right now.  VIX is below 40 and has remained there even after 5 continuous weeks of selling; that's very unusual for there to be little panic at this point of 5 weeks of selling.  I'm looking for some kind of '-3% open that turns to +2% close' or a '-1% open that drops to -4% then goes back up to +2% close'; just to describe potential short-term bottom scenarios.  Obviously we may not get that, but that's what a panic bottom looks like.|2022-05-11 13:02:24

That was the most critical line in the sand for mega caps; 150 was the July-November 2021 resistance level and then became support when it broke out; it bounced hard off 150 in March as well.  This is the first break below 150 for AAPL since its November 16 breakout when it charged towards 180+.  AAPL's chart has finally turned bearish due to this breakdown below 150 and that means all mega cap/large tech charts are bearish.  I think this is the first real sign of capitulation on mega caps.

87k26e|un6c3p|un6c3p|10|I started investing more seriously in early 2019. I was being so smart and DCA'ing in a measured way into the COVID dip. I wanted to track what people smarter than me were saying. I watched CNBC. Cramer said to sell the next rip because it wouldn't be permanent. I was skeptical. I did. The rip kept ripping. I looked back at some of my sells from then and I would've 3x'd some decent positions. I was pissed. I stayed out of the market. Last January I saw the euphoria. I slowly started buying in thinking I wouldn't miss out this time. All of my positions are down. Am I retarded? Yes. Is it my fault? Yes. Will I ever recover? No.      Thanks for listening|2022-05-11 12:27:46

Adjusted for one-time items, the company lost $1.43 a share.   >   >Rivian made 2,553 vehicles in the quarter, and delivered 1,227 vehicles, which generated $95 million in revenue, the company said.   >   >Analysts polled by FactSet expected the EV maker to report an adjusted loss of $1.49 a share on sales of $133 million.   >   >“We remain focused on ramping production throughout 2022,” the company said in its letter to shareholders.   >   >Supply-chain “constraints” will continue to limit production, but based on the “latest understanding of the supply-chain environment,” Rivian reaffirmed its guidance to make about 25,000 vehicles in the year.

86fkdn|un6c3p|un6c3p|5|There's no way inflation falls below 4% in the next 18 months without a recession.  That's a prediction that I assume many of us share here.  Bond's have been telling us that by pricing yields (3% on the 10 year) well above the neutral rate (around 2-2.25% on the 10 year), and now stocks are finally catching up to bonds and telling us that a real slowdown that will feel/look like a recession is probably going to be required to bring inflation back to 2-3% quickly.  &#x200B;  And yet, JPow and the Fed continue to act as if inflation is transitory.  They're literally acting as if a couple rate hikes back to 2% will fix everything and inflation will magically fall back to 3% by the end of the year.  Maybe they're right, but they were telling us inflation would be transitory all last year when it first started hitting 4-5% and they ignored all common sense and kept pumping liquidity into the economy at 0% rates.  The Fed's strategy is "hope and prayers" at this point; they're going to do another 50 basis point hike or two and hope inflation naturally comes back down to 2%.  It's possible they're right, but all the evidence points to inflation taking a very long time to drift down naturally.  Look at how oil/gas prices work.  Any time you get a big spike in oil prices, gas prices stay high much longer than oil prices do.  Oftentimes oil prices fall 20-30% below their peak while gas prices remain near their peak for months beyond.  Only recessions/economic slowdowns can really halt inflation by forcibly reducing demand and bringing supply/demand back into balance.|2022-05-11 07:54:25

8706f2|un6c3p|un6c3p|2|Something interesting happened yesterday. There was a lawsuit between Appian and Pega which resulted in Pega having to pay a little over 2 billion to Appian. The problem is Pega's market cap is 4 billion so the fine is half of their market cap. Their cash on hand is like 150 million so there's no way they can pay the fine. Pega will appeal the verdict so they won't actually be paying anything anytime soon.  Has there been a lawsuit which caused a company to go bankrupt because of its inability to pay a fine to a competitor? Especially in the enterprise software sector.  There's no way to make money off this because the appeal will be tied up for years at the very least.|2022-05-11 10:19:30

87dmxj|un6c3p|un6c3p|2|ngl glad COIN taking a shit they a bunch of scammers.   They lend you USD at 8+% APR if you put up your corn as collateral. That's not the scam part. The scam part is that after you give them your corn they still expect the borrower to take the risk that corn might dump and no longer cover their ridiculous margin requirements for the loan. You have to put upwards of 250% of the loan's value in corn and if it falls under they sell your collateral to pay themselves back.      I'm guaranteeing you an APR and monthly payments you want to have that and guaranteed asset values on your books too you scum?|2022-05-11 11:46:22

86th6t|un6c3p|un6c3p|6|Guys, fake business news networks told me inflation is over because of a slight drop by 2 decimal points putting inflation still at 40 year all time highs. Analysts and professionals with no early access predicted "peak inflation" two days ago...somehow.  That 8.3% is also 100%(*0 )accurate. Definitely not double digits, the pros adjusted the criteria for our safety.  Imflation is over! Already gas has dropped to $1, and grocery prices down 78% via hallucinogenic delusion   We are saved! 8.3 instead of 8.5! The war is over. Gaaawwdddd bwwesss ammerriiicaaa!!

I tried various clubs but none of them understood me when I asked I wanted to meet yakuza.   I met a UKpoor there and he was kind enough to tell me I need to speak Japanese with them.   Hence I had been spending the last month learning Japanese until I received a call. I was so happy to hear english words after a month. But the polite lady on call said she was margin call.

The market has such blue balls right now wanting a rally that I think ultimately CPI decreasing slightly will be enough to push a bullish narrative over the next week or so.  We might have to dump one more time, but I think the 380-390 range is a psychological bottom for most and we will see a rally before the next dose of CPI comes out next month.|2022-05-11 12:21:52

8643jy|un6c3p|un6c3p|0|I know I'm a retard for still using robinhood but I also use etrade. But ya rh is fuked. I have instant deposits for $1k. So I deposit 1k. 1k comes out of my bank. I buy some options and then upgrade to gold so I can have 5k of instant deposits. I deposit 4k more. Then they "flag" my deposit and tell me in fact it will take a week to clear and I won't in fact have instant access to even the initial 1k. So now my rh account has a "deifict" that they have "covered" for me but my account is -553.5 because I sold the options for a loss to buy something else. I canceled the 4k deposit before it went through but I can't cancel rh gold because apparently they took the $5 fee out of my instant deposit which has been taken from my bank account but hasn't cleared yet...what a fucking shit show!|2022-05-11 06:08:32

87mmr3|un6c3p|un6c3p|-10|biden my grandmother  was a democrat my mother is a democrat i voted obama i love the democrat "ideals" but the reality is you have completely lost the younger generation to the temptations of security and wealth from the other side. the democrats are either too naive up top or ignorant to realize what fear their narrative keeps many americans under. my mother has been  a lifelong victim and i refuse to adopt the same victim mentality that you want me to keep to stay under your control. we are stronger and more capable and more forgiving than this. the examples we have shown the rest of the world these past couple years have been embarrassing. what is the point of taking the high road if you get lost while driving. america is a trainwreck crashing every single day.  the most frustrating thing is we are all capable of so much more but we put our faith in our leaders because you humbly ASKED and we believed you. now we need you. like really need you. so please, do something. i dont need you to "win" to validate my beliefs. i dont need the democrats to have anything to gloat over. i dont need the republicans to feel guilty, i just need us all to come together and be happy to be american and be grateful for the opportunities we can create for each other if we LISTEN to what each other have to say. the demonization is so childish. the older generation has been EXPOSED for the silly greedy paranoid that they are. they want war, they want division, they dont want peace or understanding because they can't comprehend that in their own lives where they have failed marriages and broken hearts that divide their spirit so they crave that conflict internally and externally but the healthy, young, hopeful DO NOT NEED THIS CONSTANT DIVIDE. WE ARE NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER, WE ALL NEED THE SAME THING UNDER GOD UNDER WHATEVER BELIEF YOU HAVE IT REQUIRES RESPECT AND PATIENCE. STRENGTH AND LOVE.   &#x200B;  We can't forget what this means, we can't forget how to love each other. or the alternative will always get it's way. please if anyone took the time to read this, i hope it resonates with you true. i am so sick of this back and forth that keeps us from ever truly progressing. i am so ready for something new, and something cool we can all appreciate together...doesn't that sound awesome ?   or is there absolutely no way to profit from that attitude, so therefore wrong. im just trying to make sense of all this.|2022-05-11 12:44:16
