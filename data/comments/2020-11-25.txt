dktekm|k0qaqw|k0qaqw|6|Here is my response to the guy who was removed for shit posting his being upset about missing PLTR   This is a long term game, and nobody wins, you just survive. You survived this week. I had shares at 9.80 and was out at 15. Fuck me. Oh well. Blowing up is worse than missing the big one. And this is like the 20th big one this year, of which I only hit once and then lost it being a bear. There will be more. So many more speculative industries will get hot... Hydrogen, space, pharma and even more gov contracting.   If it's actually making you suicidal you gotta talk to someone. We are all addicted to the stonk market to various extents, but IMO you should begin to develop more of a numbness than an obsession|2020-11-25 12:30:30

dl5bwc|k0qaqw|k0qaqw|13|Most here won't remember the early days of the Iraq war. UAVs didn't exist. Seriously, it was a time before drones.  20 years later, there isn't a battlefield in the world that isn't dominated by drones. See the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict for mid tier conflicts and ISIS insurgency (from the savages point of view) for low tier conflicts.   The next 10-20 years of warfare will be dominated by algorithms and datasets. The DOD as a whole (every single branch of the military, and all the civil support sectors) is being pushed HARD to algorithmic warfare/operations.  PLTR is the only major player in algorithmic warfare. Their software is custom built explicitly for this specialty (integration of compartmentalized data - and you can't get more compartmentalized than the DOD). Currently 50B market cap (against 1B in earnings). That is still cheap for this sector and specialty. Other big tech won't play in these fields due their SJW rainbow-colored hair employees that spend their time worrying about what pronouns to display on their social media   It's a $50/share (yes, \~90B market cap) company purely off the government work alone. Factor in the push to commercial sector and we're talking realistically 75-100.  I know you retards don't like shares, but this is a retirement stock. Buy the shares or leaps. The algorithmic warfare age is just beginning.  I Just set a GTC sell order at $75 / share. Just gotta refresh it every 60 days or so. Someday I'll be fucking my young gorgeous girlfriend and my phone will ping me, a trade notification for PLTR @ $75. I'll finish on her face and then call my accountant, causes that's gonna be a nasty year for taxes for me. Then I'll be officially yacht-level retired.   It'll hit within three years. You retards can try to play the dips (and yes, a correction is coming), but i'll play the long game.      RemindMe! One Year|2020-11-25 14:09:27

I wonder if this is a sort of natural selection. Person X buys options on stock A and gets rich. He ‚Äúsurvives‚Äù to keep recommending similar options. Enough of these ppl and you get a trend. But we don‚Äôt hear much from those who don‚Äôt survive (Person Y) because they lose their $ on their options play and therefore can‚Äôt recommend that play or even have the $ to back another play. And since meme stocks tend to just shoot up without much logic, it just accelerates the trend and hype on subreddits and among investors overall.|2020-11-25 11:57:46

djxxg8|k0qaqw|k0qaqw|34|To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to invest in Palatir. The product is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of coding and hacking most of the tech will go over a typical investors head. There's also societies nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into a dystopian high tech future- this philosophy draws heavily from Orwellian literature, for instance. The PLTR investor understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this company, to realize that they're not just a company- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PLTR ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the inclination in PLTRs motto "We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it." which itself is a cryptic reference to Huxleys magnum opus Brave New World. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Alexander Karp's genius wit unfolds itself on their brokerage sites. What fools.. how I pity them.|2020-11-25 07:59:58

dkaxt5|k0qaqw|k0qaqw|3|So when companies realize they can save an actual shit ton of money by having most employees work from home, we will begin to see some epic collapses. Public transportation will take a huge hit, business that rely on business workers being in offices in the city, commercial real estate, housing in many city centers, all of these will begin collapsing.   We are talking many public companies losing 30-40% of their sales (*looking at you starbucks*) as people don't feel assed to go out of their homes and drive to a starbucks that's 5-10 minutes away.  I just don't see how this ends well for a lot of sectors unless the governments gives huge tax incentives to bring people back into the office, but are we already past that point? Companies have already received so many tax breaks and bailout money that the government won't have much else to offer. It's scary times ahead|2020-11-25 10:01:03

dkosuc|k0qaqw|k0qaqw|2|So I‚Äôve been thinking what could be a great meme stock and I think SLV is where it‚Äôs at. It‚Äôs market cap is 12.85B whereas PLTR is 52.46B and NIO is 71.53B. IV is low asf so if we all start piling in that‚Äôll shoot up. Also, someone on here mentioned that if the average account here is $1k (it‚Äôs much more) then we‚Äôd have 1.2B collectively. This is enough to own 1/10 of the SLV ETF. But as I said we have more than that so in reality we could own 1/5 or more of it. Thoughts?|2020-11-25 11:53:09

It went up significantly two days ago and then again yesterday and even more today.  Question:   this has happened to me before on Dow long calls and puts and I wait   too long to sell and lose most of my gains. So how do I not do that this   time? Set a stop limit sell order at a certain number?  It's   12/24 expiry bought at 2.766 and now selling around 9.5. Put a stop at   8.0 and forgettaboutit? Give it a little more room to fall down to 7.5   or 7.0? 6.5? See, I'm hopeless at selling. I'm decent at buying but  not  at selling.  HELP|2020-11-25 14:59:08

dk7r1q|k0qaqw|k0qaqw|3|Mega tip: REI-UN.TO  Riocan Real Estate Investment Trust  Property group, look at the chart, this is guaranteed to go up big time once things start to go back to normal. It was trading close to $27 before the pandemic, it‚Äôs currently sitting at $18 and I got in at $15 just a few weeks ago, and it‚Äôs climbing up ever since the solid vaccine news came up. Even if this doesn‚Äôt go back to it‚Äôs pre-pandemic price, it‚Äôs expect to at least go back and stay above $20 soon.  Also, as a bonus, the divs are distributed monthly. So if you put in $20k rn, you‚Äôre getting a monthly return of $133.00  Short term and long term gains to be made, it‚Äôs an easy buy.  Edit: Also, look into Simon Property Group (SPG), in the same vein.|2020-11-25 09:33:51

Also yeah, a group of 1.5 million retard wallstreetbeters (me included) somehow have the secret knowledge that the merger would work out, and big money, hedge funds and soros have absolutely no idea about the merger and that this merger can triple their entire net worth within a single announcement.  Downright a fucking pump and dump, yeah they won't lose that much $$ but the idiots who believe that it will triple their money are going to be really butthurt and look for someone else to blame.

dksc7c|k0qaqw|k0qaqw|5|Guys I really need advice. I am feeling suicidal and need help... My mind is driving me insane.   PLTR is the first company I ever felt confident to invest 10K in calls ending in December. I decided not to and I purchased shares then. It rose too fast for the past month and now when I look at the calls I am confident of buying, I see a 260x ROI at $26. Even though my shares more than doubled, I have never felt more depressed and suicidal in my life. I tried smiling, even selling of my shares at 10K profit and deleted RobinHood, yet I can't forgive myself for buying shares instead of that call... The one call I never felt more confident in my life. The only one Call I truly wanted to buy but hesitant too. The once in a lifetime opportunity to be a millionaire... I'm now immune to the price, dropping $20 or rising $20 in the next minute won't make me feel any better...   I think some of you may have experienced this before. Punching the wall till you bleed, cutting yourself and just wanting to give up on life for the once in a lifetime opportunity of becoming a millionaire. The 10K I was so confident in and ready to lose back then. I may never get the chance again with this level of confidence. I hope I can feel better after today, after deleting the app and getting a nap...   I know this is not the place but I really hope some of you which experienced this previously can share how you overcome this torture, how you get your life back together knowing you made a mistake that costs you millions... When your life can really change with the money.  Sorry for shitposting and insult me all you want at my ungratefulness. I feel slightly better writing this but am still in unbelievable pain right now...  Edit: I really truly appreciate all your comment guys. I will take a break from trading and from this forum for a while. There are other opportunities out there. I had the gut right feel that time. I will be back stronger than ever. Cheers!|2020-11-25 12:21:55
