5pqaxq|doo98t|doo98t|7|I honestly hardly see a likely scenario where the market doesnt sell off tomorrow, at least a little bit.  Ways the market could rally:  * You get your quarter point, and JPow is super dovish when he speaks (The fed meeting minutes last time specifically said they would do the opposite of this)  * You get a half verse a quarter point cut?  Ways the market would want to correct:  * You get no cut at all  * You get a quarter point, but JPows rhetoric is much more hawkish (Minutes said the fed fears the market is pricing in way too many cuts, and they need to realign expectations)  * You get a cut, and Jpow tippy toes around further cuts (this seems to be apparently what the market has priced in, in which case this becomes a sell the news type of event)  The latter 2 scenarios are so much more likely than any of the others, I dont see how you're not at least hedging to the downside. Couple that with "Earnings bad, global data bad, but Stonks go up", and this fucking thing is going to make a decent move to the downside.|2019-10-29 11:09:43

The company dropped 20% because of a lockout period ending in which early investors sold off their shares which even at $80 saw a lot of them some 3x initial investment.   The company also made a profit this quarter and boosted guidance which some analysts are already saying is too conservative. The only real concern the company has is competition which will of course eat into their profits but thats a longer term problem than my 12/20 exp.   Long $BYND|2019-10-29 09:23:58

No trendlines have changed and the market moved exactly [as we predicted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/do7bfc/daily_discussion_thread_october_28_2019/f5mworo/)-- flat as Megan Fox's ass. Given the round of shitty earnings released AH I see on my feed, we may trade down to a lower tier of bullish ranges. Those ranges are 303.2-302.15. In general, however we're liable to stay flat as everyone waits with bated breath for the FOMC and AAPL/FB. The market will react after the release of both of those news.

5pigip|doo98t|doo98t|3|Despite my bearish positions I'm actually for rate cuts because my retirement is bond heavy.   I have my bearish short term positions though because I'm not buying this 97% stat for the rate cut on CBOE. A month ago that stat was 50/50. A month ago the top headwind was tradewars which has objectively deescalated (see SPY ATH). Bad macros? Those improved. Are they going to assume they were immediate effects of the cuts or was it a sign that we need to wait longer to check the effects? A smart fed would choose the latter.   Here's the bear thesis but it seems way too optimistic that JPow would decide to further cut rates at this lvl. Theres a reason he didn't cut 50bp last time. I think he's going to leave rates alone and announce more non-QE.   tldr, stocks can very likely go down in the short term. Doesn't say anything about the economy. More to do with traders being way too bullish.|2019-10-29 09:42:37

I think the most likely scenario is that JPow cuts rates by a quarter, and is fuckin realistic with the market when he says there probably won't be any more cuts through 2020.

5pnxit|doo98t|doo98t|5|Let me explain to you all how Disney works. Disney is one of the stocks that is going to slowly go up over time. $130 and below is always an entry point for this stock.    Hedge funds want in, but the issue for is that it rarely drops below that point after the Disney+ announcement, and when it does drop that low, few people are willing to sell and volume drops substantially.  Since hedge firms that want to buy in below $130, they start pumping money in but that drives the price back up. Since volume is so low below $130, this has been consistently happening as hedge funds load up for the long term at each drop.  Then at around $131, at low volume, a few non hedge fund profit takers jump ship and the cycle continues indefinitely.  I've been saying this time and time again. The best way to profit off Disney is to buy shares and sit on them for a year. Never buy options on such a flat stock.|2019-10-29 10:44:13

5qes2d|doo98t|doo98t|2|Is it too much to ask the Algo’s that control our trading to let a $.30 dip happen without the immediate reversal within 30 seconds? You know what I’m talking about ----------($303.30--$303.14--$303.02--$303.24) all within 30 seconds of each other.. What is this telling us? We literally have machine doing all the trading and any time the market sells off quickly the algo’s are programmed to immediately buy back to the spot of the first breakdown candle. That’s why you see so many dramatic “V” shape recoveries now. This type of price movement rarely ever happened back in the early 2000’s. It was just different action and hard to explain. But you never saw those immediate “V’s” like you do now. Different age with super computers running off algorithms.|2019-10-29 14:10:38

5qa2g0|doo98t|doo98t|4|Just took out a 15K loan for some insane interest rate like 30% of some gay shit. What do I yolo it on? Also, can I get margin on st8 calls on schwab? like can I go 80/20 with them and just owe 20% if I lose, or are they too smart for that? I already did a $5K deposit on robinhood when I didn't have the money in my account, so it bounced, now I already owe them 5K & I have like 10K in CC debt, so for my yolo I'm looking to at least get out with 40K~, so hoping for a 3X or something, lots of interesting earnings happening, but still waiting to get my schwab verified so might have to wait until next week. Give advice pls. If I lose I just off myself so it's no worries about the debt anyways.|2019-10-29 13:43:03
