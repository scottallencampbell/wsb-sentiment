o2s7sb|g5cllb|g5cllb|65|This is a fair warning to all of the bulls out there:  You have just seen what happens to a market that refuses to accept factual reality. Oil has had a significant decline in demand, and the supply continued at essentially the same level as prior to the shutdown. Suddenly, everyone is "surprised" that there is a massive crash when the rubber hits the road - when it's time to actually take delivery of the physical oil, no one wants it.  The stock market is about to experience the same thing. I don't know if it'll be in a week or if it'll be in a few months, but it is coming. The price of a stock is predicated that the business issuing it is profitable. That there are profit margins in the day-to-day activities, that more money comes in then goes out. Right now, that is a very small number of businesses. The vast majority of our economy is taking out loans in order to stay afloat, have laid off large percentages of their employees, and has no significant revenue at this point. The customer base is who's being laid off, and $1,200 stimulus checks isn't going to go far.  You bulls who keep denying the reality that this is a black swan event of unparalleled history, and keep buying "the dip" - you can keep this bubble inflated for a little while, but when it finally pops, you're going to be in the slaughterhouse.   It happened during the 2008 crisis within the financial sector, brought on by denial of reality in the housing market. This is going to be bigger than that, because it's not just housing that's over inflated in value - we've shut down essentially the entire economy. If you're trying to make the case that the economy should be near where it was before we shut down, harsh reality is coming for you.|2020-04-21 07:39:24

o3fm7w|g5cllb|g5cllb|24|This is a fair warning to all of the bulls out there:  You have just seen what happens to a market that refuses to accept factual reality. Oil has had a significant decline in demand, and the supply continued at essentially the same level as prior to the shutdown. Suddenly, everyone is "surprised" that there is a massive crash when the rubber hits the road - when it's time to actually take delivery of the physical oil, no one wants it.  The stock market is about to experience the same thing. I don't know if it'll be in a week or if it'll be in a few months, but it is coming. The price of a stock is predicated that the business issuing it is profitable. That there are profit margins in the day-to-day activities, that more money comes in then goes out. Right now, that is a very small number of businesses. The vast majority of our economy is taking out loans in order to stay afloat, have laid off large percentages of their employees, and has no significant revenue at this point. The customer base is who's being laid off, and $1,200 stimulus checks isn't going to go far.  You bulls who keep denying the reality that this is a black swan event of unparalleled history, and keep buying "the dip" - you can keep this bubble inflated for a little while, but when it finally pops, you're going to be in the slaughterhouse.  It happened during the 2008 crisis within the financial sector, brought on by denial of reality in the housing market. This is going to be bigger than that, because it's not just housing that's over inflated in value - we've shut down essentially the entire economy. If you're trying to make the case that the economy should be near where it was before we shut down, harsh reality is coming for you.|2020-04-21 11:21:18

Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand.    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it    Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.    The darkness drops again; but now I know    That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born.|2020-04-21 13:07:45

o40wjq|g5cllb|g5cllb|4|$USO update:   4/21/20, 1:50 PM United States Oil Fund LP (USO) on Tuesday announced it would diversify its exposure to futures contracts reflecting the price of crude oil in an effort to smooth out its value. The exchange-traded fund has lost nearly one-third of its value in the week to date, as the global glut of oil weighs on prices. Beginning Tuesday, USO will invest approximately 40% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts for June, approximately 55% of its portfolio in contracts for July, and approximately 5% of its portfolio in crude oil contracts for August. The changes for the largest and most liquid oil ETF comes after the product was blamed for helping to amplify a steep decline in crude-oil prices, highlighted by a historic plunge of the May contract for West Texas Intermediate oil trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange closing at negative $37.63 a barrel on Monday, marking a historic drop for the front-month contract and sending waves throughout the energy complex. USO's previous structure meant that the fund owned 80% of its portfolio in crude futures in the front month contract and approximately 20% in crude futures and ICE Futures in the second-month contract, except when the front-month is within two weeks away from expiration. The ETF was halted for trading twice on Tuesday but resumed at 2:35 PM having lost about 33% for the day.|2020-04-21 14:11:34

The problem I see here is, if CL2 gets to $6-8 range, CME will raise cash margin on USO, forcing USO to derisk, selling CL2 before it becomes negative price again -  Keep in mind USO holds 30% of open interest in CL2 and has 80% of CL2 in the USO ETF... so basically this will create a negative feedback loop and further exacerbate price action... so long story short, HUGE negative convexity to downside in CL2 AND USO at $8 - because USO could liquidate and go to 0  Not my analysis- analysis of a PM who I know|2020-04-21 12:33:54

o3lrs8|g5cllb|g5cllb|4|So theres a chance the June oil futures flip negative too. If thats the case, there are tankers for rent in texas/oklahoma for <$2000 for month for about 8500 gallons, which is a cost of about 25 cents per gallon per month.  [https://www.rentalyard.com/listings/trailers/for-rent/list/category/15118/semi-trailers-tank-trailers-crude-oil](https://www.rentalyard.com/listings/trailers/for-rent/list/category/15118/semi-trailers-tank-trailers-crude-oil)  So why not this plan:   \-Call some oil tanker owners in oklahoma, get contract ready to rent tankers  \-If oil drops below a dollar or two (a little leeway to make extra $ to pay for a parking spot for the truck or something and to have money to rent tanker for months), buy up some futures, sign contracts with oil tankers  \-Fly to cushing, take delivery, and let oil sit in trucks until prices go back up. At that point, sell to whoever would buy it  Is there anything wrong with that logic?|2020-04-21 12:10:39

Plan your trades and stick to the plan.  You can not manipulate a stock, though the stock is being manipulated.  All you can do is roll with the wave and take your profits when you make them.

Barring BA taking a catastrophic downturn, I shouldn't get margin called.  What are the odds BA rips up to retest 150 before earnings? If I had to, is it worth trying to pay roughly $4500 to hold for a year to save myself losing 20K? Or should I cut my losses since this shit may never retest 150 (or it wont for years potentially?)   Only things saving me I can think of are the MAXs flying again or Gov't intervention. But 135 has seemed to be a strong point of support.|2020-04-21 12:15:35

Maybe restricted to trading blocks for 90day or a fee. Gonna call the broker and find out if it‚Äôs 90day vs the Fee.   My thoughts are take the fee, but 90 days?
