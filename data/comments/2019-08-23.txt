Economic situation isn't THAT bad, and we need to save those stimulus options for the day where we need them.

xtmfgn|cuccqv|cuccqv|3|>‚ÄúBecause the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a year or more, the Committee must attempt to look through what may be passing developments and focus on things that seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that pose a material risk of doing so,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut fitting trade policy uncertainty into this framework is a new challenge. Setting trade policy is the business of Congress and the Administration, not that of the Fed.‚Äù  So he's saying the Fed must be forward looking by 1 year even if current data is good. The question is do they view the trade war as a "passing development" or as something that "seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that pose a material risk of doing so."     >"Setting trade policy is the business of Congress and the Administration, not that of the Fed."     This sentence could be interpreted in two ways. Pro-cut: We have to cut because Trump is forcing our hand there's nothing we can do. Against-cut: If we cut based only on the trade war, we are effectively endorsing the trade war and that's not our job.     I dunno what do you guys think?|2019-08-23 09:41:12

xtnf2z|cuccqv|cuccqv|2|Serious question: Working through the process of selling covered calls...  I have 100 shares of XYZ. I bought them at 30$ today. I sell a call for 8/30 with a strike price of 35$ for a premium of 1$. If the stock is at 40$ on 8/30 I sell at 35$ + 1$= 36$. I still make 600$.  The only way you truly lose money on a covered call is if the stock slips past your (entry price - premium collected) and if you then sell the stock for a loss because you don't want to hold it any longer?  Seems like a pretty low risk situation to me. Please clarify if I have this completely wrong, just trying to learn here.|2019-08-23 09:49:14

The test came after Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.  >Speaking at a meeting of his Security Council, Putin charged that the U.S. waged a ‚Äúpropaganda campaign‚Äù alleging Russian breaches of the pact to ‚Äúuntie its hands to deploy the previously banned missiles in different parts of the world.‚Äù  >He ordered the Defense Ministry and other agencies to ‚Äútake comprehensive measures to prepare a symmetrical answer.‚Äù  >The U.S. said it withdrew from the treaty because of Russian violations, a claim that Moscow has denied.  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/putin-orders-russian-military-to-respond-after-us-missile-test-2019-08-23?mod=mw_latestnews|2019-08-23 12:04:59

The IB app is showing wild portfolio fluctuations for me AH. I should have canceled out all bearish positions last by buying last minute 0-day calls (0-minute actually). What time is used to determine the settlement price, 4pm? I think I've read that the settlement price is determined by going through all 500 stocks of the S&P500 and looking at their actual closing price. And that 2,848.20 as displayed for the index at 4pm is just an estimate. Is that correct? I bought 2840s and one 2850 to counter my bearish positions.

Was up 40% overall at around 10.30 but held on because I didn't see any reason for my remaining CRM & MSFT positions to get fucked. Forgot about the risk of an Orange Swan event. Am at +25% overall but went against every instinct and am now balls deep in MSFT again. I don't understand why it should suffer like this sans a real recession lol.  Anyway, next two weeks. If this oaf keeps getting control markets like this, I'm out. I have a good job, don't need this crap lol.

Schwab informs me that I am once again beating the S&P 500, by about 18 basis points since I started doing this back in February. That might not be impressive to you degenerate gamblers but as an active investor who's more interested in getting a nice income stream set up to fall back on if needed, the fact that I'm also beating the market is pretty neato. I've been investing very aggressively with almost no emergency fund, so there were a few times when I needed to eat the dividends, but mostly I've been letting it all reinvest and compound. Part of me wants to start diversifying into other asset classes, but part of me is really just addicted to buying REITs..
