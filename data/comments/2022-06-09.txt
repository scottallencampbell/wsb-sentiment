brq292|v8ddje|v8ddje|8|Let me educate you how this works so you stopped getting cucked bulls.   We drilled from 470 to 420 a while ago and the MMs let you run your little rally back to 450-460.  Then we drilled down to 380, which was admittedly too hard to fast, over 7 weeks.  MMs let you have a little weak rally where you stalled out at 410-418.   Gee, look what's happening now.  We are drilling yet again, and where's the bottom this time? 350-370?  The MMs will let you rally again, this time to 400 where you'll have a hard time breaking through. Then you drill again to 330.   See how this works?  They let the 'Bottom is in'!' crowd constantly load up due to their hopium and isnane fight the fed strategy.  It's better to miss 5-10% of the upside once the bottom is truly in than to be stuck with bags that can take multiple years to break even just because you you were mindlessly buying the dip or thought the bottom was in.|2022-06-09 14:46:04

Entertainment at its best. * Philosophical Cramer - Gives a long, winding INSANE explanation on stock x or market. The listener loses 10-20 IQ points and/or 10-20 K after exposure. * Yoda/Coked out/LSD Cramer - Slurs all kinds of shit like a crack addict in SF Mission, mostly about dead stocks or Alcoa, US Steel or his days in Goldman Sachs.

br2e6z|v8ddje|v8ddje|-3|Unlike the **QQQ** (Nasdaq), **IWM** (Russell) or **DIA** (Dow Jones), the **SPY** (S&P500) ETF has a very important requirement:  To join the S&P500 the company needs to be **profitable for 4 consecutive quarters**!   **$SPY** was engineered to constantly **go up** unlike all other ETFs in the sector that only have market cap requirements.  Unprofitable companies are delisted very quickly from SPY while QQQ is full of unprofitable garbage.   In 1970's companies remained in S&P500 on average for 30 years by 1990s it was down to 20 years and now its closer to 10 years on average.   Over the past decade, **50%** of the S&P 500 has been replaced. If the trend continues, approximately **75%** of companies on the index will be replaced by 2027. Unprofitable companies are delisted fast and are replaced with good profitable companies that work in the current economy! SPY does not baghold like Cathie Woods.    Don't listen to the bears 🌈🐻 Buy leaps to increase your leverage and retire early.  #$SPY 500c DEC 20 2024  *Sponsored by Jerome Powell and secretary Janet Yellen*|2022-06-09 11:57:55

It is disrupting trade, is leading to shortages of materials, and is contributing to high energy and commodity prices. These factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth, especially in the near term. However, the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow on account of the ongoing reopening of the economy, a strong labour market, fiscal support and savings built up during the pandemic."  so practically we are in deep shit but for the moment people keep on spending their savings over the pandemic... when savings are over, the inflation must be at target 2,3% or recession?|2022-06-09 06:51:25

br8iim|v8ddje|v8ddje|0|#Help a fellow retard lose money—how does RH's call credit collateral work?    Hey guys  Some background: on Monday, I purchased 28 Nov 16th 52.50 strike INTC calls for ~$2800. I figured that INTC had spent enough time wallowing, and was due for a recovery. (More reasons than this, just cutting the DD short).   Anyways, yesterday, Intel *fucking told everybody its next quarter would suck* (more-or-less) and my calls instantly halved in value. Thanks, cunts.   Guess I'm still retarded... and so is Intel.   Anyways, I figured I'd exploit my own unfathomable fucking stupidity by reversing myself—converting my calls into a call credit spread... Only to discover the joys of RH collateral requirements.  Can anybody give me a simple calculation (or ballpark calculation) for RH's collateral requirements? There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to what I can and cannot sell.|2022-06-09 12:40:39
