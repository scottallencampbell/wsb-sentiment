w0uf0k|cm9ky8|cm9ky8|214|Devaluation is the beginning of the real trade war.  The Yuan under 7 to the dollar was the line in the sand imo.  Once China crossed that it means they're willing to do anything to counter the tariffs including tanking their own and the global economy by exporting deflation.  The Chinese straight up are daring the Fed/ECB/BoJ to match them in a currency race to the bottom.  The ECB and BoJ will have no choice but to join by going multiple rounds of QE because their economies can easily be tipped into deflation and recession given how unstable their economies have been of late.  The Fed will be forced to respond because there's no way the US can keep inflation expectations above 1% if everybody else is in a currency war.  I don't think a recession in the next 12-24 months or a straight market crash is the base case scenario, but they're on the table now for the first time since December.  Still, I think we have to be defensive here; if you want to play the trend down, just keep in mind that once the Fed gives any indication (or the market believes it has forced the Fed's hand by falling far enough), we'll see a bottom in place.|2019-08-05 07:01:01

w1siek|cm9ky8|cm9ky8|13|I remember back in 2008 when shit was going south in the Fall and **everyone** seemed to know about it, people were freaking out.  A lot of people I knew at the time avoided making big purchases, basically saying ‚Äòcould be the Great Depression, I need my money‚Äô.  I worked at an auto plant at the time and it was pretty shitty all around.  I can only imagine how WSB would‚Äôve been back then.  Now even on days when SP500, NQ drops 3-4% (still small potatoes compared with the 8-9% drops that happened multiple times in late 2008) almost nobody I work with even cares.

Fed is going to have to indicate at some point that they'll save markets (hint: Fed proved in June-July that it will obey market pricing on rate cuts).  &#x200B;  We know the trade war is spiraling out of control.  The question is how far down can the market be pushed before the Fed's hand is forced and we get a rip off the bottom?  SPX 2850? SPX 2800? SPX 2750?  The answer is probably closer to 2850 than 2750 imo.  Fed showed its hand the past 2 months and Powell's bluff that this was only a singular rate cut "course correction" is not believable at all.  Fed may have to go 0.50 cut in September if trade war goes even more out of control and ECB/BoJ start cutting rates like mad to match Chinese devaluation.|2019-08-05 06:43:48

They could've let it drop a long time ago.  Also Trump has the power to devalue US currency if he wanted to (not a smart idea seeing as the global economy is heading towards recession). A rate cut won't do shit. He just wants someone to blame when the market tanks another 5% tomorrow.|2019-08-05 13:26:59

I can obviously be wrong here, but I don't see what the upside or downside surprise would be for Disney.  Their terrific movie output the past couple months is already accounted for, the theme parks are stable and doing well because of Star Wars.  The stock is already pricing in huge upside on Disney+ but that hasn't signed anybody up yet.  Once it does, if it's beating projections there, you can get big bumps upwards past $150+.|2019-08-05 09:24:24
