b8ka24|ebuh29|ebuh29|14|Once upon a time, when I was still an r/investing dumbfuck, I thought that stock picking was difficult, because you could only go long and thus had to pick the tickers that actually went up. Then I discovered shorting, and realized that you could make money when stocks went *down* as well.  Then I discovered options, and learned that you could make money regardless of how stocks moved. If they went up, you could make money. If they went up then down, you could make money. If they went down, you could make money. If they traded flat, you could make money. If they went up-ish but not too up, you could make money. It literally couldn‚Äôt go tits up, I thought. There‚Äôs literally no way you could lose money. No matter what a stock did, you could configure an options position to profit bigly from it.  But despite all these new ways to make money, I lose more money now than I have ever before. I also don‚Äôt even buy stonks anymore. I am truly a brain-damaged autistic fuck.|2019-12-17 14:49:07

Riding BAC 29 calls to Valhalla at some point when it closed out 28.60 smth. Riding APHA 6 puts to valhalla when it closed at 6.26 smth.  &#x200B;  Decided to load on shares since I could never time shit with options bought  500 shares of NVDA at 173 and sold at 182 and missed out on the entire run up.  &#x200B;  Felt FOMO and started to scalp vixy before october clash of TRUMp Xi was making good 3-5k some days with 100k position. Locked into uvixy sold it at a slight loss and entered VIXY right before QE announcement and Trump meeting. Lost around 5k right away but was too greedy to realize losses.  here I am still holding that bitch vixy with around 40k unrealized losses, getting fucked by contango every month and hoping for a little pullback just to sell this shit at around 15 now.

CEO will acquire debt to buy back. Retail has been selling into this bull run.  Passive etf is also pushing up the market because of etf chains. Fund manager will have less fund to spend as the market unwind and there are fewer payee into the system once jobless rate go below 150k/ month.  As soon as you see jobless rate below 150k for 2 months, buy puts with abandon.  Bear cake day will come.

Stock has fallen 30% overnight to around $2.60ish.  While I‚Äôll take a hit on the shares, that means my $2 puts I sold are still out of the money and expire in two weeks. Will likely print. My $7 sold calls will print. And my cheap $3 puts are now ITM and will print. It‚Äôs always nice to be lucky.|2019-12-17 07:59:33

b88pdb|ebuh29|ebuh29|3|Have 5x QQQ 220c expiring late Jan. QQQ is flat or down today but they‚Äôve actually gone up a bit.   Also holding my SPY 320 Jan 6th call.   And I have 0 urge to enter any other positions today.   Just gonna let these ride for a while and sit back and enjoy my week off.   First week off in 2 years. Nothing planned, mostly for mental health reasons, I just needed some time.   So I think I‚Äôve got plenty of time for these options to mature, I don‚Äôt have to frantically check them and see if they‚Äôre profitable, trying to time the top, etc. Nah, I‚Äômma let it gooo and see where I takes me.

b7rqa8|ebuh29|ebuh29|3|Ok, I've got a question about stops.  I was schooled a bit but I'm trying to understand specifically how this happened.  I was just playing around with options this morning, grabbed 38 contracts of something at 0.09 premium.  It wasn't much of anything, really.  Later, I added a limit and stop, with both a bit far out (0.18 and 0.01).  The plan was to adjust these in this morning once there was some movement.  It's the 0.01 stop that I've got questions about.  The asks were around 0.11, and the bids were around 0.05.  Suddenly, \*ding\*  "ORDER FILLED".  WTF?   Somehow my stop at 0.01 was triggered and my contracts were sold.  Originally, I assumed this was some low liquidity play where someone sold down to 0.01 to trigger my stop, then bought my contracts.  However, there is no volume on the way down and the only volume at 0.01 is my 38 contracts.  I could see that if the market mover dropped all the bids and sold one contract at 0.01, it'd trigger my stop and they could buy mine.  However, there is no other volume at 0.01.  So... how was the stop triggered?  Does a complete lack of bids trigger a stop?  &#x200B;  Edit: bids trigger stops.  Obvious in retrospect.  For some reason I was thinking actual transactions did.  The market mover pulled their bids for less than a second and only a low 0.01 bid was left, triggering my stop.  Ok.  Not too bad to learn that with $300 instead of something I actually cared about.|2019-12-17 09:50:45
