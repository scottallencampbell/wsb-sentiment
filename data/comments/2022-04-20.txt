Oil crisis.  &#x200B;  Bull Case: Fed hasn't actually turned the money printer off so Stonks go brrrrr.

5h5bbv|u7sysq|u7sysq|8|I love the pirating cycle that’s going on here.  Everyone pirated movies in the 2000’s and early 2010’s because of expensive cable packages and movie rentals.   Then Netflix showed up and you could not only rent but stream movies for $7.99 a month. The convenience outweighed the price for most people.   Now we’ve almost reverted back to the days of expensive cable packages. Instead of the convenience of Netflix having all the movies/shows. You now need Disney+, HBO, Hulu, and Amazon to have a similar selection as 2015 Netflix. Not to mention Netflix is increasing rates and limiting password sharing.   It’s now become more convenient to illegally stream again. I’ll be damned if I’m gonna pay $30+ a month on top of internet to have a decent movie selection.|2022-04-20 08:03:09

I think Netflix’s drop in subscribers is related to inflation induced cost cutting for consumers and not indicative of an overall decrease in social media (despite facebook’s drop in the prior quarter which is more related to it being an outdated boomer platform)  Position: 4/29 $40c  Average cost: $0.87 per contract|2022-04-20 09:45:18

You're up like 3000% from when you bought back when this was a real growth play. You just watched NFLX get chopped on half overnight because everyone knows a recession is coming and we're all just playing musical chairs right now with our shitcos that are trading at like 8000x multiples.   You see Elon running distraction all over the place like Skilling and Lay.  You're wondering if the music is about to stop. You're sweating an upcoming nuclear earnings miss with some BS about an AI bot that nobody is going to fall for.  You panic.  We could drop another 10% today before the bell. Just think about it.

My best shot is that people are hoping that the bottom is in with earnings coming up, but surely Netflix tanking almost 40% can't have signaled confidence in that mentality?

5hnope|u7sysq|u7sysq|4|i think part of why the market rallied was because of passive 401k flows and partly also because of autocallables.  Basically yields are so low in Japan and Korea, that an explosion of synthetic yield enhancing strategies occurred, namely a currency carry trade + a vol selling premium collecting strategy on US indexes to create a proxy bond which is the carry instrument.  All of this was providing artificial insurance provider for Vol, when that snaps back, say if the yen goes back down, it will create a big fucking unwind of risk assets. This is like XIV on crack.|2022-04-20 10:12:51

5hzfio|u7sysq|u7sysq|5|Netflix talk — what I don’t understand is why Netflix spends any amount of capital on creating their own movies. They not only popularized binging, but they are very good at it. They have solid multi season shows in their portfolio and clearly know what works. More so, seasoned shows promote usage and engagement which creates a switching cost for the consumer. Why the fuck they would get A list celebrities like DiCaprio and Streep to do one 2 hour movie is beyond me. Very few movies are rewatchable. Like I can re watch Ozark since it is dense and complex. I can only rewatch human centipede a few times before I think I may just have a weird fetish and stop watching due to my own self pity.|2022-04-20 11:28:39

Tesla will report an increased market share thanks to Covid closures...remind investors they are force laboring people at their "sleep on the floor here" plant...and make a small profit.   Then tesla bulls will prop up the value of the stock after having sold weekly Tesla puts and Far otm options.  This will hurt NIO/XPEV heavily, they will drop initially.  Then next week as Tesla gives ups its gains following the options expiries, we will get the sympathy slump as well.  4/29 NIO 17p  XPEV 22p at end of day.|2022-04-20 12:45:33

Their job will be to stabilize ARKK     Trump 2024: That is too far, even for me.     Oh and did i mention TSLA. They will generate bigger profits this quarter.

Their production rate is about 2000/day, 3 weeks would make that to about 42,000 cars that Tesla could’ve produced over the lockdown period. If we average it to $50k/car, that would mean they have lost a potential revenue of over $2 billion. I dont know their exact profit margins, but I suppose lost potential profit was large too. This 3-week lockdown period for them happened just around the beginning April, that’s just after their Q1 period so likely it wont affect Q1’s numbers too much given their delivery numbers. What could make Tsla drop AH today is likely their lowered guidance for next quarter or any unexpected warnings for forward headwinds.

Two new giga factories became operational in last couple of months, that would add a great deal to their forward guidance.  Why I am not buying calls? I tend to stay away from binary events, besides I am cash poor these days. Partly due to unexpected additional tax I had to pay this year due to an oversight on my part. Partly because I spend a big chunk of my gains from last year on my parents, so no regrets there whatsoever.|2022-04-20 12:26:27

5ijy1f|u7sysq|u7sysq|-1|Position: TWTR shares, TWTR 53 calls for Friday, TSLA 1250 call for Friday. I think TSLA & TWTR are bound together at this point. TSLA is going to blow their earnings estimate out of the water and go to at least 1100, hopefully 1200. Yes it's at 200 p/e already, but they are the first and dominant entrant in the emergent electric vehicle market, and no one else is close. Outstanding TSLA earnings will confirm Musk's capabilities as a builder-of-companies, TWTR shareholders & perhaps board will be impressed, and TWTR will rise closer to Musk's offer of 54. I value TWTR at $100 a share - too much American political discourse takes place onboard that social media platform to value it any less.  Full Disclosure: I am poor as fuck and just trying to scrape together the $1200 fucking dollars per month I need to stay in this rented motel room and not be a homeless combat veteran again. The Motel owner offered me a $900 discount on rent to be the motel's night security watchman 6 nights a week. It worked out to a salary of $6 per hour. So in effect I would be paying him $300/month for the privilege of being a live-in employee. Do you believe that shit? What a terrible offer. I offered to do the job for free rent plus $275 per month, only $10 per hour, a very reasonable offer I thought, but he declined. State of the Economy.|2022-04-20 13:40:20

5iwkge|u7sysq|u7sysq|1|Looking to hear your autist thoughts on this epiphany I just had regarding quick and easy gains.  I just had a quick 10% gain off a put in the last 10 minutes before close today on a stock that's announcing earnings after hours. Obviously nothing works 100% of the time, but it seems like most stocks will usually have a sell off at the very end of the day on the day before earnings announcement as there are a lot of people who like to avoid the risk of holding through earnings.  So, buying a put in the last 20 minutes of the day on a stock just before earnings, seems like good odds. Thoughts?|2022-04-20 15:01:41

5h8drb|u7sysq|u7sysq|-3|If TWTR wants to avoid a buyout and return to its ATHs, it needs to expand its revenue stream.  Since its only source of revenue is advertisement, this means finding new ways to sell ads.  Right now they seem reliant on in-feed ads and promoted tweets, but both methods are easily ignored and offer limited space in contrast to the content that users are interested in.  A solution would be to develop a new method that allows advertisers to buy in to a pool at different tiers of frequency from which an advertiser may be selected to randomly sponsor a popular tweet.  Imagine, you’ve (completely accidentally) wound up on a Twitter feed that is dedicated to furry porn.   You’re scrolling and see that Goodyear is sponsoring a tweet picturing an anthropomorphic fox who inexplicably has basketball-sized breasts and a pool-noodle-sized penis fucking an anthropomorphic seal who also inexplicably has basketball-sized breasts and a pool-noodle-sized penis.   Now, you’re suddenly thinking, *”I am overdue to get new tires.”*  Billion dollar idea in the right hands.  ^^\(Message ^^sponsored ^^by ^^Goodyear.)|2022-04-20 08:26:49

Buy tomorrow at 11:00pm pst 3. Can’t buy or sell throughout the three weeks. 4. Must be on NASDAQ or NYE 5. A $100,000 limit  The winner will be decided based on the amount of money they have at the end of the three weeks. Which stocks do I invest in to win?

It will be quite easy to get them to reach into their portfolio of remedies.     The revenue will pour in for years. And the stock should eventually reach $300 to $400, maybe 2024 or 2025.
