ya37rm|hs70w1|hs70w1|25|So, it would seem that the market wants to tank, but current administration wont let it. Billionaires know whats up and left. Bears to be honest, the dump will never come because this current administration wont let it. And Bulls, nothing will skyrocket to your expectation because we are currently in the middle of a pandemic.  Market manipulation is a bitch and this wealth gap is obviously getting a bit more fucked with billionaires throwing making huge profits off of this pandemic.   I guess my only word of advice is. Yes your life sucks right now, wage slave, etc. We all want that million but chances of that happening are slim. So take care of your mental health, walk away for a bit, and stop giving these fuckers your money. I wouldn't be surprised if the plan is to keep shit up by using our money as a way to do it.  Something is off, can't really tell what, but I've read too many suicidal posts on here. To quote my brother in law who has been trading for years "If these idiots want to throw their money away that's great for us, let's make it easier for them to do it". Little did he know, I too am one of those idiots.  SPY 350c 7/17|2020-07-16 13:45:33

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hsa7gn/spotify\_tendies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hsa7gn/spotify_tendies/)   Now,  listen closely. You know Spotify for music and audio. I understand that. But what just occurred to me is they're building the capability for JRE to transition over WITH VIDEO INCLUDED.  What does that mean?  It's not just "podcasts" that are coming to Spotify. VIDEO IS COMING TO SPOTIFY. And if they're building that capability into the platform, the possibilities are endless. Hell, they could stand to open streaming through the platform to the masses, effectively moving in on YouTube's market while operating under a more sustainable profit model (subscription as opposed to advertisements).  All in shares + 10/16 $340c   Fuck you guys, you're welcome.|2020-07-16 13:54:02

yabo7p|hs70w1|hs70w1|30|One last time just because I feel bad for the new traders being all doe eyed and optimistic:   #DO NOT HOLD ANY NFLX OPTIONS OVERNIGHT (UNLESS THEY ARE SPREADS)  #NFLX options (both calls and puts) have 200% IV and are pricing in a 10% move in either direction. If the underlying does not move up or down by at least 5-7% in the RIGHT direction, you're going to get brutally IV crushed. For example, if NFLX only moves up by 2% your calls will lose at least 50% in value. So if you insist on holding pray hard it gaps up or down 7% so that you can make at least a little pittance.|2020-07-16 14:55:12

They are boomers and have some cash tied up in markets for retirement but me and my brother have gotten them to diversify enough so that they’ll be fine regardless of what happens.   I explained how people are saying there’s a bubble and then spoke about TSLA for a bit etc. My dad then says “yeah they are pumping it up so that the big guys can sell out at the top and leave the little guys holding the bag.” My dad did not graduate college and is not well versed in financial markets...  It just leaves me with one question. Dad, are you here?     Are you a wsb autist? Like father like son if so......|2020-07-16 08:49:30

ya9jp7|hs70w1|hs70w1|26|I'm going to scream this for the last fucking time.   #DO NOT HOLD ANY NFLX OPTIONS OVERNIGHT (UNLESS THEY ARE SPREADS)  #NFLX options (both calls and puts) have 200% IV and are pricing in a 10% move in either direction. If the underlying does not move up or down by at least 5-7% in the RIGHT direction, you're going to get brutally IV crushed. For example, even if NFLX moves up by 2% your calls will lose at least 50% in value.|2020-07-16 14:38:08

Better to throw your money into a brokerage account and buy some multi-colored ETF than leaving your cash in a 0.001% APR savings account.   Banks don't need customer's cash anymore, they can get paid to borrow cash with negative yields. Shit banks should just take trillions in negative-yielding bonds or treasuries and get that paid billions from the negative 0.25% interest. Can't go tits up, the central banks want the business banks to take trillions from them and spend it and are willing to pay them to do so. Big brain move, take the money and don't spend it, just hold it and collect the interest and then you'll have trillions to deploy when the economy doesn't recover precisely because they haven't been spending that cash.|2020-07-16 08:58:22

IV is at 200% and it is pricing in an almost 10% swing in either direction. If NFLX does not go up or down by at least 5-6% after earnings, you will get brutally IV crushed.

They have been working you, allowing your tiny little trades to accumulate by the masses to help lift their massive portfolios.

There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.  You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.  “Red” you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.  You see the confused expression on Big Jay’s face as he spins the wheel. “Black” he calls with a sigh.  “This game is fucking RIGGED!” you shout with fury|2020-07-16 08:50:38

y8uhea|hs70w1|hs70w1|7|Today is likely a red day.. which means buying day.  My suggestion is CVS.  Rite Aid smoked earnings and spiked.  Walgreen's had horrible earnings, but attributed the slip to their U.K. business. Their U.S. business was strong they said (without specifics).  CVS is not exposed to non-US markets, and is Rite Aid on roids. Those shelves have been empty for quite some time, not to mention the pharmacy and health-forward play. Earnings are on August 5th... so wait for the dip today for the calls to be on sale and stock up on 65C and 70C for 8/21.|2020-07-16 07:14:36

y8vmi8|hs70w1|hs70w1|7|> Thursday’s moves came following a major sell-off in mainland Chinese stocks, which saw the Shanghai composite down more than 4% on the day.

y97nei|hs70w1|hs70w1|7|Best investment plan moving forward. Buy a house. Lock in that 3% 30 year APR on as many houses as you can. Banks will never charge less than 3% because they've got to make some money off the loan. With all the cash the FEDs are giving the banks, banks will want to make as many loans as possible. Even if people can't pay their mortgages, banks won't have actually made a loss, and if somehow becomes a problem for their balance sheets, homeowners will simply bail out the banks again.   30 Years from now, all those houses you bought gonna be worth a fuck ton more. And you'll never have a problem finding renters because poor people got that shitty credit so bank's won't loan to them, especially since banks have been tag-teamed DODD-FRANK.

I’m confused about how they think they can possibly protect their guests and their employees.”  “I certainly know people who work there who are very uncomfortable, who have conditions like asthma and diabetes that put you at high risk, who are literally deciding whether they want to go back to work or buy food."

The call will be exercised tomorrow, but overall I will be back in cash with more returns than had I done only the put.   Fine results from a theta point of view...so far.

y9ns8q|hs70w1|hs70w1|3|So this all hangs on NFLX earnings reviving QQQ huh? Man, I'm balls deep in tech calls, about 40k worth (was 40k lmfaooooo).    Although I am optimistic about earnings for most of the big boys, I don't see good news for NFLX. Tbh, the market was already so saturated for them. But they did at 12m new subs last quarter so who knows?    On the flip side, I did end up getting prime and Disney plus because I got bored with Netflix, which I've had for years. And I know a lot of people that did, so earnings might be better for other folks. People didn't stop spending money, they just stopped spending it on restaurants, alcohol, and gas. That money has to be going into some other company's pockets. Sure savings went up but disproportionally compared to how much they'd save not going out. People are burning cash and I'd say it's safe to bet companies in the QQQ might be getting it.      Is this a DD? Lmfao. Good luck my autists and retards.

If that sounds like how you feel, maybe pull out for now and focus on you. Always take care of yourself first, money comes second.

y8uwxd|hs70w1|hs70w1|6|Took a trip to the Gigafactory yesterday around 6pm as a meme because I was bored and wanted my calls to print. There was the longest line of employees leaving in their cars that I’ve ever seen. Maybe it’s crazy, but it was somehow reassuring for the bull case during earnings. I know the stock is getting beaten down now but I think next week will surprise. [pic from my pilgrimage ](https://ibb.co/nwXwWcK)|2020-07-16 07:19:54

y909ka|hs70w1|hs70w1|5|Something for you to know,   All of the construction/manufacturing industry is having issues with lack of work. Some are doing very well and demand is high. In general the employees that have been called to work are repeatedly being sent home and back to unemployment on a week to week or even day by day basis.   Our company is large and travels the entire US. We have been limited on work and 87% of our work force is still laid off. And we barley have enough work along the east coast.   Just something to think about. It worries all of us that companies will want to permanently move employees to work from home. Which means less commercial work. Which hurts lots of jobs. Take a second and create a scenario of where a majority of companies and the labor force are no longer needed.   This is my opinion and take it as such. I do not like it, it sucks. I love my job.|2020-07-16 08:18:19

I am not going to give up yet as I see more investment in this area and I want to hear what they have to say during the upcoming earnings call.  SBUX has bounced between 72 and 75 for while now.  I have decided not to trade and stick it out in the name.    AZN has come back and my calls are in the green.  I was hoping it would hold 60 where it was trading in pre-market.

y8yy91|hs70w1|hs70w1|2|Imagine you were going to buy a new car. Your budget is 25,000 or so… you want something nice, Back in the day the core argument against Tesla was range and the convenience of repair. It was hard to counter these arguments because there weren’t that many people on the road driving teslas. Now, you see them absolutely everywhere, it’s easy to find someone to talk to about it, the range issue is not prohibitive. Repair is not prohibitive. And there are so many articles out there showing the cost of ownership is highly competitive with Kahrs $10,000 less in the long run. Even the older boomers that I know are onto this. Why would you pay sticker price For a gas vehicle when for an equivalent net long-term cost you could get a literal spaceship?

y9utfx|hs70w1|hs70w1|2|Do you think Amazon will buy Macys? I do and here's why. About 18 mos. ago, Macys told all their NYC corporate employees that they were moving out of the Manhattan offices (some in Herald Square store and some a few blocks up) that they were moving to offices in Long Island City. It was really unexpected and not good at all for all the buyers and planners bc it would add at least 30 minutes to their commutes. LIC is a nightmare to get to especially for the majority that came from NJ. Some theorized that Amazon maybe wanted to acquire them. In the meantime, NYC screwed AZN out of the LIC move by them so all this ended up moot. I think it's going to happen. I did way back before corona and now, I seriously do. The herald square property is HUGE and centrally located. There is no way that they don't have a NYC HQ of some sort like Google and the other big guys.|2020-07-16 12:38:28

y97p1r|hs70w1|hs70w1|1|Who can explain. I bought NCNO IPO at the open yesterday for $71. It went to $94 and now is down to $69. I am assuming based on the volume that almost all the people who got in at the IPO price of $31 sold it already which means most of the buyers got in at $71 or higher price.  My question is why is stock below $70 since most of us bought it $71 or higher price. Are people taking loss?|2020-07-16 09:29:24

Clover has initiated a Phase I clinical study assessing the potential of combining its COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine (SCB-2019) with GSK's pandemic adjuvant system, which can reduce the amount of protein required per vaccine dose.  The moves rides on the back of promising preclinical data indicating the beneficial effect of GSK's pandemic adjuvant for the SCB-2019 vaccine candidate, “with high neutralising antibody levels elicited in multiple animal species,” the UK drug giant noted.  Preliminary safety and immunogenicity results for the Phase I study are expected in August, while planning for a global Phase IIb/III vaccine efficacy trial has already begun, with initiation scheduled  for later this year.|2020-07-16 07:20:30

ya5v6k|hs70w1|hs70w1|-13|Maybe unpopular opinion, but hear me out - stimulus checks are fuckin retarded. $1200 does nothing for most adults and depending on where you are, you can't even pay for a studio apartment. It's a huge waste of money for something you can't even call a bandaid. It would be much better to use the money on creating jobs or something.    edit: lol at these downvotes, y'all live in some bumfuck rural places or something?|2020-07-16 14:07:18
