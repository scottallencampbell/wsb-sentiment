hxxvxw|f577wz|f577wz|6|Here's some DD my dudes. Take it however you want.  SmileDirectClub (SDC) was down 17% on Friday after NBC News released a hit piece on them. I bought calls. I'm a very happy SDC customer and used their product for 6 months. They were extremely transparent with what I should expect from their product and they even created 3D mockups of what my teeth would look like.. I paid the $2k upfront. They turned out exactly as they said it would.   Here's an excerpt from the response of SDC CEO ((full article here)[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smile-direct-club-turns-up-the-heat-on-nbc-news-investigative-report-235611025.html]):   NBC News‚Äô story triggered a fierce response by SmileDirectClub Chairman and CEO David Katzman.  ‚ÄúNBC Nightly News ran an incredibly one-sided and distorted report on SmileDirectClub. Given the way in which it portrayed the company, I want to address this story directly. We cannot stand for one-sided, biased journalism that stems from a coordinated attack by trade organizations to limit our success. We also won‚Äôt stand by when efforts are being made to limit consumers‚Äô ability to have a real alternative in getting a safe and affordable smile they deserve,‚Äù  I find what NBC did as a blatant attack just a week before earnings. I'm bullish. We'll have to see what the numbers say on the 25th.|2020-02-17 12:36:12

hxii74|f577wz|f577wz|4|(Kitco News) - A quiet start to the week is weighing on gold prices, but analysts remain optimistic that prices can push higher as easing from the People‚Äôs Bank of China could ignite a further drop in global interest rates.  Overnight, the PBOC the interest rate on its medium term loans in an attempt to counteract the economic hit from the growing coronavirus. However, the move has had little impact on gold prices as major North American markets are closed for holidays Monday. Spot gold prices on Kitco.com last traded at $1,581.40 an ounce, down 0.14% on the day.    Despite the weak price action Monday, many analysts are expecting that the PBOC‚Äôs latest move will continue to support the yellow metal.   Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said that economists are still trying to estimate the full impact the spreading virus will have on the global economy. He added that this uncertainty will continue to support gold prices.  ‚ÄúWe have seen monumental demand destruction this past month and that won‚Äôt be resolved anytime soon,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCentral banks will be forced to ease again, but the question is just how much impact further easing will have.‚Äù  Looking at China‚Äôs economy, Bank of Montreal economists said that they have lowered their growth forecasts and expect China‚Äôs GDP to grow 5.25% this year.  ‚ÄúGiven that China now accounts for just under 20% of global GDP, that downgrade translates‚Ä¶ to a 0.2% cut to global economic growth,‚Äù the analysts said.  Afshin Nabavi, head of trading with MKS (Switzerland) SA, said that it is only a matter of time before gold prices push above $1,600 an ounce as growth fears continue to support investment demand.  Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that investors will get a better understanding of the Fed‚Äôs position on monetary policy following the release of the minutes from the January monetary policy meeting.  ‚ÄúWhether Chair Powell‚Äôs warning about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the US economy will potentially justify a further cut in interest rates remains to be seen, with speculators already pricing in a 43% chance of a rate cut by mid-year,‚Äù he said.  Although gold has room to move higher because of growing coronavirus fears, Hansen said that the precious metal still faces a significant hurdle: a saturated marketplace.  ‚ÄúThere has been a lot of buying lately, but prices haven‚Äôt really gone anywhere,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight now, there is no reason to sell your gold, but there are not a lot of new reasons to buy if we don‚Äôt see any new price action.‚Äù  By Neils Christensen|2020-02-17 09:59:13

Rainbow bears may have their picnic this time next month if the force majeure clause is used.  Spring sucks, puts on the menu.

Only alternative if somehow China imports metric shit tonnage to meet their new level requirements in the deal, but even as a permabull, I don't see it.
