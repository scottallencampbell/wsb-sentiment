5d947u|u71hzz|u71hzz|9|When the fed buys treasuries for its balance sheet, bond prices rise because of demand meaning the yields drop. This is an element of QE and when yields drop investors want their money in equities where they can get greater returns. Hence the insane bull run past couple years. Now the opposite happens - as QT takes place and bond prices drop as fed unwinds, yields rise (as you can see the insane rise the past month) and will attract investors looking for safety amongst tumultuous equity markets. Sure your 5 figure portfolio-eeeher who cares about 3% yield gay lame and boring- won’t matter to you. But funds who manage tens of billions of dollars of client money, they will care just a little bit.|2022-04-19 12:23:33

5d1fjx|u71hzz|u71hzz|4|If 2018 is any guide, the Fed can hike to about 2.5% before the economy collapses.   IMO, they will run it up towards that, the economy will choke into stagflation, then Powell has a hard choice to make. He's been putting it off as long as possible. He's either going to have to start off a decade long plan of high rates and austerity, or continue to increase currency debasement into a default.  The US has proven time and again - Rona, Afghanistan, public schools, you name it - that they have no backbone to make hard decisions and just prefer to throw money at problems.

5d1hyg|u71hzz|u71hzz|4|Amazon: What are the odds that this low margin whale disappoints next Thursday, blaming it all on inflation and unions, and then gets dumped big time?  With brands figuring out their own webstore experience, private sellers flooding the webstore with direct imports from Asia (those brand names) and the search results and filter options being terrible, shopping on Amazon is miserable.  Prime is a holdup on shipping costs. Do you use any of their other services?  Then, they have the surging costs for logistics, fuel and mapower.  On top, there's the RIVN gamble. A massive writeoff on those holdings will be inevitable.  As for AWS, I simply don't like it. There were all the outages. MSFT has reached parity on fees and the service is better. But then again, I am heavily biased because administration and cost control is a nightmare, their service team has dicked me too many times.  Please help me changing my mind before I dump too much money on those May 2900 puts.|2022-04-19 11:35:18

5csner|u71hzz|u71hzz|2|So, if the biggest EU consumers of oil refuse to stop buying Russian oil, but we impose embargos, we end up just paying a premium for the same oil from trade partners for no reason. Everyone wants to denounce Russia but nobody wants to make the hard decisions that will actually halt their progress. Way to show your fucking hand, Europe. Especially Germany. Supply is still severely constrained, but the EU is going to cave and things will go back to business as usual. Not sure how this will play out with oil prices. The trend is still up over a longer timeframe, but if it becomes open season again they'll drop pretty hard because Russia has a war to fund. They'll be the ones to make the rest of OPEC+ take their profits. Either way, I'm probably too early for puts on USO, but keep an eye on the news.|2022-04-19 10:38:39

5dygx3|u71hzz|u71hzz|3|Put holders: I personally can't see the path forward for NFLX as a company, considering the crushing competition, but have in mind that data analytics platforms are showing that the company had a strong q1 start and new subscribers might come at 4 mil. plus, while projections are for 2.5 mil. Considering the fact that the stock is already beaten down, lotto puts might be riskier than you think. Good luck.|2022-04-19 14:59:44

5c6vj1|u71hzz|u71hzz|1|I'd like to know how Netflix charging people for sharing their accounts would be a selling tactic. Sharing media has been a thing for the longest time, and now you're telling people they have to pay extra just to share it with other people?  How do you even quantify that? Can't people just invite people over to their house? Unless they're talking about accessing accounts from different locations? That requires some kind of tracking and sounds kind of stalkerish but okay.|2022-04-19 08:11:31

5ca5ui|u71hzz|u71hzz|1|weird how everyone is talking about inflation but the dollar is up 8% since october and 10% since june. almost like higher prices aren't due to inflation. did you know CPI is a measure of the price of goods independent of actual dollar supply? higher prices don't technically mean 'inflation' due to 'money printing'.  riddle me this. if banks are selling all their treasuries to the fed and know that QE causes inflation, then why would they want to do this and hold onto enormous amounts of cash that they earn less in overnight reverse repo than they 'lose' to 'inflation'? why are foreign countries selling their US treasuries for cash if they know they're going to lose purchasing power on the cash they're getting?|2022-04-19 08:35:56
