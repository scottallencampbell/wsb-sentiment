So while we're approaching 357 keep in mind that that's the 52W low point and we're likely to test it and bounce. Come back down, break through it , and bounce again before settling back around 357.  We may drop through and the whole word finally accepts the crash and capitulation hits but that's incredibly unlikely. So if you're not playing a small position that you're ready to lose your best place to sell is on the initial test of the 52W low just before 357. 357.25 or somewhere like that will let you capture the best IV on your 345 puts for this Friday that I'm sure you have.

It’s on every subreddit, idiots suggesting giving Ukraine cruise missiles, NATO imposing a no fly zone, US to bomb Russian bases etc. All of them parrot the same tired line that “Russia’s nukes probably don’t work anyway!”  The US has literally physically inspected Russia’s nukes as part of nuclear treaties. Russia has literally tested and manufactured more nukes than even we have. Just because they have shit tanks and suck at conventional war doesn’t mean their nukes don’t work. In fact, the fact that they do have such a strong nuclear program is arguably part of the reason they stopped caring about their conventional warfare capabilities.  Really scary to see a total lack of concern for nuclear war.

No, you don't have get Hollywood levels of jacked; you want to be presentable and attractive to other women too, because being desirable is a turn-on. * There is a level of attraction formed through emotional bonding and love that you can't get from a club skank one night stand. * Don't expect them to not get upset at your regarded gambling if that's all you're doing. You wouldn't want to be with a woman that runs up enormous credit card bills she can't pay. * Actually focus on making her happy, because she will focus on your happiness too. Give back what you want to receive. * Women, no matter what they say, love a more traditional relationship. Take out the trash, watch a YouTube tutorial on how to change the oil in your car, etc. * You will have to grow some balls and be responsible. Stop giving excuses. Do your job as a man and do the things you have to even if you don't like it. She'll look up to you and you won't even have to ask for dat poon; she'll just give it to you.

Nowhere (that I saw or read) has he said that what they are doing now is a mistake. In fact just the opposite. He is just pointing out the obvious. The fix for the first two mistakes is a sharp recession that cannot be avoided. Most y'all think he is arguing for a Pivot.  Tis stuff like this why most of you lose money. Click bait headlines inform your world. Use your head and play the market in front of you. It will be obvious when the FED will pivot AND when a more lasting bottom is in. Neither is known now.

No end in sight to this conflict at the moment, so all supply line related issues will persist. * Fed members emphasize that inflation is persistent and that there is too much employment. The target rate is now expected to be **above** 4.5% in 2023 (up from previous 4.25% consensus). * Rates go up, stocks go down. Stocks do not go up until rates stop going up.  Dear, soon to be departed, bulls. Repeat after me:  Valuations will continue to adjust \[downward\] until rates stop going up. Higher rates directly correlate to lower stock prices.  China & war related supply issues are continuing. Until there is an improvement in this **regard**, then the only path forward is curbing demand by reducing the money **you** \[the consumer\] have.
