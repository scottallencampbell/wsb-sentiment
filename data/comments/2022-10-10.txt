nmf4no|rawn4n|rawn4n|8|Fed retired “transitory” to create perception of persistent inflation to encourage spending, when in fact inflation is dying down. Fed can’t create inflation except by lowering interest rates which are already at zero. Quantitive easing is deflationary because the money is held in FED accounts and does not actually enter the real economy (it is illegal for the FED to simply print and inject money). Debt spending by congress, stimulus, BBB, etc, only generates transitory inflation until the debt catches up; the effect is only beneficial for 3-5 months.|2021-12-07 12:36:33

No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me?

That bodes well for the next week which is when the rubber meets the road on inflation.  Market is much healthier right now with substantial knockdown on some tech P/E ratios than it was last month.  A lot of money moved into semiconductors, cyclicals, etc. and out of the Covid speculation plays and a lot of cloud names got docked 25-40%.  Small caps/high growth multiples came down substantially.  Honestly hard to forecast what will happen with this Fed meeting, but market positioning looks way better than early November.|2021-12-07 12:07:45

Don’t want too much of it so I think another PMCC on it and grow it to 200 shares would be the play here. Easy $60 of premium per week there. Nice kicker is that it’ll cost me the same amount to start on it like $JPM, $4.5k for 2 deep ITM LEAPS.  Dream is to own 100 shares of $AMZN but shits too fucking expensive.

nmsd8s|rawn4n|rawn4n|3|This might be the warning rally because we quickly got back up to near $470 again for the 4th or 5th time, and every time we touch or go past it it does not hold at or above $470 for long and drops every time, either by the market or conveniently times news.  Anyone buying calls unless you're day trading is a fool. At least on SPY.   BTW, notice during this jump up days recently QQQ was not leading as usual and the tech stocks aren't really doing as well? The stocks responsible for 90% of the stock market rally since March last year? Yet the yields got shattered the last week and a half?  Hmm, printer is outdated it seems, can't print quality anymore. Powell about to announce its decommission.   Of course most here will ignore this and buy calls that will end up worthless.

Even the "experts" who kept under predicting them and claiming it was transitory while I kept insisting they were full of shit, think the numbers will be 6.7%. Insanely high. Fed will have to quickly accommodate. Taper tantrum followed by quick interest rate hikes. There is 0% chance we don't crash before end of 2022 and it'll be massive when it happens. 50%+ across the board. So take your wins and your $10 Robinhood accounts and buy a gumball, because the party is going to be over very soon. Do not stay in this market if you want to keep those profits.

The volume in 2008 reached 800 million on some SPY trading days during the crash. Until we see a huge uptick in volume, especially in today's trading era, ain't no crash. But you bet your ass it's coming. Over 50% across the board and it'll happen before year end 2022 now that Fed is forced to remove support and combat inflation. Fridays CPI#s could be big.

nlkrkx|rawn4n|rawn4n|-8|LWLG has invented a customizable family of electro-optic polymers that have been engineered and designed into photonic devices called modulators. These next-generation modulators will replace today’s modulators that are made with expensive inorganic materials that no longer are able to scale up in speed and efficiency and consume massive amounts of power. LWLG polymer enabled modulators are 3x faster than today’s technology and require less than half the power to operate. In fact, these modulators are so “low power” that they eliminate the need for a driver on a chip which is an expensive and power hungry component.  Modulators are the backbone of the Internet whereby they are the primary active component within transceivers that switches the 1’s and 0’s of data via light.  While the stock has increased significantly during 2021, it is anticipated that another massive run will occur within 12 months as their commercialization partners are made public and the technology becomes available to purchase. For several years, LWLG has been working with numerous Tier 1 companies under NDA and have a packaging partner who has assisted in developing their product based on their customer input. Earlier this year in May at the company’s annual shareholders meeting, LWLG finally revealed their commercialization plan which brought on new investor interest.  LWLG’s proprietary polymer modulators will be integrated into silicon photonics foundries’ “menu” of options for chipmakers. It will be a natural and easy choice for transceiver makers to choose the fastest and most efficient modulator available. Modulators are not only found in data center interconnects and transceivers, but also they are found in any device that processes data with light such as LIDAR for cars and medical sensing devices. Without a question, the addressable market is in the billions of dollars annually.  Today data centers consume likely 5% of the world’s electricity. The value of drastically reducing the energy cost via LWLG enabled modulators is quite valuable in itself.  The CEO of the company, Dr. Michael Lebby, is one of the top minds and visionaries in the field of Photonics. He has spearheaded global industry efforts to collaborate and standardize photonics technologies. He recently has starting using the term “ubiquitous” when describing how Lightwave Logic’s technology will fit in.  NASDAQ listed with only 110 million shares outstanding. Over a year’s worth of operating capital in the bank and recently announced an additional $33 million financing to ramp up commercialization efforts with very minimal dilution.  I like the stock.|2021-12-07 08:54:59
