gtgpbg|kir3c3|kir3c3|29|Here is the deal with PLTR, and you can apply this to any tech related stock that isnt feeling the breakout.      Traditional VC finance regarding tech is bullshit and hasn't caught up to truth that even though a company, like PLTR, isn't "profitable" (as in their balance sheet doesn't show a positive cashflow over expenses) then creditors and rating groups like "shitron" or "credit suisee" will always be bearish on it.     Profitability is obviously very fucking important, but by the time you hop into a tech company that reported their first hard profitable quarter, the stock has already taken off.   Amazon, Tesla, Apple = all these companies were in the the red FOR YEARS. Amazon had serious issues gaining traction getting VC funding because despite experiencing strong growth and a stronger pull to profitability VCs discounted it "bECauSe iT wAsN't pRofiTaBle" because they forgot that as a company invests in its infrastructure, they streamline and become more viable.  Look at what happened to Tesla, Every VC saw their product. Despite some production flaws, a Tesla vehicle has the highest consumer approval rating in the automotive industry. They had 1 profitable quarter and the price fucking flew from 189 share price to 645.   Palantir has been around for a while, no argument about that. But the reason why they IPO'd so recently isn't a coincidence, they are becoming more and more profitable as quarters come by at a dramatic pace. This is especially true because they produce SOFTWARE. They have an insanely high market opportunity to grow into.   Don't sleep on it|2020-12-23 12:12:42

gtw18e|kir3c3|kir3c3|22|I honestly don't understand the 1B market cap rule. Under 500M makes more sense. Even GME was 500M marketcap a few months ago...  I called CIIC and THCB at $10 - 11, you can't even pump and dump a SPAC (bottom is $10). I couldn't post a lot of good DD because of that rule (FYI, I got in R M G, P I C (XL) at $10)  Also called M A R A when it was $4 in a comment but it was under 1B  &#x200B;  Anyway, **congrats to whoever followed my CIIC and THCB posts,** holding warrants back to back will net you over 1500% return without needing risky options.|2020-12-23 14:26:40

gt215a|kir3c3|kir3c3|14|How I actually make money buying and selling calls without having $25k:  - Buy calls when stocks dip 5-10% in a day, never buy a stock that was up 5-10% in a day unless incredibly bullish news comes out (I.e. when Tesla was announced to be added to S&P) - either sell your calls right at open or don’t look at your stocks for the first 15 minutes before selling. Don’t flip flop or you’ll end up paper handing literally everything. Make up your mind and stay consistent. - buy calls towards the EOD unless you’re confident a stock will rise all day, which rarely happens. (This is more for people who don’t have $25k and cannot day trade all day) - don’t get caught bagging on IV crushing days. - EDIT: buy calls 1 month out, and don’t sell on the first day you have a red day.|2020-12-23 10:04:56

gt8hjc|kir3c3|kir3c3|11|I see lots of brothers crying over CRSR, so I am going to shine light on it.  1. CRSR have no marketing team, they literally do not give a singular fuck about how their stocks do since IPO because of the busy holiday season.  2. It is a long hold, their current price it undervalued because no news are generated for the boomers and you know boomers can't read anything tech related. Boomers don't care about what it does or what future it has, only whether it will generate money or not.  >[And while Corsair has been losing money on all of these businesses over the last couple of years — a $13.7M loss in 2018 and an $8.4M loss in 2019 — it seems that COVID-19 has been good to Corsair. The company saw a $23.8M profit between January and June 2020 alone.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21398656/corsair-ipo-billion-dollar-revenue-profit-coronavirus-shelter)  Covid recovered all their losses within 6 months, people are staying home and upgrading their stuff so they won't be working with a fucking windows XP computer or shitty laptop from home. 18% market share and 42% of gaming peripherals? Oh it's ThE vErGe so it's not reputable???  Straight from their S1 filing:  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm  >Leverage our software platforms to sell more gear to existing customers. Our software platforms integrate and enhance our ecosystem of gaming and streaming gear, which drives customer loyalty and allows us to successfully sell additional gear to existing customers.  	 	 >**Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales.** Through our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF in 2019, we acquired two companies whose sales are primarily generated through direct-to-consumer channels. While sales from this channel are a relatively small contributor to our revenue today, we believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories.  >**Continue to grow market share globally**. As a globally recognized brand, we have a footprint that reaches customers in more than 75 countries. We will continue to invest in enhancing our sales and distribution infrastructure to expand our leadership position in the Americas and Europe. In the gaming peripherals market, we have increased our U.S. market share from 5.0% in December 2013 to 18.3% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis according to NPD Group. We are a clear market leader in the gaming PC components market. According to NPD Group, we have increased our U.S. market share from 26.2% in December 2015 to 41.9% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis. Additionally, for the twelve months ended June 2020, **we had number one U.S. market share in gaming computer cases with a 18% market share, cooling solutions with a 53% market share, PSUs with a 42% market share and high-performance memory with a 54% market share.** **We view the Asia Pacific region as a long-term growth opportunity and recently invested in our local sales force and regional management to build out distributor networks and retail partnerships.**  >**Selectively pursue complementary acquisitions.** **We plan to evaluate, and may pursue acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Elgato, Origin and SCUF,** which we believe strengthen our capabilities in existing segments as well as diversify our product offerings, broaden our end-user base or expand our geographic presence.

If the president doesn’t sign or veto the bill within 10 days after it is passed, it would become law without his signature. If he does reject the bill, Congress could still vote to override his veto.  WSJ  So even if he vetoes the bill Congress can still send it through.

gt6ffi|kir3c3|kir3c3|16|If you want to play GME, buy fucking shares you idiots. Stop buying options. You will most likely lose you premium and even if it works out, when you sell you are only providing cover for shorts. If you buy calls, only buy them to exercise and remove more shares from the market. This shouldn’t be a difficult concept. It’s basic supply and demand. Less shares in the market, the higher the price. The higher the price the more financial incentive shorts have to cover this further driving up the price.

gtjvb1|kir3c3|kir3c3|4|not an update but just an fyi:  It doesn't matter that stimulus/covid passed with a veto-proof majority because Trump can pocket veto this because Congress took too long.  It doesn't matter that the NDAA passed with a veto-proof majority because McCarthy/the House and GOP Senators have said they will sustain, not override his veto.    It's starting to come out today but if you've been following me since last week - it looks like Trump really is pissed enough at McConnell to tank any of the three bills to get section 230.

Still betting that it's oversold, regardless of their launch issues and bugs, even non gamers I know are buying it, still think it's gonna remain THE game peolpe will at least try out.   We'll see, could obviously be totally wrong about them  I think another issue for them is lack of supply of PS5/Xbox  This should be resolved in next couple of months, and still think this will remain the number 1 game people will want to buy and play as they upgrade to the newest console.

Needless to say they are ITM now, about a week out from expiration.  So, worst case, I get assigned at 18, make a couple hundred plus the premium.  Not a loss, but I'd like to see how much further this could go.    Should I just assume it will get assigned on 12/31 if it's still ITM?  How likely is it that it could get assigned sooner than that?  Who makes that decision?  I assume the market maker, rather than some other random retail investor?|2020-12-23 09:40:14

Shares closed at $131.67, up another 39% after rallying 29% on Monday. The numbers are, to say the least, incredible.  Shares of the electric vehicle battery company have gained almost 80% this week and about 593% over the past three months.

gsolkp|kir3c3|kir3c3|2| Hey guys, I stumbled upon ARKO which is listing today on NASDAQ. They were listed on the Isreal stock exchange at approx. 70$ USD and delisted from that to merge with Haymaker Acquisition corp and G.P.M investments and is now listing at 10$. They are the 7th largest convenience chain I believe and had a Ebitda of approx. 150m as of Q3 2020. If anyone has any additional information please comment. I am planning on getting some today since it seems like it should go back up to 70$ from changing markets? Am I missing something?|2020-12-23 07:51:14

I’m still all in however once the NASDAQ touches 13K I’m trading my CALLS 4 PUTS. (Yesterday the NASDAQ touched 12,840 meaning we’re just 160 points away and futures are up.   WHY?   So for in 2020 every time the NASDAQ touches a new 1K milestone; 10K, 11K, 12K etc it has corrected 3-5% within the next couple of days (it may close over that marker and even go up more for a day there after however then gravity hits)   -9K; May 8th: went over 9K (fell for the next 3 days approx 3.5% and took 5 trading days to get back on track).   -10K; June 10th: touched 10K (June 11th fell over 5% and took over 7 trading days to touch 10K once again. Then for the next month traded sideways high 9K low 10K   -11K; Aug 8th touched 11K and the following 3 days went down (over 3%)   -12K; Sep 2nd; touched 12K following 3 days down over 12% didn’t touch 12K again until Nov. 24th   Don’t be a tard and cash some of your profits. You can get back in at a much better price.  Edit: dont believe? Check how SPY was doing on those dates. This is a pattern|2020-12-23 09:55:51

Mango might veto it, but it has a veto-proof majority. He has until today to veto. If he does, then the veto is overturned on Friday. All that to say that the defense spending bill will be passed. It obviously budgets money to be spent on defense and therefore companies who provide things for our defense.   I’m thinking that defense companies like Lockheed will pop once the bill is passed. Am I thinking correctly here? Defense stocks DEFINITELY don’t look like they have anything priced in, they have dropped recently.  Would I be wrong to expect a spike in LMT, LDOS, etc?  Thoughts?

gto7w4|kir3c3|kir3c3|2|AAPL EV is good for Tesla  **Unless any of you guys think that another electric vehicle company is going to be able to produce higher quality cars at a lower cost than Tesla which I think is exceedingly unlikely, then all news of competitor electric vehicles should be treated as a positive. Here’s why: **  For Tesla, **Dominating the electric vehicle market right now is far less important than hastening the transition to an electric automotive market.** Every electric vehicle that comes out , Especially if an Apple vehicle comes out, normalizes the concept and reality of electric vehicles for the American consumer. It makes them more comfortable with it. Big brand names with consumer trust like the legacy auto manufacturers and Apple instill confidence in electric vehicle purchases for the average American.    **Therefore, if tesla can retain the edge and remain the best electric vehicle manufactured at the lowest price, they stand up from facilitated American adoption of electrical transport.**  Currently, tesla enjoys that very same status. Tesla reigns supreme within the electric vehicle sector right now. I think that is likely to stay…   - The manufacturing advances they are making with the model Y (casting machine) and the cybertruck, (folding chassis) and The new battery design, which is designed in order to enable very cheap, mass manufacturing, are unlikely to be challenged by any electric vehicle competitor from a cost basis. Tesla is going to source its own raw materials for batteries for the most part, whereas their competitors are going to have to buy from third-party.   - unlike other car companies, Tesla doesn’t have entrenched unions, it doesn’t have colossal amounts of debt, it doesn’t have an entrenched dealership network opposed to electric vehicle adoption.  - unlike Apple and other electric vehicle start ups, tesla already has brand name recognition, a Pan-American repair and delivery network  - Tesla technology lead to pack right now. People have been saying for years that a Tesla killer was on the horizon. Currently not exists. Tesla had the first mover advantage of moving from a luxury, to semi luxury, to main stream car in order to facilitate their growth. Other companies don’t have this luxury, they have to produce a car competitive with the model Y and the model3 immediately, but without the strong internal engineering capacity while having to source parts including batteries and components from third parties.   **I genuinely don’t see a path to success for competitors outside of smaller niche market like small transport, vans, traditional truck designs, that sort of thing. I think Tesla has such a lead at the moment, that they are in the process of juicing the most out of capital expenses, their technology is so far ahead in terms of efficiency and cost, that they absolutely stand to benefit from competitor vehicles.**  In fact, I think the worst case scenario is that the entire auto sector ignores Tesla and continues business as usual, not normalizing electric vehicle ownership and letting Tesla be lord of a little kingdom rather than a prominent player in the entire auto sector.  One thing you guys need to keep in mind is that the current share price is, obviously, directly tied to future sales estimates. I genuinely think these are conservative. If the transition to an electric car market is hastened for the majority of Americans, and test the remains number one, the current number projections are exceedingly low. Especially when you factor in the profit margin on Tesla insurance, full self driving subscription, among others.|2020-12-23 13:17:50

gt02js|kir3c3|kir3c3|1|In terms of the stock market, what do you think was the defining month of the market for this year? I know most people would say March because it was the most memorable(-20% in a month, VIX spiking to 80)... but honestly for me... I'm gonna say April.  This year was defining, more than covid even, by the concept of "stonks only go up" and "brrr printing". No month of the year defined that more than April.  " **April** was the **stock** market's **best** month in over 30 years with the S&P 500 gaining 12.7%, the Dow 11.1% and the Nasdaq 15.5%. "  During April, we still had the massive random down days, particularly early in the month. But it was more than countered by massive green up spike days. There were days in April where there would be "promising news on vaccine", even just rumors of it, and SPY would go up 2-3% in one day.  April is when we saw the worst economic data in history, and the Dow would be up 500 points on the news. Worst unemployment/jobless claims number ever, and Dow up 700pts. 900 point rally on open, then it fades all the way to break even on the day.  April is when the massive rally in a a lot of the meme stocks we referenced throughout the year(PTON, ZM, NET, CRWD, ETSY, VTIQ(NKLA), TSLA) all really started to gain serious traction.|2020-12-23 09:47:15

Vix will HANDS DOWN be the best play of early 2021. Remember the spike we saw this week? That was nothing. We’ll see 10-20x that soon.|2020-12-23 13:12:36

gtib34|kir3c3|kir3c3|0|Someone posted this here yesterday and got kinda crapped on by people, so, let's just confirm it:     Sorrento (SRNE) will own approx. 2.5% of the new NK/Immunity Bio publicly traded enterprise.  They filed confirmation of that today:  [https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11806/html](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11806/html)     In today's dollars, at this moment in time, that stake is worth $140 million.     So, let me repeat, SRNE owns 2.5% of the new NK / Immunity Bio reverse merger and the 8.2 million shares of the public company they will hold is worth $140 million.  They were previously holding 10 mill shares of a private entity.     SRNE's cash burn has been approx. $20 mill per month.     Besides COVID diagnostics (STIX filed yesterday) and COVID drugs (multiple trials ongoing) to fund operations short term, SRNE can literally just unload its $140 mill NK / Immunity Bio stake to get 6+ months of working capital.  So no, they're not going to need to keep endlessly diluting as they work toward their path to profitability.|2020-12-23 12:26:40

They also dabble in letting people gamble. They are now making more per customer than the annual subscription rate. 90+% approval on Glassdoor. 100% approval of the CEO. This is a HUGE 2021 stock.
