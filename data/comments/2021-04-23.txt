vljr2m|mwrux2|mwrux2|188|I've been AFK for a bit from the modchat and discord. They uncovered evidence that they're pretty sure makes MVIS a pump, something about emails being sent around from which DD is being copy+pasted here or something, and brigading. Idk the specifics, I'm out of the loop.  It turns out they were blocking that ticker sporadically yesterday (via automod) while trying to figure out what to do. Personally I think the right move would have been publicly saying something **first** then blocking it **second**, but I wasn't involved in the decision. I had about as much information as any of you had about it up until twenty minutes ago, which is a problem because how were you supposed to know why it was happening if I didn't either?  So no, my bots are not to blame. WSB is not fuk. It is not some nefarious conspiracy. It is not *hedge fund shilling*. The mods are not on the take. They're not pumping MVIS, they're not dumping MVIS. It has no relation to GME. It's just people being shortsighted and trying to do the right thing. Sorry for technically lying to a bunch of people yesterday saying "omg we don't block MVIS". **That part bothers me the most.**  I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus, those dudes are my homies, I'm trying to stop the entire community from getting thrown under the bus by decent decisions made with terrible optics/implementation. We've already got enough conspiracy theory stuff being leveled at us without giving them more ammo by doing the right thing the wrong way. We very rarely block any ticker because.. y'know.. people thought GME was a pump too since people liked it. Just how it is. I can't even think of the last ticker we blocked.  EDIT: To be clear, I have no idea if MVIS will be considered spam or not, but that's what's been going on. And most of these angry replies are from people with a ton of history in the MVIS subreddit, which is kind of a problem in itself that I don't know how to handle.  **EDIT 2:** The issue isn't settled FYI. They're talking about it, I expect you'll either see what they considered when making the call yesterday or have it unblocked. I think if we're gonna do something like this what we have to show for it should withstand public scrutiny. We'll try to do it that way going forward.|2021-04-23 13:55:44

vjvkak|mwrux2|mwrux2|16|Stock futures are a bit higher, with small caps leading the major indices. Russell 2000 is up 0.6%. Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all up about 0.2%. That‚Äôs as of 0630.  This follows a day of selling in reaction to President Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Family Plan,‚Äù which is to be funded mainly by increasing the capital gains tax and the top income tax rate. Predictably, markets don‚Äôt like this plan very much.  It may not be relevant because it probably has little chance of passing through Congress. Too many Democrat senators are probably beholden to the financial sector for this to happen. And you only need one defection to kill it. More likely it will be watered down significantly. And even then it won‚Äôt affect most retail traders. The rich, meanwhile, will find loopholes. They always do.  So this is likely another market overreaction to news. It overshadows a day of mostly positive earnings results, though not from airlines (American and Southwest both fell short of estimates and their stocks sold off. They are rebounding in the premarket however).  Couple of earnings on tap today, led by American Express, Honeywell, and Kimberly Clark.  Still say things are set up pretty well for stocks to move higher, but you shouldn‚Äôt listen to me on that.|2021-04-23 05:38:10

vl6jzs|mwrux2|mwrux2|19|Why it's time to take your profit on OCGN:  I have been following OCGN for months when they initially partnered with Bharat Bioscience and was initially extremely bullish and rode OCGN from $6 to 16 the first time. After doing more DD, there are too many risks for OCGN to be valued at 2B.     * OCGN only makes money on Covaxin vaccinations in the US * The 70% efficacy is significantly below both Pfizer and Moderna, which we already mass producing enough of to cover the entire population forever * They still need EUA approval, which will take several weeks if not months, as there would still need to be an independent trial conducted in the US * By the time their vaccine is maybe approved, 80%+ of people in the US would already be vaccinated * Covaxin takes a long time to manufacture and OCGN still needs to develop the manufacturing facilities in the US to even start manufacturing * The price of vaccine is low, like $10-20 total, the small margins then are split among OCGN and Bharat Bioscience(the company who developed the vaccine) * They only make 45% of profit per vaccination in the US, only place where they can sell it, which is about\~$5 They would need 25 Million vaccinations a year just to make 125M, not happening * They had adverse reaction issues they swept under the rug in India in order to fast track this to market  TLDR Even if OCGN gets EUA, it will take too long for them to get the vaccine to market in the US, the margins will be low, the market will be saturated, and their efficacy is lower than American competitors.

I don't hear you crying wolf on the days you angrily shovel money into pockets from an illogically skyrocketing market. We are a bubble, on top of another bubble, expanding from another bubble. A gentle breeze could break everything, but we continue on so long as nothing changes. No matter who is in office, this will pop, but this bubble wasn't built overnight and certainly not in the last few months.

vkldne|mwrux2|mwrux2|1|So short story! Last year i quit my job in industry to follow my dreams full time. My passion is music and i decided to follow that passion partially cause of the worldwide news coverage of the GME "manipulation" that u guys flared last year. This made me realize that we all have the power to play the game to our own end if we set our minds to it.  Whether it would be stock market, music market or job market etc. Shit its always some market.  We are all powered by the same source and that is life itself. It can all go away as quick as it came so stop blaming the game and just focus to play.  We can all feel better with the ability in all of us to make ourselves better each day just little by little and remember that we can always elevate ourselves and the power is in numbers. I love the fact that the hedge fund multi billionaires were trembling to the guys little and big when united. My songs lyrics are a big part for this power and all i can say is do more and [Game 0n!](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willjoy/game-0n-3) Or should i say [GME ON!](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willjoy/game-0n-3)|2021-04-23 09:47:02

vkybl0|mwrux2|mwrux2|1|Hy guys, I would like to address to them smart asses in this group. I know that this group is full of retardas and thats totally fine, but I think in need smart answers for my question.  It's concerning the VXX that made almost 300% over night. So my question is: why did that happen? Is it  1. The rollover effect to the next vix contract  2. The first sign of heavy market correction that would fit to the actual chart view (Nas maybe double topped)  3. A squeeze that was needed to adequately let markets search for higher tops in the next months, followed by a quick VXX reduction back to around 10   Im rly not into this so I am very interesseted to hear proffessionals talk about this topic.

vkyrk1|mwrux2|mwrux2|0|Okay, biggest retard of the day here asking for some explanation of my retarted actions. Yesterday, after market close, I made a spy 4/23 415c call. The price type was Limit, good for day, buy open, and the limit price was .38, so ultimately I paid $38 for the call.  This morning, at market open, I see the price was executed at .29. I check my E*TRADE portfolio and see that I‚Äôm somehow like -$2,300 in debt for the 4/23 call. I‚Äôm freaking out but I know I have time on my side, I have the rest of the day for spy to fight back.  I check spy like two minutes later and see it‚Äôs gone up from 413.04 to like 413.29. I check my portfolio again and suddenly I made like $30. Like the smooth-brained paper hands bitch that I am, I sell immediately, not wanting that -2,300 debt.  My question is: where did that debt come from? I thought calls could only expire worthless, I didn‚Äôt realize I could go into that much debt from a call.  So my retartedness is two-fold: I sold a winning call AND I clearly don‚Äôt understand how options work because of the immediate debt I was in when the market opened. Plz help me understand. Also I have no idea how much money I lost from selling that call about five mins after market open vs if I sold now, when spy is at 416.50|2021-04-23 11:23:33
