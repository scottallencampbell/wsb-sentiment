3dmoms|tvy9r4|tvy9r4|4|its funny but u wonder how these analysts feels on days like this  > GLJ keeps $67 target on Tesla, says delivery disclosure raises risk  > TSLA GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson keeps a Sell rating on Tesla with a $67 price target after the company's Q1 deliveries fell short of consensus expectations. For the first time since Q1 of 2017, Tesla removed the following language from its delivery disclosure: "We only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct," Johnson tells investors in a research note. "This begs the question, including the language TSLA took out of the Q1 delivery report, would the numbers have been lower than the 310K reported," asks Johnson. The analyst sees risk that Tesla's "apple-to-apples" quarter-over-quarter delivery comparison is worse than what was reported this weekend.|2022-04-04 12:39:04

3cewyo|tvy9r4|tvy9r4|6|WSJ on ballooning debt and surging food prices:  >A surge in food and fuel prices is raising pressure on governments around the world to pick up the tab for consumers, stretching precarious public finances and intensifying political instability in the shakiest economies.  >Spooked by protests that have broken out recently from Bangkok to Sicily, many governments have adopted subsidies or tax breaks to shield households and businesses from the soaring prices.  >Yet the handouts are boosting already high government debt just as borrowing costs are rising. For some countries, the increase may prove too much to afford, raising the specter of political unrest.  Everyone thinks that the answer to rising rates destroying budgets will lead to rate reversal.  Partially yes but no one realizes that a temporary return to fiscal hawkishness will also return.  Edit: also from the [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-is-piling-on-debt-as-it-battles-inflation-11649064601?mod=hp_lead_pos3)  >“They are making it too expensive for us,” said Mohammad Fakhani, the owner of several bakeries and dessert shops in Beirut. “The price of a bag of flour keeps multiplying, it’s like fiction.”  You can't just throw money at commodities.  It just doesn't work because everyone immediately absorbs the higher price.|2022-04-04 07:30:53

3e1p2p|tvy9r4|tvy9r4|3|HMHC sales process looks problematic for sure.  They upgraded the sales/EBITDA guidance after reaching the final 2 bidders and didn't notify the rest of the several dozen companies interested (that previously dropped out) that HMHC sales/EBITDA expectations was going to be much higher than what they'd shared with bidders previously.  Tender offer will be close but if Veritas doesn't clinch the deal at $21 on Thursday, should be upside if Veritas is forced to up their bid.  Biggest risk though if <30% tender at which point I'd imagine Veritas just drops the bid, but that is unlikely.|2022-04-04 14:15:02

He also started the DRS trend and spearheaded the movement. He made guides and everything. People thought he was literally Ryan Cohen. DRS was the 12th key to moass!   Then one day, he posted his “proof” that he also DRS’d his own shares. Except he didn’t do a good enough job of redacting his information. People were able to make out that he had a single digit share count that started with a 3 or a 5.  In ape-like fashion, those that said “YO WHAT THE FUCK?!” were downvoted, called shills, and banned.   Criand issued an apology and got many asspats. He also promised (and delivered) to DRS 13 more shares.   The king of the apes was not RC, he wasn’t even a whale, he was a kid with 16 shares.    So, who’s your favorite ape leader?|2022-04-04 10:46:04

3c1iex|tvy9r4|tvy9r4|3|Stay in cash gang bois!!!  Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping after having risen, this is the most reliable indicator signaling significant moves in the stock market. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. The s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now) Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.  AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.  Bull cases: WW3 might not happen. Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-04-04 05:03:41

3dbq2z|tvy9r4|tvy9r4|5|Living in Britain is such a miserable existence, on the planet. 70% of the people are on welfare, the rest are nutters, we are all Ellis Island rejects. Each Saturday morning everyone goes 'to the shops'. Taking 'the bus' is the most common form of transport. The only commercials on TV are for housewives laundry detergent or death insurance. Young girls hang out at the bus station to seek excitement from boys, but invariably he is just a friends brother. Everyone saves up for their yearly getaway for a week at a package holiday in Ibiza. I'd rather be a Rice farmer in China. Any physical adversity is preferable to the mental existential suffering I have to endure waking up every day here, jfc|2022-04-04 11:28:43

Past 2 months or so /r/sndl has a daily that is riddled with bots or straight up boomers… having tough time distinguishing whats what.  Any yall ever see something like that.
