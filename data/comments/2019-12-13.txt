annibw|ea2n60|ea2n60|2|i think we should be asking "why do the chinese feel the need to hold a press conference in the first place"? why not just use twitter like the past? we know that the current offer of delaying tariffs and cutting 50% of existing tariffs was actually offered a week ago, which the chinese didn't respond to in the first place, which means they didn't want it. trump, however, went ahead himself and thrust the one-sided deal out there. what resulted was the explosion of US markets.  i think this press conference is to publicly and formally announce that china is done playing this game with trump. they know the effects trump's tweet had on the market yesterday, and generally how he's manipulating the market. they're tired of it.   again, the key is, this "deal" was already offered, but china didn't accept it then; why would they accept it now?|2019-12-13 08:04:49
