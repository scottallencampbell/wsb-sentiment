f40n27|erbv24|erbv24|6|2007 The Dow opened the year at 12,459.54.6Ôªø It rose despite growing concerns about the subprime mortgage crisis. On Nov. 17, 2006, the U.S. Commerce Department warned that October's new home permits were 28% lower than the year before.7ÔªøÔªø8Ôªø But economists didn't think the housing slowdown would affect the rest of the economy. In fact, they were relieved that the overheated real estate market appeared to be returning to normal.   The Fed began adding liquidity by buying banks‚Äô subprime mortgages.9Ôªø In October, economists warned about the widespread use of collateralized debt obligations and other derivatives.  As the year drew to a close, the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its growth estimate higher.10Ôªø It said that the nation‚Äôs gross domestic product had increased by 0.5% in the third quarter. Its prior estimate said it had shrunk 0.5%. It seemed the U.S. economy could shrug off a housing downturn and banks‚Äô liquidity constraints. The Dow ended the year just slightly off its October high, at 13,264.82.|2020-01-20 14:42:42

I'm confused because I was under the impression that only buyers could close out contracts early, and sellers had to wait for the buyers to exercise.
