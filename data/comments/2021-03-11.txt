qkd02t|m2not4|m2not4|231|I'm 40 years old, i've never owned a stock in my life until this year.  I just kinda found reddit looking for hockey news and started seeing some funny dead inside video clips that kept me coming back.  As i kept returning more frequently this year, three letters kept catching my eye, g, m and e.  Then the first sky rocket to $400+ happened.    I go home to my apartment and i'm telling my wife about it, our son(14) hears me and comes out from his room and says 'stonks'.  Thats it, thats enough for me, i'm gonna figure this shit out!    About 4 business days later I have my first trader account with a broker app and a very modest balance.  We buy a gme share a couple amc shares and a couple clean energy type shares, clne was kinda looking interesting.  My son did all the purchases as i was at work and hes doing half his grade 9 at home, i thought it would be cool parenting to let him handle the dips and such since i didnt have anyone to show me that shit when i was his age (my dad was a drug traffiker).  Since then we have bought a few more amc (9) and one more gme (2) and a few more different cheaper than a dollar shares, we're holding until they reach astronomical levels and then we will sell 1 gme and 8 amc.  That is our families plan.  Now mondays are the best, we all watch the market, we are all learning new market terms and we all like the stock.  By we i mean me and my family, not you retards.|2021-03-11 06:15:48

qkhvp1|m2not4|m2not4|64|Very important: guys dont spend too much time on reddit and megathreads.   Why? These threads can be very manipulating.  I often find myself picking up the general consens of these threads. This goes up and down. Very often I have a good feeling about something then I go into this thread read tons of negative comments and immediately feel like okay I better should not do this and that. So, i am a retarded idiot and of course you would think lol who cares about what they write here, many people do, they sort by new and read every comment and get too emotionally invested in this.   Even now, people here talk like GME is dead after a heavy attack from which it recovered after like 20 minutes. While I thought before "wow we are on the same level after yesterday" I read some discussion threads and immediately feel like I missed the chance of my life and regret my decisions.   Tl;dr: trust your gut or good dds but dont trade dependend on comments in megathreads.|2021-03-11 07:12:03
qk7w2k|m2not4|m2not4|117|For those new to whats happening:  70mil shares exist, 20 mil shares are institutional and untradeable. that 50mil left over (excluding naked shorts) is what is being fought over by the big guys.  The Short side is attacking the stock in a relatively smart way, getting it on the short restricted  list today rather than friday. If they can kill enough confidence, and fight a wall price at whatever undisclosed price they need it to stay below, friday when the Short Restriction is lifted they can attack even harder to shore up losses on options contracts for 3/12  What were are seeing is no doubt sell offs by BIG BIG money to crash price and recoup from the options market contracts. NOT HUGE RETAIL SELL OFF. We could never have this huge of an effect as what we are seeing today and and saw yesterday. were just smack dab in the middle of a battle between big boys with unfathomable money.  The upside is the Long Big Money is also likely waiting to see how much the short side is willing to let loose so they can buy it up. but timing is everything atm. that is why shorts were happy to see highs wednesday and no doubt planned for this to crash it wednesday. But, there is still many more moves to be made on both sides  This was a cold war. Its now a hot one. Defcon 5 friends  Strap in and watch the show. 100k is not a meme.|2021-03-11 05:13:30

I keep myself grounded in knowing *exactly* how much money I'm willing to potentially gamble with before I go in, and I very militantly refuse to increase that amidst the dopamine rush, but sometimes I do find that during the rare moments of surging like we're doing right now, I find myself thinking "FFS, what would another $400 have been? You could have had an extra ten shares to play with!"  It's quite a feeling üòÇ I'm very good at willpower and resisting any kind of addictive impulse so no matter how loudly this voice shouts in my head, I'll never break my own personal limits or anything like that.

qk92gd|m2not4|m2not4|64|What we saw yesterday with GME is the most blatant market manipulation that I¬¥ve ever seen. and no SEC officials nor NYSE officials would say a fucking word. Good job fellas, you got your place in hell.  I feel sorry for those desperate shorts trying to tank the price and watching it go back a hundred dollars just minutes after they massively sold it. It¬¥s not just a matter of price but also a way to try to kill the momentum, to scare us, to let us know that they have the power to do whatever they want to because we are the "little guy".  I¬¥ve been holding GME since late January, I¬¥ve seen the stock going down every single day for almost a month and, let me tell you,  panic, frustration and fear have been my breakfast for over a month, I kinda like it now. I got used to it.  GME is transforming its business towards an ecommerce business model, changing management, cutting costs, etc., and these are the real good news for us. It doesn¬¥t matter if a gamma squeeze or a short squeeze ever happens. The real battle ground is in other field, remember that shorts thought this company would be bankrupt and so far they are absolutely wrong. Don¬¥t forget that the 25th of February the stock was 40$.  I would expect what happened yesterday to be repeated and I¬¥m ready. Just waiting. Just buying and HODLING.  Much love for yall apes!|2021-03-11 05:26:24

ql10uv|m2not4|m2not4|6|Anecdotal analysis of RBLX and why I bought in.  Every kid I know under 18 has been hooked on it for years.  It brings 3 things together that don't necessarily exist in many other platforms:  1. A solid social platform.  Roblox + Discord seems to be how a lot of kids I known manage school and relationships in the age of covid. 2. It is a solid learning platform.  The prospect of moving from Roblox to Roblox studio in order to create your own games for your friends seems to capture a lot of kids imaginations.  I know 2 people in college now studying CS who started by teaching themselves Lua and Blender for creating games in Roblox. 3. A solid path for continued cash flow.  The in-platform trading aspects folded into many games seems to keep a lot of folks hooked on converting USD to Robux.  With the addition of in game advertising for creators, you have a live platform that will capture more and more attention and will create additional incentives for game creators.  I'm not suggesting that you buy, and I don't have a solid analysis on an entry or target, but this is why I like the stock.|2021-03-11 09:52:19

Swings like yesterday's were happening in so many of the companies that people would throw limit buy orders in way below the trading price.  The people thought the company was worth a ride, short or long term but the price was so volatile, you could throw a limit buy in $100 less than the current price and hey, sometimes you'd catch the bottom, the middle, the crash.. who knows?  But, worth knowing about. I've got a couple out there for today.  Plus it's fun to say. Stink bid. Put that in your mouth.|2021-03-11 07:30:44

You pick her up at 7:00, you guys go for a romantic round of mini-golf, and then out to dinner. Over dinner, the topic of the stock market comes up. You mention you trade a little  on the side, and she gets curious. She flirtingly asks to see your portfolio. You pull out your phone and open the app and hand it over to her. Suddenly, she laughs so hard that she snorts. And it isn't a cute laugh, its a mean, condescending laugh. She looks at you, still laughing, and manages to chuckle out "No $PLTR?".  Your face grows red with embarrassment and you get angry. How do you deal with a situation like that?|2021-03-11 13:21:46

Well, when people buy calls, they induce the call seller to purchase enough shares to hedge his bet. Call sellers are more risk aversive than yall, they aren't going to risk losing a ton of money on their call from GME skyrocketing. So, in essence, you've contributed to 100 shares being purchased through the buying of your call option, 5x what you yourself would have been able to purchase.

qkqmeg|m2not4|m2not4|4|Honest question (please don't downvote for lack of confirmation bias):  What is the current thesis on GME?  I'm a holder and got in because of the squeeze.  But I'm reading that short interest has dropped significantly at this point.  I also know that the company is transforming to online (vs brick and mortar), but nothing has been established yet and I don't think it will end up being worth more than Amazon.  So what's the catalyst to driving this up to $10K, $100K, etc.?|2021-03-11 08:31:53

ql7tek|m2not4|m2not4|4|I know this isn‚Äôt for GME discussion, but here goes ...  Situations that can make you rich are extremely rare, made even more rare by said individual seizing the opportunity and taking the necessary steps to attain it. GME was a once-in-a-decade situation, and if the new changes by the SEC/DTCC concerning transparency and limitations on shorting come to fruition, it will become a once-in-a-lifetime event. This movement has effectively changed the future of the stock market. Regardless of how you feel about those investing or the effect it is having on the market as a whole, it needs to be acknowledged for what it is, special. While it can be stressful, it has also been a fun thing to be a part of thus far.  If you‚Äôre invested in GME, it‚Äôs been a wild ride that is still ongoing, and if you‚Äôre not, I hope you‚Äôre benefitting from the stocks you are invested in. Appreciate all who took the time to read this.  No financial advice|2021-03-11 10:42:42

ql327i|m2not4|m2not4|1|I'm quite new to stock market and investing, I only got involved because of what people were saying about GME(I read enough from people saying buy and not buy then made my own decision to buy). But since I've been in, I've been noticing there regularly seems to be stocks shooting up multiple times what they were worth within the last few days. There was EYES earlier this week went from $1.40 close last Thursday, to almost $20 Monday or Tuesday. I've just seen ENTX is up 300% today. Is this a very common occurrence, or is it just recently that the stock market has become highly volatile? Is it a knock on effect from GME getting the attention of every day Joe's, like myself, looking at the stock market and then people FOMO'ing and jumping onto any stock thats increasing and pushing that price up even further?|2021-03-11 10:07:32

qm0s2x|m2not4|m2not4|-1|Hey everyone, let‚Äôs all stop investing in these DANGEROUS meme stocks, we can WORK for a living, and if we‚Äôre smart with our money, live on a tight budget, live below our means, we might be able to retire comfortably in our 50s or 60s.  Youth isn‚Äôt about enjoying life, it‚Äôs about working to enjoy it later.  Forgo living in the city, forgo having all of those fancy tech toys, forgo marriage, forgo having kids, forgo having sex. Just focus on career, and you can be rich when you retire at 55-65!  Oh shit, that was a COMPLETE waste of a life, I‚Äôm old now, my dick doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm bald, my organs are failing, and I‚Äôve done nothing but work since my 20s, living cheap around a bunch of ‚Äúpro-life Christian conservatives‚Äù.  It‚Äôs been lonely, and miserable, sexless, loveless, isolation, but at least I‚Äôm very wealthy now! Oh shit, i guess my wealth will go straight to the taxpayers when I die, because I got old before I could be wealthy enough to enjoy life, so no one to leave my money for.  But that‚Äôs what life is about, working and WASTING your youth away, to retire and enjoy some leisure when you‚Äôre old and closer to death.  I‚Äôm 25, how do I prevent this from being my life if I can‚Äôt achieve 6-7 figure wealth within the next few years?|2021-03-11 14:11:02

qleoe3|m2not4|m2not4|0|Need some help figuring this out. This is trading mechanics related, just happens to be a trade involving GME.  Bought 1 $800 call for 3/12 on GME at 2.30/share, because why not lose some money. That's literally the entire reason, just felt like maybe things would go crazy this week.  I then realized I don't know what happens afterward. Because I figured out what a call was and forgot there was more after that.  If I have one contract, can I sell it back at whatever price it is worth, or does it count as me personally selling an 800 call and the 800 call I have not doing anything, opening me up to potentially infinite losses for selling a call?  If I end up ITM, how do I exercise if I don't have the capital to purchase the stocks at the strike price? The strike price is 802.30 right? I don't have 80k lying around, how do I get money out of this?  My current plan is to have the contract expire and lose the 230 I put into it. I have no idea what to do if it ends up ITM. I probably could've figure it out more before I bought an option.  &#x200B;  Edit: Sell to close is a thing. Should've done that yesterday when the call price went from 2.30 to 7.something.

So if the stock was to somehow get above  ¬£25,000 a single share you would not be able to set up a limit order. Additionally you would have to manually set up an order for every single position you have, which if you've got thousands of shares available is going to take a while.  I don't even know if basic order would allow you to sell any shares if that was the price|2021-03-11 06:57:19

qktfv9|m2not4|m2not4|-9|GME is a huge pyramid schema luring in suckers with the promise of big a "gamma squeeze" for a company with 0 prospects. It's a matter of who pulls their money when and mathematically not everyone could be winners in this scenario. Small time investor with rent money riding on it will be the ones getting crushed when the pyramid comes tumbling down. If you bought it at 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s even 50s, yeah diamond hands hold on congratulations, you are close to the tip of the pyramid, but others, you will probably get impacted negatively.|2021-03-11 08:54:37
qkkmh9|m2not4|m2not4|-1|Im just curious. When it was going up. Some people begged for a big dip. Now theyre scared?? I didnt hold for one day and "lost" 2-3k but at the same time If I was still in I wouldnt have anticipated the mega dip and probably panic sold (if the halts wouldnt interfere). So yesterday showed us that anything can happen.  You put in money and think that its probably just gonna be a mild dip at worst. Well you are wrong. If you cannot imagine losing the whole bet then you should not invest in an overpriced highly volatile stocks. I love GME. I believe it will be traded at a fair price with their company being revamped. But the price now is still overpriced. So take your gains, minimize your losses or sell majority and keep a little inside like I did if youre scared it may either moon without your or tank to the ground again.  If I lose the money I put now in its okay. If I make some money its okay. I dont care at this point. I feared this outcome. People wouldnt sell when it was low because they refused to sell at loss. But they may sell now to save their gains. Especially the noobs.|2021-03-11 07:39:22

qkkt66|m2not4|m2not4|-7|SSR ftw!  If there's a squeeze on GME, then great, we get to take money out the hands of people who have too much, but even if that doesn't happen, GME is worth a lot more than the low hundred range it's in now. It's undervalued now. There are people with actual wrinkles on their brains that say this (Uncle Bruce!). This is a brick and mortar company who look to be transitioning to an ecommerce first approach. If they pull that off, which they damn well can, then $600+ per share is completely reasonable. The fact that this stock is shorted to retarded levels is only a win for anyone with a long position. There are only around 50 million shares available to trade each day, yet the trading volume yesterday was 71.57M and back in January peaked at around 197 million. You're not going to get that kind of movement from 50 million shares alone. This volume can only happen if there are an absolute fucking motherload of shares being shorted naked or contracts with naked options. Those naked positions can't remain undelivered forever. Sooner or later the shorts will be forced to buy back and cover by the clearing houses. Some of the jumps up in price over the last few days could well have been that happening already, but this shitstorm has barely even started.|2021-03-11 07:41:05

That alone is reason enough :)  But besides that  \- the price is relatively low and has a lot of room for improvement- a high spread indicates that the share is still little traded- **and above all:** because there is a not insignificant chance that there is a not inconsiderable chance that other nostalgics also see it as I do ;)..

Will replace airlines in long distance travel. It's the Tesla of airlines. 3. It was hit hard during the tech selloff due to interest rate increases, so it's cheap relative to its potential growth. 4. It can allow you to travel from New York to Beijing in 3 hours. 5. It takes 1/10 fuel, produces 1/10 C02. This ratio improves with distance. 6. The highest expense for airlines is fuel consumption. 7. Rockets are a lot easier to produce and maintain than jet engines. 8. It doesn't need massive infrastructural investment like hyperloop technology. 9. Don't you want to be on a rocket instead of just watch them? 10. The majority of airline income is due to business travel. For high end business travelers that get paid 400,000$ to speak for a few hours, time is money. They will be willing to spend top dollar to cut down their travel expenses.
