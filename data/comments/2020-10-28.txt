adfzfy|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|10|Main thing to watch imo is the dollar and metals.  Until the dollar really breaks down or out of this "no man's land range" (DXY between 92 and 95), I don't think the markets move significantly higher.  And metals have just been a messy trade the past 5-6 weeks, unable to support big upward moves.  It's definitely possible that this is bottoming though with all the stimulus bullishness being flushed out of the system and coronavirus numbers spiking in Europe/US.  This really reminds me of pre-election 2016 with all the uncertainty and then markets just moving higher once the uncertainty was past.  Only issue is whether that really requires us to get to late November and to another coronavirus peak.|2020-10-28 07:16:27

I will die as I have lived. Alone, hopeless, and in tears.   Piles and piles of student debt. A high school teaching job that pays nothing. 80 dollars to my name. No idea how I'm going to pay my bills next month. No friends. No family. Nothing in my life whatsoever to bring me an ounce of joy except for the fact that existence isn't permanent.  Now I don't even have "Yolos" to look forward to. My only chance to escape this hell hole of poverty and despair has disappeared. There is no "crawling back to my feet."   &#x200B;  I have no qualifications. No skills. I barely make enough money to pay my bills. I have no hobbies. Not a single damn thing to look forward to.

adocbk|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|5|the last time we had as large of a change in communication technology was the invention of the printing press.     The printing press led to Martin Luther and the protestant reformation and created 150 years of non stop religious warfare which killed about 20% of Europe from 1510 to 1650.     The creation of the internet in the same way is fragmenting people who are dissatisfied with the status quo and fostering extremism but we have seen this before. While Luther first challenged the church, his followers soon fragmented, you had the rise of the calvanists and a million sects that followed. The original fake news was the printing press created the platform for Malleus Maleficarum to go viral and led to witch trials which spread across europe which resulted in an execution of an estimated 50-100k people.

adh3an|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|9|# Did anyone get this message in their DM's?  Hey xxx, I am randomly messaging people on WSB to get some to do my referrals. I may have lost some money on tesla calls...  Anyway, do you have SoFi? If not, then you might be eligible for a $300 bonus offer they are doing right now.  SoFi is major bank offering a $300 referral promotion for opening a loan with them using a referral link. However, there are easy ways to game this system. You can just open a 5k loan, then pay the whole thing off the next day. That way, you pocket the $300 bonus. People on the SoFi subreddit are doing this, I can show you proof that it works if needed. I also get $300 from you using my referral link, hence why I am reaching out to people randomly like this.  This only will work for people who haven't had a loan with SoFi before.  Let me know if you might be interested in using my link. Thank you.  # get out of my DM papi|2020-10-28 07:29:29

adb0zk|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|4|PLTR; I‚Äôm loading up on these calls. 5-1 calls to puts yesterday, 10-1 the day before. 50,000 calls expiring this Friday purchased yesterday, most of them out of the money, against 4000 puts.  I think these options are cheap enough for the average WSBer to purchase, and it looks like more and more of them are doing exactly that. This thing can definitely go tits up, so be careful.|2020-10-28 06:08:06

I've got a whole bunch tied up in calls and it looks like I'm going to lose some money. Nokia keeps getting all these contracts they're going to the Moon literally and they're doing something else with the military and pentagon. I just don't understand what it takes to push that stock up over $5. But makes matters worse I bought AMD. Of course I did the coin flip and was considering buying xylinks and still putting everything in AMD. I should have gone 50/50 as xilinx and the other 50 and AMD. But did I? Nope.

ad93v5|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|13|Do you feel that the selling is a little overblown? If you do it probably is... Kinda hard to pinpoint a reason why for the sell off other than election fears and covid.  Let's put some context on why those two things are causing people to sell.  Election fears : This fear is a pretty weird thing to sell over. What could possibly cause big name companies to be effected by an election other than the person's policies? If you're scared Biden is going to raise the capital tax then I've got news for you... The proposed tax rate will be lower than the higher tax rates we saw 8 years ago. +surprised Pikachu face*. Plus let's be honest we all have losses so we'll get a tax break.  COVID : This has been priced into the market since March. Big tech names continue to be pulled forward and have shown through 2 quarters of earnings that they remain profitable. Why be scared and sell?  Tldr :scaredy cat people are selling. Buying dips is hard because it's red. Don't buy high buy low. Nibble some here on good names and buy more later.|2020-10-28 05:37:03

adfo82|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|7|For all of the clouds,  some economic data is still positive, such as consumer spending and elevated savings for households (which means people still have more cash to spend).  The manufacturing index has hit record high and has improved for 4 straight quarters.    Don't buy puts at open.  Wait until at least over 1 hour after open to see where we are going.  We will have a red day, but you might be able to get a discount on the puts if there is a  pump after the initial red open.|2020-10-28 07:12:38

adhoxk|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|4|Alright gentlemen, here's the deal. SPY is going to gap down pretty big today. The hourly and 4 hour will likely be very oversold with RSI at 30 or lower. It also looks like we're opening right at the 100 DMA. Gap downs are for buying.   The short term play here is to buy a SPY call expiring Friday. We're not just going to keep dumping, we'll likely bounce intra day (still close red) and tomorrow should be green for an oversold bounce  Good luck!|2020-10-28 07:36:23

aef41r|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|2|With European lockdown measures, spiking cases, etc...feels like the US could potentially be only a few weeks behind in terms of economically damaging social restrictions.  If that narrative does play out, virus concerns could outweigh the election impacts on markets:  The electoral impact of the recent surge in cases is obvious, with Trump‚Äôs handling of COVID-19 the pre-eminent issue of the election. How much the rise in cases, particularly in Midwest swing states, hurts him at this late stage remains to be seen, but it certainly is hard to see how it helps him. But US case growth also begs a new question: will the market reaction on any election outcome be dwarfed by virus concerns, no matter who wins?  The risk of this is certainly rising ‚Äì if we get a Democratic sweep the roadmap is for steeper curves and higher yields, but if it comes amidst spiking cases, increased lockdowns, fears of economic damage, and speculation that the Fed will extend the duration of QE at the December meeting, the election reaction may be more muted.|2020-10-28 12:22:09

Yeah, it could be messy, but it could also be a blueout. Stocks like CGC,CRON, TCNNF, CURLF, GTBIF, CRLBF, GRWG these are the absolutely strongest marijuana stocks by cash on hand, balance sheet, revenues, you name it. These are the ones most set to benefit by the most likely outcomes. Even if you forget the federal election, you have 13 states voting on marijuana reform, you have a Senate that if it goes blue will pass the STATES ACT and MORE ACT. These laws can decriminalize marijuana and allow access to banking, leading to uplistings and huge investment, that currently is not possible. Stay calm üåø|2020-10-28 08:44:20

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,  If I am dead, as dead I well may be,  You'll come and find the place where I am lying,  And kneel and say an Ave there for me.  And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,  And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,  For you will bend and tell me that you love me,  And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!|2020-10-28 07:47:30

ae0i4u|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|1|Your wife brushes her hair as you watch silently from the bed. This is when you find her most beautiful: she‚Äôs in her nightly routine, humming softly, wearing ancient pajamas she got one Christmas when she was still a girl.  ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at?‚Äù The question startles you. You stare at her like this most nights, and she never notices. But now she smiles at you‚Äîor rather her reflection in the mirror does‚Äîwith an inquisitive eyebrow raised.  ‚ÄúNothing much,‚Äù you try to joke, casually. But she turns around immediately, to look over her shoulder at you: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù The gravity of her tone briefly catches you off guard, but you collect yourself: ‚ÄúWhat? Nothing‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù She stares at your face a bit longer, and then satisfied you aren‚Äôt lying‚Äîbecause she trusts you more than any human being she‚Äôs ever known‚Äîshe turns back to her mirror and hair brushing.  And you know why tonight, of all nights, she noticed you watching her: she could sense your fear. She doesn‚Äôt know what SPY is. Or a call. But something primal in her knows what you did with those things, and how it is eating you alive inside. Because she loves you.   Suddenly, you realize fully that you do not deserve the connection that allowed her to sense that in you, the connection that you lied in the face of. As her humming resumes, you start drafting your goodbye.|2020-10-28 10:29:27

If Pfizer's data is good it'll be a boon for the market.  Moderna has their vaccine potentially slated for use in Dec. as well.  Remdesavir is approved.  If the antibody cocktail Trump took gets approved it'll also be be a boost. There will be a drop here because of COVID, obviously, but I'd tread carefully expecting a repeat of March. It will be time to DCA.  The FED is also backstopping everything, and there may be some strategies to reduce hospital times for COVID cases coming to market very soon (remdesavir already is out there).|2020-10-28 14:13:13

adqpo2|jjl2qm|jjl2qm|-1|if you are thinking of buying the dip remember  the last time we had as large of a change in communication technology was the invention of the printing press.  The printing press led to Martin Luther and the protestant reformation and created 150 years of non stop religious warfare which killed about 20% of Europe from 1510 to 1650.  The creation of the internet in the same way is fragmenting people who are dissatisfied with the status quo and fostering extremism but we have seen this before. While Luther first challenged the church, his followers soon fragmented, you had the rise of the calvanists and a million sects that followed. The original fake news was the printing press created the platform for Malleus Maleficarum to go viral and led to witch trials which spread across europe which resulted in an execution of an estimated 50-100k people.  It started with German princess who did not want to be beholden to Catholic power. It led to large scaled civil wars, full blown wars between states, political assassinations on a daily basis, back alley battles, blood spilled in capitals, in alleyways. You had massive famines and wars basically nonstop for 150 years.   We are only at the beginning of a dark age of chaos. The printing press took 80 years to be adapted, the internet took 20 years. If we go by the same time frame, you should expect 35-40 years of non-stop civil war, global wars, famine.|2020-10-28 09:06:55
