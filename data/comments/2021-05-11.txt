xq1lek|n9th6n|n9th6n|8|In the summer of 2012, I owned a little stock called Facebook at $22.  I owned a bunch of it, and it couldn't get out of its own way. It kept dipping below $20 or even below $19, and people kept ripping it apart. "They'll never be able to monetize it", they said ... "You will lose your ass", they said.  I got out "even" and never got back in. It sits at $300 today.    How can DKNG possibly lose going forward as legislation continues to change and on-line gambling continues to grow?  But. Here I am questioning the stock as it plummets from $75 to $45.    &#x200B;  You know I'll buy more, but at what price? Where's the fucking bottom in this stock?|2021-05-11 07:50:14

xpqhpy|n9th6n|n9th6n|16|Futures are dropping this morning, with tech and small caps leading the way lower. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 already down 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. S&P 500 futures down 0.8%. Dow Industrials 0.6% lower. That’s as of 0635.  This follows another day of selling in tech. The Nasdaq was down 2.5% yesterday, its worst day since March. The index is now down 4% this month. Sell in May? Well, Dow Industrials are up 2.5% and the S&P is green as well (barely).  This begs two questions: 1. What’s causing the tech sell-off? 2. Is it a buying opportunity?  The former appears to be this ‘rotation trade’ into cyclicals (and staples). I suspect interest rate hikes are starting to be priced in as well. The latter I discuss on the audio.  Not much on the calendar today JOLTS jobs openings at 1000. Some Fed speeches. Electronic Arts is due to report earnings after the close, which may help that stock if not the broader tech market.|2021-05-11 05:50:05

xr6n9k|n9th6n|n9th6n|6|All I can say is, it seems like any kid under 13 only cares about Roblox, and their parents agree and are willing to invest in their kids. They see it as spending money on teaching their kid tech skills, not wasting money on a video game. Roblox is a fully featured game engine like Unity. To learn Roblox you have to learn to code and you have to learn digital asset creation skills like 3D/2D art and game design. Parents understand the value of encouraging their kids to learn these skills and are happy to buy their kid some Robux. And who cares if little Jaxon just spends it all on hats for his avatar?  Glad to see the RBLX stock price is finally reflecting reality here. It's not too late to buy in.|2021-05-11 12:48:08

xrecmg|n9th6n|n9th6n|4|Posted yesterday that I thought we'd see good upside moves from BRKS, RBLX, and MARA based on blowout earnings after the bell. Didn't know the market was going to come down hard first thing.  But here in the afternoon, market has recovered some and BRKS +2%, RBLX +17%, and MARA -8%. Of course, MARA's earnings were erroneously reported by Bezinga and perhaps others as negative -87c per share when it was actually +87c per share, so who knows if some saw this and maybe just too much down momentum on the miners  Full disclosure, I own all 3 above and added to positions prior to earnings release on dips. Also did on VIAC a few days ago but that is taking the slowly but surely approach.     .|2021-05-11 13:40:49

xrjop3|n9th6n|n9th6n|5|Hell of a day to be a gay bull. Sold my puts about an hour after open. Bought calls that have been printing ever since. Day trading portfolio went from $2700 yesterday, to $11,800 currently. All done using just $900 of the original $2700. I have friends that are FA's, a friend with a Masters in Finance from Nova, and another with a Masters in econ from Carnegie Mellon... They all call me an idiot for trading weeklys and FD's. I have a 401k and a roth for a retirement. Options are my lottery ticket, and in 14 months, they have helped me buy a home, pay off my credit card debt, and pay my car balance down to $1500, outperforming my retirement funds by probably 50 fold. So much love to this community for teaching me what options are.|2021-05-11 14:16:51

xqm7ti|n9th6n|n9th6n|3|This shit's going down HARD. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But if you think we can print our way to prosperity you're fucking retarded. The Fed is juggling nuclear warheads inside a volcano, trying to manage every dip in the market with its constant jawboning. Look around. Every fucking chart looks exactly the same. That's a dangerous bubble. In the end, Austrian economics always wins. The crash has been put off for 15 years. It will be hard, stagflationary, and it will clean out these zombies and purge this circus so that people outside the top 10% can finally afford to buy assets. Bulls are fuck|2021-05-11 10:27:29

xreb0z|n9th6n|n9th6n|1|From Jan 2020 to Feb 2021 I was up 813,000  Feb 2021 to now Down 498,000; still up 315,000 overall  I am playing the market entirely differently now.  I am focusing on beleaguered stocks and making moves in a very simple way.  I am buying a large quantity of a company that I would be willing to hold long-term, but getting out once I make a reasonable profit.  I'm also not playing options for a while due to this.  Case in point:  Bought BABA x 1000 shares at 217, sold at 220 for 3000 profit today.  Stocks I'm looking to make similar plays on:  BABA if it drops below 217  BA below 215  DIS below 180 with earnings coming up  Examples of moves I feel are fairly safe in terms of holding long-term if you have to.  **Any other examples would be more than welcome.**|2021-05-11 13:40:30

xqm26d|n9th6n|n9th6n|-1|investors are disregarding the fact that stocks are very expensive right now, said Kee, who last November predicted a 25% drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA ￼ by year-end based on high price/earnings multiples  Last year, he expected Dow earnings-per-share growth at 32% for 2021, but now sees it surging to 62%, before collapsing to 2.42% in 2022  The declines can be much worse than 25% and if the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] is handcuffed because of inflation, the swift bounce back that investors have been used to will not happen either,” said Kee. “The fair value multiple on the SPX SPX ￼ is not 30 – [to] 35x. It’s more like 15x.  And the price/earnings to growth ratio, which adds in future earnings growth, for the Dow next year is “over 7, and normal fair value is 1.5. It is way overvalued based on that,” said Kee  (My personal opinion on this is that it will come much sooner, more like 2021 3rd quarter, the economy has been help up artificially to long. The train that crashed into the wall never blew up on 3/20/20 it magically kept going because the government has a printing machine)  Safe Haven that will only see an increase and where wealthy individuals will transfer their money if they decide to stay in healthy stocks -BNTX  -Pfizer  -JNJ -GLW  -MRK 🦍🤓💁‍♂️|2021-05-11 10:26:24

xq5zuy|n9th6n|n9th6n|1|Wondering the following (someone’s post from another board):  learned from a trader friend of mine that the algorithm's setup on the markets will calculate available shares along with a number of other signifcant calculations like average shares being purchased at different amounts over a period. But, basically if 60-80% of shares were being put on an ask of (example $.60 or more) then the shorts would start covering in preparation for a possible run up to avoid losses.  If that’s true why not do this?  Edit: could be more than just $0.60|2021-05-11 08:28:02

Largest U.S. domestic suppliers of Soybean Oil, canola, sunflower, corn oil etc.  There are limited supplies of Soybean Oil until the new crop comes out end of Q3 early Q4.  Currently their price on Soybean has gone up to $1+ It used to be .45/lb. Not only are they monopolizing current sales of cooking/frying oil, they are crushing it with corn based fuels.

xq1vpq|n9th6n|n9th6n|-1|Couple of insights on ACB for today. Obviously it took a very brutal beating in premarket. A bank downgraded it, the S&P is down, and TLRY had a not very great earnings report. The important thing to recognize is that this is all artificially affecting ACB in the negative. I'm going to be using today to average down some shares and calls and pull in some calls at a lower strike. I'm certainly still bullish on ACB, the company is getting its shit together under new management, has licenses to operate in multiple countries exclusively, etc. I'm not overly concerned by an artificial price drop.|2021-05-11 07:52:48

But, basically if 60-80% of shares were being put on an ask of (example $.60 or more) then the shorts would start covering in preparation for a possible run up to avoid losses.  Why not do this?
