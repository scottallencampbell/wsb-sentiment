fvrjly|vx7j8b|vx7j8b|8|Going out on a limb and guessing there's substantially more upside than downside opportunity in the headline CPI figures tomorrow, which will be predictably bad. We and the White House know this because EIA figures are showing a 59% YoY increase June gas prices vs 48% in May. Likewise, the 75 bps rate hike is going to happen as a combination of that and the jobs report. All of this in my view is already priced in.    With that said, any moderation in core CPI will be tremendous, not because of an immediate impact, but because it removes substantial uncertainty from the market, which has been grappling with two critical questions. 1) Will energy prices moderate? Answer appears to be yes given the massive declines in the last 4 weeks 2) Are rate hikes an effective tool to moderate all things non-energy? Unclear at this time, but any clarity here will then lock-in the calendar and spur a hop in the equities market|2022-07-12 12:29:50

There is a hope that with CPI, GOOG earnings, and GDP, all of these will drag down and break ~~resistance~~ support. If that happens, then the profitability becomes nicer, but it still can never go stellar, because the contracts are around $7500 each right now. So even if it drops 225 past resistance, that's 340%.

fvs5jw|vx7j8b|vx7j8b|4|STILL NO MOVEMENT: On Wednesday, which just happened to be the international pot holiday 4/20, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), the third-highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, at a news conference said she was committed to passing the SAFE Banking Act, formally the the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act.        “It makes absolutely no sense that legal cannabis businesses are being forced to operate entirely in cash," she said. "It’s dangerous -- and sometimes even fatal -- for the employees behind the register, but this situation is also completely preventable.        "I’ve been pushing the federal government -- particularly my Republican colleagues -- to catch up with Washington state. I am working to update our laws so that these legal small businesses have a safe way to do business.     "I am urging every one of my colleagues to come together so that we can finally pass the SAFE Banking Act.”|2022-07-12 12:33:48

It’s not like he’s constantly giving buy / sell recommendations on everything he’s ever opined on.  For example he said Netflix was a buy in January but I’m sure he changed his mind by March yet everyone benchmarks the performance to the current day since he never specifically tweeted about it again|2022-07-12 05:35:36

fw41xu|vx7j8b|vx7j8b|2|When I was in Boy Scouts, we used to make char cloth in Altoid tins. We'd cut up small bits of cotton shirts or blue jeans and place them in the tin, then poke a small hole in the top by tapping a nail. If we put this tin on the coals of a fire, it would "cook" the cotton scraps. We took the tin off the fire the moment smoke stopped coming from the little hole on top, but it was important that we didn't open the small box until it had completely cooled. When we did, there was our char cloth: the ideal tinder. I started fires during raging hurricanes with the stuff. Such a small thing, made from unwanted leftovers, but with great care, could start a bonfire.  I know it's been raining hard, friends. But maybe it's time to open our tin, and with a couple unwanted shares and calls, we could start a fire.|2022-07-12 13:53:34

If the fine is, say, $3B, that’s a 12% bump.  Seems like long dated calls are miss prices. The Jan 23 50c are only $0.70 which means odds of the deal going through are about 1/6 to break even (0 chance it hits that price otherwise).

Interest rates take the highest uptick in half a century. BUT.. If you did have some money right around this time it would be a decent time to buy for the hopes that rising unemployment from massive layoffs to improve earnings would slow the Fed’s inflationary control efforts. Interest rates might after this year lock in at 3% as unemployment rises above its target. You might just catch the perfect bottom.
