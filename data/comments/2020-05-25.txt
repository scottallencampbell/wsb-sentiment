If approved, the fund would cover half of visitor’s travel expenses, and would work to offset a 99.9% decrease in visitors from April 2019 to April 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

rskud8|gq8jvr|gq8jvr|4|My entire bear thesis is based on what little I remember of the [first mover advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage?wprov=sfla1) in game theory(or some variation of a cooperation game I can't pinpoint).   Basically, if everyone is anticipating a terrible Q2 then it behooves responsible actors to pull back a bit before then to preserve tendies. The problem is if you expect others to pull out too, then it's best to pull back just before others for max tendies. But what if they're thinking the same thing? Waiting until the week of big earning is potentially disastrous if you're last. So do you start a week out, two weeks, a month, or keep a trigger finger ready to follow the first big boy to bail out?  This foward looking scenario will likely start in early June once current earnings are forgotten. The real paper hands won't happen until early July when Q2s start trickling in and real fear sets in.  SPY 250? No. But when the first big mover acts, the drop will be large and sudden.  TWM shares in late June because timing is a bitch.|2020-05-25 13:51:16

Basically he said that when something important that was good for society was getting done, in England you'd find an Aristocrat, in France you'd find the Government. In America you'd find a club (basically nonprofits).  Voluntary association is what makes America unique. Our ability to come together to form societies, charities, non-profits, clubs, and organizations and more effectively acquire and utilize shared resources is something that many other countries lack.

rrsy8d|gq8jvr|gq8jvr|3|Reading princes of the yen (highly reccomend) - learned that in the early 1970s the Bank of Japan essentially created a bubble economy (also in asset prices) because they increased credit creation quotas significantly in anticipation of a negative shock to their exports due to the peg of Yen to USD failing after the gold standard was abolished. Basically the BoJ massively overestimated the negative consequences and turned on the money printers (via increasing credit creation through window guidance) and thus a massive bubble was born. It is possible something similar could happen with the FED today assuming there is a quick-ish bounce back in economic activity. The key indicator that is happening is if there is a significant increase in non productive loans. Something to keep in mind.|2020-05-25 09:47:12

The prefs are trading at less than a buck (CBL.PD, CBL.PE) and although dividends are suspended (but accruing), there is talk of debt restructure- all their secured debt is to insiders. While I’m bearish on retail/malls in general, this company has too many viable ways to stay in business (they’ve redeveloped plenty of empty boxes in their malls already). There’s plenty not to like but I think anything other than BK sets this up for a big pop upwards.

rsjebn|gq8jvr|gq8jvr|1|Question about SPAC warrants....  tl;dr: When shareholders of SPACs vote to extend a deadline for a business combo, does this extend warrants?  Example: Was looking at LACQ(W) and they've voted a couple times to extend, with December 2019 being the original deadline. The warrant ticker's full name says Expires December 2019. Are these truly worthless now, or is that expiration date in the name just not updated? From reading the SEC filings, I don't see why the warrants would be void. Expiring in 2019 would have been based on failure to combine, not the original exercise window.  Thank yall|2020-05-25 13:38:46

And while we expect the complete obliteration of a person’s former identity to primarily affect adults, we know that there could be mysterious disappearances of children as young as 12.”  **^(This is a satire news)**|2020-05-25 14:04:56
