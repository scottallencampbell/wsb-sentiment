There are also articles about Microsoft pressuring companies to use Teams instead of Slack.  On the app store Teams has more downloads than Slack and 250k more reviews. Teams is one of Microsoft's fastest-growing offerings and my company recently switched to it.  Since Microsoft is a trillion-dollar company, good Teams numbers will not move the needle.

I predict they're going to gradually stop doing any, and that the stock market will just have to deal with that. This is based on Kaplan's comments to the WSJ on the 15th. "Many market participants believe that growth in the Fed balance sheet is supportive of higher valuations and risk assets. I'm sympathetic to that concern. I think it's wise to acknowledge it and be cognizant of that concern as we think about our next actions."  "The Fed balance sheet is not free and growing the balance sheet has costs.

fwvem1|evlh1t|evlh1t|3|Interest on Excess Reserves (IOER) might go up a little bit today to 1.6%. IOER has only been paid since 2008 as an effort to combat/recover from recession.  I receive 1.6% interest payments for my Ally savings, because that money is actually being used by the bank to write loans. A bank's excess cash reserves are being used for nothing at all, they're just not in circulation, yet they're still being given interest by the Fed.  Was this seriously the only workable method to get banks to hold adequate cash reserves, was for them to be offered free money? This looks a whole lot like widespread, massive subsidization of the private banking industry at taxpayer expense, and it makes me fucking sick.
