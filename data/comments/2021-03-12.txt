qoilkb|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|12|Good morning contrarians!  Stop me if you’ve heard this before: Technology stocks are selling off as bond yields are rising. Yes, we’re back to that narrative.   As of 0620 Nasdaq futures are 1.6% lower. The S&P 500 is pointing to a drop of 0.5% at the open. Dow Industrials and small caps are flat. Commodities are lower: gold and silver down more than 1% and 2%, respectively. Copper down over 1% as well.  This all comes after the S&P 500 climbed to a record yesterday. Seeing how there is nothing else that has really emerged as a catalyst, this would lead one to surmise that the drop is due to profit taking. Though again, the fact that bonds are selling off as well is unusual.  Not much in the way of data releases today: PPIs at 0830. You’ll be hearing about the Michigan Consumer Sentiment but that is a backward-looking measure I have never found particularly useful.  In the absence of anything else (at least that I’m seeing) this could be another buying opportunity.|2021-03-12 05:46:40

qomeb5|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|11|.....according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.  “We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.”  Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.)  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html|2021-03-12 06:36:21

qov6yo|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|13|Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this revenue.|2021-03-12 08:04:47

qpzz1q|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|13|Buying PLTR weeklies is stupid, if you want to cash in on PLTR buy shares, LEAPs, or calls that expire at least a month from now. It’s not a big short-term mover but I’m very bullish on PLTR in the long-term (6-18 months)  People talk about PLTR like they have a clue about what the company actually does, I’ve seen people saying their revenue from government contracts doesn’t have much room to grow. No clue where that thesis came from, PLTR is just getting started when it comes to government contracts, there is a shit-ton of room to grow, not to mention they have barely tapped their commercial potential. it’s not a cheap stock, but the potential for growth is massive.|2021-03-12 13:16:52

We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.  -JFK|2021-03-12 06:25:31

qq2d82|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|9|Id like some feedback on this opinion. Most people will not put their stimulus into the market. The bottom is getting money and they will spend it on shit they want/need. A very small percentage is going to buy stocks/options with it. The stimulus we had last year pumped the market because the top got mad tax breaks and they aren't going to spend it on stuff they want cause they already have everything they want. They also won't pay their workers more because minimum wage is just fine and dandy. No it went straight into the stock market. Give rich money stonks go up. Give poor money and they buy shit.

However, those payments phase out quickly for incomes above $75,000 for single taxpayers, above $112,500 for taxpayers filing as head of household, and above $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.  ...  Overall, such payments are expect to cost about **$410 billion** through 2030 according to the Congressional Budget Office."     "A Deutsche Bank survey of 430 retail investors last month found that on average they plan to put **37%** of any stimulus checks directly into equities."     37% of $410 billion = **$151.7 billion** will be going into a bucket of like $85 trillion     $151.7 billion of new bags about to be held|2021-03-12 13:37:15

qoogx5|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|13|Johnson noted that yesterday someone brought 44,845 weekly GME Mar 12, 2021 call strike options for ~$2.34 that have a delta of 0.046. This was a $10.5 million bet that GME stock would be over $800 in two days... that's correct two days.  https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18113374&gfv=1  ....according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.  “We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.”  Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.)  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html|2021-03-12 06:59:54

qq3rls|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|4|I've been meaning to do some DD on RIDE for a while now, I've been on it since pre spac days and am LONG. No time for the DD now (maybe someone has already done one) but I'm telling you that this Hindenberg report was some serious BULLSHIT. Someone paid them for that because they had calls in the 15+ range expiring they they wanted to make worthless.  As we speak, there has been a battle to keep it below $15. Looks like RIDE just broke through, but the activity on it today is NOT normal. I've been following this stock literally since before its inception. There is a reason rating agencies (I think Morgan Stanley, iirc) recently downgrated RIDE and why the Hindenberg report dropped this morning. Hedge funds/big money/MM/whoever want this stock down and calls not to print.  My point is: BUY $RIDE (if you like the stock) and if you want to RIDE the return to $30 and beyond. $15 for RIDE is ridiculous. It's the only yet-to-sell-a-car US-based EV company that will be rolling thousands of units off the lines THIS YEAR. In a former GM plant (company has HUGE GM backing/investment, I think it owns 30%) in the fuckin heartland of the US (which makes the company's badass name even more badass--it's actually the name of the city). LORD'Stown. i.e. God's Country. Rep. Tim Ryan is fighting for them, the plant is in his district; it will revitalize the area as it expands. Joe Fuckin' Burrow as the company spokesman, need I say more!!? Blue and Red America are uniting on this RIDE, folks. Hop upon the RIDE to American EV dominance glory.  $RIDE 12/17/21 $20c, 3/26 $24c, many shares (many redeemed from warrants)  Edit: typo fixed so can read more good|2021-03-12 13:46:10

qonksa|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|8|.....according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.  “We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.”  Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.)  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html|2021-03-12 06:50:00

qot15e|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|23|Isn't it weird how GME feels almost like a pyramid scheme? Some people get in on it early, and now they're advocating for it non-stop. Others join in, and then they're advocating for everyone they know to buy the stock too, hoping they're high enough up to profit from the people below.  I think there's a strong emotional appeal being made to people here as well. Look how they rally up your emotions, making it seem like it's everyone vs. the hedge funds or the 99% vs the 1%. I do think there's some truth to this, but it mostly feels like people are being emotionally manipulated for someone else's profit. Look at how much people are using this new sense of community to make you feel like you belong, if only you buy and hold the stock.  I love everyone here, but I'm worried about more people buying into GME and losing their money. The people who are going to suffer most when GME crashes are going to be the people of WSB--the ones who bought in at the wrong time. The hedge funds won't suffer because they're not people, and the people working at them won't suffer either because we know they're already well off.  Before this stock was chosen as the official meme stock, remember how everyone used to make fun of GameStop? I think I've heard at least a thousand jokes about how people trade in hundreds of dollars worth of games only to get 25 cents in GameStop credit. I think one reason it's such a good stock is because everyone already knows about the company, especially with all young people who play video games on Reddit.  Something seems off about everything happening in WSB right now. I know this is fun, but I think this could have terrible consequences for real people and their families. Be careful with your money.|2021-03-12 07:45:25

When yields hit their inevitable 2%, (what made us have the tech correction in the first place), there’s going to be a full out bear market. Even if re-opening goes well... tech will tank 15-20% bringing this entire market to the ground. 2% yields are gonna fuck this shit up bad. Oh, stimulus is on the way?

My DD post from a few days ago on this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m225xd/lumn\_lumen\_technologies\_should\_have\_a\_lot\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m225xd/lumn_lumen_technologies_should_have_a_lot_more/)  LUMN is stuck in a very important support/resistance channel of the past 4 years, if it breaks out above $15-16, it can run to $25 very fast.  The big question is how high do yields go?  If yields go up to 2.5-3%, I think LUMN will be a huge winner over the next year even as the high growth tech moves more sideways-ish.|2021-03-12 09:10:19

qpwfih|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|2|Is there some program than exist that would tell you what stocks are having big premarket dips? I feel like many stocks that dip tends to go back up to at least recover, unless its trending down, i feel like it would be a great way to look at them, look at their charts and if they have that same habit of being dumped periodicaly and recover intraday (or at least get back on the trending line) .   I may be wrong but it does it daily and also weekly (which I wouldnt know how to track) but if there was a tool that could tell you which premarket dips are highest i feel it would be a good starting point to gain on daily recoveries with limited risks. If anyone have an idea to play the same way for bit longer recoveries could be good to know to.  **edit added some stuff|2021-03-12 12:49:50

qpyoz2|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|5|CNBC is so fucking stupid man lol. They’ll spin any story, any catalyst, any way just to “make sense” of the market. They don’t know SHIT! It’s despicable.  “Yields rising, but investors getting used to the fact that a rise in yields is actually healthy.” Only because markets aren’t cratering.   But if they fall again, I’m sure those dipshits will say “Oh, investors really aren’t liking the yields increasing as it’s just putting so much pressure on the market and tech.”   Such a pointless show. Watch yields pop to 1.7% and they’ll be real quick to say run.|2021-03-12 13:07:00

qpflgr|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|2|No one else playing shipping?  Shipping is fucked beyond belief due to a massive container shortage.  Shipping is about to enter a historic ten year supercycle. Rates for shipping are at historic highs and just keep going up and up because of the shortage.  Shipping is also not a one off deal....companies sign long term contracts, thus the massive amount of revenue for these contracts are being locked in now and will be on balance sheets for a long time. The world has also required ships to now have low suphur emissions, which will reduce the number of available ships for shipping until they can be retrofitted with remedies for suphur emissions or new ships can be made to meet standards.  All of that takes a very long time, meaning even worse shortage and huge profits for those available to ship.  Finally, this is also against the backdrop of the largest trade deal signed in human history (RCEP) which is going to demand even more shipping for over half the planet.

qom6z6|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|-1|Is there a smart retard in the room to explain this?  'We should see the GME short squeeze continuing': S3 Partners  GameStop (GME) has already had quite the week, up almost 80% since Monday following news that board member and investor Ryan Cohen would play a key role in the business’s e-commerce strategy. Bulls expect the presence of Cohen, who founded pet goods retailer Chewy, to help the company fulfill the potential GameStop fans believe it has as it transforms from a brick-and-mortar focused business to something more modern. The GameStop bulls who see the company as an underrated, long-term value play may not be paying that much attention to the moves of the stock, but it’s hard to miss the roller-coaster ride. As the stock spiked on Wednesday, short interest continued to fall, perhaps after short-sellers learned their lesson in the late January squeeze, losing billions. But according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue. “We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.” Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.) To put this into context, fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment has a short interest percentage of float of 17.32%. Tesla, another famously shorted company, is at 5.98%, and Amazon at 1.03%. “This has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers, after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,” Dusaniwsky said. “[Wednesday’s] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional mark-to-market losses.” All in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date, Dusaniwsky said.|2021-03-12 06:33:52

qpl1jm|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|-2|Counterpoint to all the bulls saying 1.60% on rates doesn’t matter because it’s historically low: No shit. But understand that pretty much every major market downturn in history happened for reasons that seemed innocuous at the time but then turned into much larger trends. Who said there has to be a fundamental reason for a selloff? All you need with a market this stretched is a slight bump to disrupt it, which seems more and more to be the case. Once the genie is out of the bottle, it’s tough to get it back in. Tech simply is no longer in a bull market. The Nasdaq 100 is solidly in a downtrend. If you are bullish on tech, fine but know that you’re fighting a trend, despite the couple of massive up days we’ve had this week and every big rally has failed.  If you believe that the reasons for long term down trends were easy to spot at the beginning, ask yourself why so few ever sell near the top of markets.|2021-03-12 11:24:56

qpnnao|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|-14|Hey ya'll I'm new to investing stocks, so I was hoping to get some advice?? My largest investment is currently  $20 of GME, currently up a total of about $40 with a $20 gain.  Here is my issue: GME was leveling out some (well, for a day or two), today it's currently at about –7% loss  Should I sell all, sell some—or do I not sell? I'm still learning so I'm not putting up any more than I can afford; any advice related to this will be very appreciated! Thanks—I've learned a lot just from lurking here!  Also, btw, I'm also curious what ya'll think about over the weekend coming up and opening Monday?|2021-03-12 11:44:16

So I woke him up by shoving my phone with my Robinhood account in his face.  “Yeah, bitch. You see these TSLA calls?!? I’m fucking black. How many TSLA calls you got?”  He was so confused. My gf and him rolled over to face the other way and go back to sleep.  So I jumped on the bed, standing over both of them now, shoving robhinhood in both of their faces.  “Look bae! He ain’t even black bae! He ain’t even black! He doesn’t have any TSLA calls!”  They just kept sleeping. I’m not sure if it worked or not and now she probably thinks I am racist or something.|2021-03-12 06:36:08

qpagtv|m3f9fp|m3f9fp|-4|Hey guys quick story and important follow up question for you all,  I used the wrong bank account to deposit funds into Robinhood initially. This ended up with my account owing $3k~ to Robinhood. So I waited till I was at a good position to sell and I stood my stocks this morning and held on to my options. I no longer owe Robinhood any money and I have a lot of excess cash in my buying power now. But it’s saying I’m not above my margin maintenance line? Idek what that’s talking about. The line it shows on my portfolio is way below where I am anyways.  https://i.imgur.com/M0bUxjj.jpg  How do I get the ability to buy stuff again? I’m missing out on opportunities to make money. Do other apps just lock your account when they choose like this? What’s your favorite brokerage app? I’m considering switching it all over. I’ve only stayed on Robinhood because that’s where I started once upon a time.  Thanks|2021-03-12 10:06:36
