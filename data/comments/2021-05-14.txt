At least I thought I did.  I don’t know what happened, but the order never executed. I was multitasking, it was probably my own fault.  I come back to the computer a few hours later and my account is trash. The fucking put never closed and just bled out.   Fucking hate myself right now.|2021-05-14 12:52:15

y31li0|nc4z12|nc4z12|11|Futures are continuing their rally, with tech stocks leading the way. The Nasdaq is up 1.1%. Russell 2000 0.7% higher. S&P 500 0.6% to the good and Dow Industrials ahead by 0.4%. That’s as of 0625.  This follows a day of nice gains for risk assets. There was a reversal after some pre-market selling. At the close the major indexes were up 1% and change (except for the Nasdaq, which gained only 0.7%).  No immediate indication what’s driving the relief rally, but I have my ideas. You have to listen to the podcast though. Not gonna type it.  Stocks have a bunch of ground to make up to turn green for the week. Nasdaq is still down 4.6% for the week. S&P almost 3% in the red. Dow down 2%.   Couple of data releases today. Retail sales at 0830. Expectation is for a 0.8% increase in April, a major slowdown from the 9.8% advance in March. Industrial production at 0915 will shed some light on supply-chain bottlenecks.   If those reports beat estimates we should see more buying, though probably not quite enough to turn us green for the week.|2021-05-14 05:37:22

y2zoe0|nc4z12|nc4z12|74|Could be another day of ups and/or downs today, so here are some tips for you apes to stay on top of your game.  Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.  Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.  Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.  Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.  Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.  Good luck out there today, retards.|2021-05-14 05:10:40

y4hdup|nc4z12|nc4z12|23|Posting this again...  For everyone thinking about buying AMC:  **It is ten times 2016 market cap levels,**   It won't see "2019" revenue until 20**23**,  *It still has debt*, no new innovation, no new tech, no advertising, no marketing, no acquisitions, no mergers, no change in leadership, no opening new theatres, no renovating existing theatres.  People demographically in the USA have become **less and less interested in movie theatres for the last 10 years**. We are about *to potentially enter another economic downturn because of gigainflation*. Cinemas don't do well when the poors have no money.  People were opening short positions at 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 - they will need AMC to be in the 150-200 range to even begin margin calls... and either way they can *justify to their lender* that they don't have to cover. Why? BECAUSE THE STOCK IS **FUNDAMENTALLY OVERVALUED**.  Institutions can *negotiate their covenants with the lenders*. They do **not have to cover.**  If AMC wanted a squeeze, they'd have issued something to force shorts to cover. Like a dividend... or split or anything.  Instead, they have *only done everything to help shorts cover by diluting the stock*. $1,000,000,000 has been raised by AMC through stock dilutions. What has that been used for? To prevent *bankruptcy*. That isn't bullish. They *still have debt*.  Who do you think was initiating those buys yesterday? Did retail suddenly all decide in unison that yesterday was the day to go all in?  **Absolutely not.** It was sparked by an institution. Conveniently we see AMC dilute the stock *on the same day*.  AM🤡s have ***WAY*** too much faith in this company.  WAY too much man.|2021-05-14 12:41:08

y37gna|nc4z12|nc4z12|8|Everyone thinking about buying AMC:  **It is over triple 2016 market cap levels,**   It won't see "2019" revenue until 20**23**,  *It still has debt*, no new innovation, no new tech, no advertising, no marketing, no acquisitions, no mergers, no change in leadership, no opening new theatres, no renovating existing theatres.  People demographically in the USA have become **less and less interested in movie theatres for the last 10 years**. We are about *to potentially enter another economic downturn because of gigainflation*. Cinemas don't do well when the poors have no money.  People were opening short positions at 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 - they will need AMC to be in the 150-200 range to even begin margin calls... and either way they can *justify to their lender* that they don't have to cover. Why? BECAUSE THE STOCK IS **FUNDAMENTALLY OVERVALUED**.  Institutions can *negotiate their covenants with the lenders*. They do **not have to cover.**  If AMC wanted a squeeze, they'd have issued something to force shorts to cover. Like a dividend... or split or anything.  Instead, they have *only done everything to help shorts cover by diluting the stock*. $1,000,000,000 has been raised by AMC through stock dilutions. What has that been used for? To prevent *bankruptcy*. That isn't bullish.   Who do you think was initiating those buys yesterday? Did retail suddenly all decide in unison that yesterday was the day to go all in?  **Absolutely not.** It was sparked by an institution. Conveniently we see AMC dilute the stock *on the same day*.  AM🤡s have ***WAY*** too much faith in this company.  WAY too much man.|2021-05-14 06:46:49

So the last call was a nightmare. I have to imagine that Tony does not want a repeat of that.   Moving up the date of the call and ratcheting up social media posts is a very good sign.   We will get the guidance we have patiently waited for.   If not GOEV will end up only trading at about 1.5 X cash on hand.   Let’s not forget that GOEV is heavily shorted and a catalyst could really give the share price a nice bump.   Times like this are not for the faint of heart.|2021-05-14 09:27:12

y3w3r9|nc4z12|nc4z12|1|people keep talking about a correction but we pretty sure it already happened in Feb-March. There was massive rotation back into value.  &#x200B;  The reason the market keeps going up overall is because more people are putting money in than ever before and traditional non-stock investment vehicles are falling out of favor. Which is pretty standard. Pretty much every generation has gone through a shift, our grandparents for the most part just retired with pensions. After that it was primarily bonds.  &#x200B;  More than a correction, I'm just worried about what happens when nobody wants to put their money in bonds to cover government debt.|2021-05-14 10:09:32

So, I run into him a week later in the mall and he's buying another cat. And I says to him, "Jesus, Walt! What are you doing? You know you're just gonna get this cat stuck up your ass too. Why don't you knock it off?" And he said to me, "How the hell else am I supposed to get the gerbil out?" My cousin was a weird guy.|2021-05-14 13:11:02

Nokia grew by more than 10% last year, acquiring over 25% market share to gain the top position in India’s optical networks market, according to the recent Omdia report on market share analysis. Nokia's comprehensive and innovative product portfolio coupled with its strong presence in the country has enabled it to consistently increase its share in the optical networks.  &#x200B;  https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/05/13/nokia-ranked-1-in-indias-optical-networks-market-by-omdia/|2021-05-14 11:38:18

y4q0jo|nc4z12|nc4z12|0|Thoughts on TTCF?  Looking at the company they seem like an absolutely magnificent buy either way, stupidly good fundamentals, the story, the progress, everything's there.  But there's more than just the fantastic opportunity for long term gains (my target price is 85-100 within the next 4-5 years).  They're getting shorted right now, and the amount of shorting has increased A LOT around that stock recently. IF this goes on, dare I say, there MIGHT be a SLIGHT chance for a SHORT SQUEEZE.  I'm  in the company for the long term, huge believer in them, but this might be the icing on the cake.  Full disclosure: I own 187 shares @ 18 right now, which is quite a big position for me, especially for such a small market cap. However, if it goes down a bunch, I may add to that position.|2021-05-14 13:43:18

If we have a GROUP EXIT STRATEGY for say $850.00, we could have enough loyalty to actually pull this off. At $850, the shorts would be long gone which is another reason why it'll never see 4 digits. Let's be real.  That's what will make the squeeze happen. Don't be ridiculous. This is really not a game, but let's play this one, and there will certainly be another.  APES TO $850.  BAND TOGETHER. DO IT FOR REAL! APES TO $850!|2021-05-14 12:34:03

I had two Calls @ 411 on the SPY exp today bought them both for $2.67 a few days ago and set a limit order of$2.69 yesterday (haha...i remember this so clearly AND the confirmation because it was .69) I went out for the day after setting the order then got a message saying it filled at $2.13 at a loss.....I never typed in $2.13 and somehow it got filled at that.....it wasn't the lock button because at that time the market price was well below $2.13...it was at $1.80 (i placed the order at 10:35 CST if you want to check the chart)   TD has hung up on me three times and keeps saying they consider this resolved.   I NEVER TYPED IN THE NUMBER 2.13 YET MY LIMIT ORDER WAS EXECUTED AT THIS PRICE WTF?!?   TD has told me to step out in the middle of the street and bend over and accept this resolution but I cannot swallow accepting a limit order that I never placed.   anyone else?!?

y4wxmz|nc4z12|nc4z12|1|Does anyone know or have a link to an explanation of how a **share recount** works logistically and how it's possible to know if we have synthetic shares and to what degree? Why can't they just look at records from brokerages to see how many positions are held at each and add them up? Does this rely on shareholders voting? What happens if there are more than 496M shares after they count? If there are a billion shares does AMC buy them back? Do brokerages get forced to **margin call ALL AMC SHARES** across the entire market? If there is a historical precedent (or many) I would love to read up on it as I can't find anything.

yafa5h|nc4z12|nc4z12|1|Friday, May 14, 2021, 11:00 pm  Maravai LifeSciences, MRVI - is the IBD Stock Of The Day.  It's almost over folks. When IBD is touting your stock the retail crowd is already being informed. It's only a matter of time when this one runs away.  My analysis says this is a 100x grower, (most recent Q was 191%), trading at a 34 PE.  If you were JNJ or PFE, what would you pay for this stock that provides a service for your mRNA and CART drugs?  Do the math. Not much time left. It either continues growing on its own and runs on fundamentals or gets taken out by a much larger customer or competitor.|2021-05-15 23:00:38
