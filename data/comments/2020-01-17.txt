en7kgh|epyz0g|epyz0g|5|2020: Party Like It‚Äôs 1999? Excerpted from the IMA fourth quarter 2019 letter to clients.  The stock market marched higher for the year even though US companies as a whole did not become more valuable, just more expensive, as earnings failed to grow from 2018 to 2019. Earnings are estimated to be up about 5% for 2020 (though these estimates are usually revised down as the year progresses). If you look at the quality of this non-growth, then the rose-tinted glasses of the average stock market investor quickly prove inadequate. Corporate debt is up 5% in 2019, and a good chunk of the increase went into stock buybacks. As stocks become more expensive their benefit from earnings per share growth diminishes.  The US economy grew about 4% in 2019 ‚Äì good news, except that our national debt grew about 5.6%, or about $1.3 trillion; our debt to GDP is over 100%; and paradoxically, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped from 2.6% to 1.9%. Maybe not paradoxically: The Federal Reserve went from a faint attempt of quantitative tightening (it did not even raise rates, it just talked about raising them) starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, which caused stock market to have a mini crash a year ago, to quantitative easing in the second half of 2019, which arguably caused the market to go up.|2020-01-17 10:31:44

The whole purpose of the rate cuts and the QE is to try to accelerate inflation! Instead we still have barely any fucking inflation. Certainly not wage inflation. The only prices inflating are fucking stock prices and they're inflating at an alarming rate. It's extremely unfair to the American people. And don't say it's good for everyone's 409k. You have to be an old ass boomer to withdraw that money. Everyone else buying in today just gets to buy at a shit PE ratio, then watch it correct and it'll take years and years for them to break even.     Do you guys want to do 1999 again? Is that what you fucking want?
