i36sp7|kq6j3j|kq6j3j|4|So, for the smart autists among us -   FED has said they still don't plan on raising interest rates until 2023 (as of 2 weeks ago), but inflation hit 2% today. Seems like the market bubble is going to keep going for the forseeable future. How are you hedging? metals, cryp-to, etc. ? or just still going in on calls since stonks only go up?  Edit: also meant to add - I think I remember Powell mentioning they would keep inflation at or around 2% once it hits that. Meaning they would be print “less” or maybe just buying less bonds. Not sure if that’s still the case, or if that even happens but would be curious long term now the market reacts (if at all)|2021-01-04 11:49:48

i3fax6|kq6j3j|kq6j3j|3|From a real Benzinga article today.   “Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 123.93 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 70.28 of the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. Ideally, one might believe that Advanced Micro Devices Inc. might perform better in the future than it’s industry group, but it’s probable that the stock is overvalued. “|2021-01-04 12:55:21

You cannot have more status quo certainty than a totally deadlocked government. If Republicans own the senate, and dems own the rest, almost nothing but the most mundane, milquetoast policies will pass. This alleviates any uncertainty.  I think the whole election theft thing Trump has been running with has turned off a ton of Republican voters for tomorrow, making them think there's no point as it'll "just be stolen anyways".

If you’ve been under a rock for the past 20 years, Gamestop is a shit business model that has slowly been eating itself alive. I rarely if ever see any positive press about it.   So what if a new console came out? Who gives a fuck. Best Buy, Target, hell, every other big store name sells games. The new consoles are even trying to push digital games on us, so where does that leave places like Gamestop? I guess they can sell more Funko pops or some shit.  If you bought GME for any reason other than a quick pump and dump at the console release, then you are a fool.|2021-01-04 11:32:04

i3567x|kq6j3j|kq6j3j|2|This is pre-poll jitters. Same thing happened in November. There’s some Iran-Israel fears mixed in for good measure, but Iran are probably not stupid enough to cross the line less than two weeks before Biden (who would be expected to be more reasonable than Trump) moves into the Oval Office. Seizing the South Korean tanker and leaking their uranium enrichment targets is a “look at what we can do, you better pay attention to us during your first week” play.   So the main thing that will move markets this week is Georgia. Thing is after watching the markets through one Brexit referendum, endless UK Brexit drama, the following Uk general election and one US Presidential election I have firmly concluded that markets are **** at politics. I don’t know whether it’s the fact that traders don’t follow it or the algos aren’t programmed correctly or some other factor, but it’s clear that markets can’t properly price the likely outcome of political events - they either don’t interpret the data correctly or view the outcome as too binary or both. If the Democrats win then markets may react negatively in the short term, anticipating more tax rises and regulation of big tech before remembering that a majority of one doesn’t beat the filibuster and that an evenly divided Senate will revolve around moderate Republicans rather than the left of the Democratic Party.|2021-01-04 11:37:16

And while watching MT stagnate at $23 for two fucking weeks and watching the option price go down, I kept buying back in to bring the average cost down. I felt like shit the entire time, checking my account 100 times a day, even during Christmas.   The option price peaked at .47 this morning and I sold right at that very tip. Broke even.   MT ain't going to 30 by 2/19. Maybe 25, but I'm done with MT. Good luck to those still holding on.|2021-01-04 10:15:59

Assumed at first it was just low liquidity, but decided to try and close my position anyways since it is slightly in my favor. The bid never goes through. Thought it was just robin hood being robin hood, but noticed on several sites, there are no bids or asks for that option. Yet I put in the ask this morning, and still never shows in the bid book.

i2qujw|kq6j3j|kq6j3j|-14|My buddy made steak for dinner last night. First time I've had it in a good while. I usually like medium well. Anyway, I added some extra seasoning to the meat and we had some potatoes too. Maybe what, 20min or so after the meat consumption my stomach was rumbling like crazy. Now being the good friend that I am, I held that bad boy in, couple rumbles here and there but no toxic release which felt like the right thing to do. After I went home later that night I had a little more to eat and home something to drink. Finally let everything release and felt amazing. Fast forward to trade time and I had to take a nice dump. Super smelly but again, felt good. Hopefully the meat decay isn't causing this foul odor that just seems to cut through the air. Should I detox or something? Or will this all pass?|2021-01-04 09:42:39
