wpivze|yxnbwi|yxnbwi|5|I think vix has been weird lately because generally institutional investors have been hedging their long positions with puts, because stocks were still the only game in town they didn't really want to sell, just to insulate themselves from "temporary" downswings.   But now a days, instead of hedging I think they are just selling shares to free up some cash to buy bonds with as they wait for this market to bottom out. Eventually we will see waves of bankruptcies on companies that cannot survive with high interest rates, and those shares are going to be super cheap. Kinda like what buffet did in 2008 with things like apple. Its a good idea to have some spare cash and to not be over leveraged so they can position themselves for the next 10+ years.   Inflation in the rest of the world is even worse than it is in the US, while their wage growth also is stagnant. China is continually shutting down big portions of their economy and manufacturing sector which will squeeze their own economic growth and also keep fucking the global supply chain. As inflation erodes the other currencies faster than it erodes the USD, dollar strength will continue to increase which will fuck up our ability to export goods and services.   We could see 420+ again or even higher before we bottom, and maybe we don't even dip below 390 again for months, but this bubble hasn't really popped yet and global central banks cannot afford to relax interest rates for a long time. The 0% interest rates we had for so long will, in my opinion, never be seen again. It was an experiment that failed and is currently in the processes of blowing up.|2022-11-17 05:34:52

I got fucking destroyed last week, my $2000 turned into about a hundred bucks after cpi came out. Just yesterday uploaded another $500 to my account and bought AAPL $145 puts before close yesterday. Premarket had me thinking I was finally gonna win a little. And now I've lost almost all of it again. What the actual fuck is up with this stock, why's it mooning? It went from being down $3 to being up $2.40. This must be the one stock that is never ever ever fucking allowed to tank. The rare times it does go down, it does so in such a slow way that puts don't even print that much. Then it fucking rockets back up like its a crypto or something. What's up with this fucking stock? I need to ban myself from trading AAPL. Holy fucking shit. And yes, I'm just mad and ranting. But FUCK this shit.|2022-11-17 12:19:29

wrg5v6|yxnbwi|yxnbwi|4|I think the biggest difference between people who are just gambling and people who are capable of trading for a living, is NOT over trading. Some days I'll scalp like 10 times for a hundred or two at a time. That wasn't today, because I had no idea what was going to happen and there were no solid trend lines that seemed to establish. I patiently waited until we hit the 3 day resistance line and then took a larger position than I normally do, sold for like 10% profit and I'm likely done for the day. If we go down to the 390-389 range I will get into some calls, and if we push back up into the resistance line I will buy some puts again.   But really, we are currently in no mans land, and its a pretty tight range spy is making and I'd be surprised if we move out of the 394-390, maybe even 393-390 now as we break down through there. Thats a pretty tight range and there isn't much money to be made on a .5-.75% range. I could easily be wrong but thats what it seems like to me.  TLDR: Dont over trade, wait for a good entry point even if it means sitting on your hands and doing nothing for the day as you stare at your bar chart.|2022-11-17 14:08:55

All of his donations went to the Republicans.  https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/top_donors/2022?disp=D&type=V&superonly=N  These guys are legit sociopaths. He admitted pretty much every conspiracy theory people have ever had about evil, cynical rich people running the world. (He later said he didn't realize that his friend would publish the messages.) He doesn't care about poor people. He doesn't care about altruism. He thinks politicians/regulators are morons. All the money was just to bribe politicians/regulators. All the altruism stuff was just PR. His only goal was to make as much money as humanly possible at everyone else's expense.  https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy|2022-11-17 11:47:21

wqj1ql|yxnbwi|yxnbwi|6|MM playbook, chapter 37, section 4.a.3.   "How to trick retail into becoming option writers"  First, need to hold the market entirely flat, with an allowable slippage of 1-2% for a single trading session to begin with.   Second, make planned jumps overnight so that daytime trading is range locked.   Third, repeat for multiple trading sessions in a row.   Fourth, retail becomes enamoured with writing options contracts for sale, both covered and naked, in an attempt to partake in the theta premium.   Fifth, stomp them all out and collect on their positions.|2022-11-17 10:31:29

wpm26p|yxnbwi|yxnbwi|4|After getting pushed down below 400 and then below 395, I have a hard time believing we won't be re testing 390 again. Had a hard bounce on 389 and then melted up all the way to 400 basically.   I will short today around 395 for a few weeks out that I'll be willing to diamond hand but will take profits if they gain enough value.   I will buy a small call position if we get to 390, double down at 389, and sell for like a 50%+ loss if we keep dropping. Today should be lit though with 2% intraday swings as people decide what all this new information means. If we stay between 395 and 390 I will sit on my hand and do nothing most likely. If we establish some solid trends, maybe do a bit of scalping in the middle of the day but likely won't be taking any positions in the first few hours unless we hit my numbers.|2022-11-17 06:11:48

wrbtmp|yxnbwi|yxnbwi|3|Question to the option professionals here.  The concept of max pain suggests it's in the interest of option sellers to get as much money as they can from the expiry as options as worthless - thus either correctly choosing where the market/stock price will end up (or even potentially manipulating it with large trades to be at a certain point at a certain time - a concept I have less faith in).  Now here's my question: is there any evidence for this? Like academic evidence, economics institutes that sort of thing.   For example I've heard people talking about put/call ratio, but when I spent a few hours looking to try and find evidence for that,  all the papers suggested it has no predictive power at all.|2022-11-17 13:40:15

wr52dh|yxnbwi|yxnbwi|4|So i see that SQQQ has 155 million in volume already today.  QQQ has 32 million  This Fund tracks the QQQ by placing swap bets and using futures contracts.   These are the most insane market pumping tool mankind has ever seen  It is totally possible to sell options contracts on an index and then flood TQQQ with money.   This would essentially cause large primes to hedge those swaps and move the market in either direction.   The volume difference between the index and the leveraged product is insane.   With purchases of the underlying occurring this makes it seem like TQQQ and SQQQ are up and down buttons for the nasdaq lol|2022-11-17 12:55:34

Every cycle they dig themselves into a deeper hole and gorge on credit and bad debt and when it all goes bust they blame anybody and everybody but themselves. Bankers, immigrants, billionaires, regulators, corporations, politicians, China, Russia, whoever, but never do they point the finger where ultimate responsibility lies: right back at themselves.  Retail bought FTX tokens without any due diligence after seeing Tom Brady commercials and are now suing Tom Brady for being in the commercial.
