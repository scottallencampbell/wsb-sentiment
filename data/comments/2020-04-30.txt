They have an uncanny track record of getting drugs to market, and fast. Their efficiency is unmatched. They are a unicorn with unlimited potential yet still managing to return a profit. Their R&D is half the size of big pharma yet consistently outperforms them. Tenofovir and Sovaldi were absolute breakthroughs. I believe their best is yet to come."*  Like wtf reading that gave me chills. Dude was a complete genius. The greatest biotech trading mind of all time.

p1r7v6|gaszeo|gaszeo|43|Everything is totally fine, everyone.  Our President is handling the situation amazingly. Better than any other leader on Earth. The response has been massive, unlike any response anywhere, to anything. Our leaders are so strong, the Magnificent Pence literally doesn't need to wear a mask. He has the strongest immune system in the world.  The stock market is still booming. The meat sweatshops continue humming with meat. The toilet paper factories are pumping out paper almost as fast as our magnificent Federal Reserve Bank.  Only 25%-30% percent are unemployed, and they're all going back to work soon! Many excellent governors are opening up their states, and these unemployed will roll up their sleeves and get back to work. They're well taken care of and received their $1,200 checks. It's safe now that we stopped the spread of the virus, and people will stay 6 feet apart from each other.  Mission Accomplished – only a million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and about 60,000 dead. Pretty much just like the seasonal flu that goes around every year. There is nothing to be worried about! The situation is so under control, we don't even need to continue testing. In fact, there aren't even testing kits and equipment to test. It doesn't matter anyway. Everything is ok now.  Now it's time to get back out there, start spending your money, and get back to work! Let's open up the country back up. We're officially open for business. 🇺🇸|2020-04-30 06:14:54

p1uses|gaszeo|gaszeo|20|Good note from Bloomberg:  >**Bears will require material new negatives for them to not concede, if U.S. equities don’t come off their highs very soon.**  * This week has laid out all the most important markets facts: * The global economic impact has been devastating * Moral hazard isn’t a relevant concern for policy makers, and their willingness to prop up financial markets should not be underestimated * Earnings season is making clear that, for most companies, guidance is worse than useless; there’s no clarity on quite how bad it will be for many firms * No matter how optimistic you are on the virus, U.S. stocks are expensive  >But valuations don’t matter for retail investors -- they have bought the narrative that central banks will do whatever it takes until the virus quashed.   >   >Crucially, however, hedge fund equity-shorts remain near a multi-year extreme because they do care about valuations. I’m in that bearish camp. The problem for us is that the time has come for that bearish view to be proven correct -- we are now seeing the terrible economic data and companies with gloomy projections. If we don’t trade lower than here by the end of this week, **those shorts will begin throwing in the towel as they’ll have to acknowledge they are trading off the wrong drivers (economics and earnings).**|2020-04-30 07:06:37

Instead some traders bought these junk bonds in the hope of Fed would buy from them. ;)  >Jay Powell seems to have ignited a new round of optimism among junk-bond buyers. The biggest U.S. high-yield bond ETF $HYG saw another half billion dollars flow into it yesterday, with flows also going to $JNK & even $EMB, which owns emerging-markets debt.   >   >Fed Chair Powell did the opposite yesterday of pushing back against speculation that the central bank could buy more (and junkier) credit, or even buy stocks. Instead, he just said they could expand efforts & they're not out of ammo. Traders seem to be taking this as risk on.   >   >It's helpful to remember that the Fed has yet to buy a single junk bond.

Going with the gap for only 15 minutes and then turning around in the middle of nowhere price-wise is weird. And annoying since I tried to jump on the downtrend and got screwed.|2020-04-30 09:33:36

p1nk12|gaszeo|gaszeo|4|>Jay Powell seems to have ignited a new round of optimism among junk-bond buyers. The biggest U.S. high-yield bond ETF $HYG saw another half billion dollars flow into it yesterday, with flows also going to $JNK & even $EMB, which owns emerging-markets debt.   >   >Fed Chair Powell did the opposite yesterday of pushing back against speculation that the central bank could buy more (and junkier) credit, or even buy stocks. Instead, he just said they could expand efforts & they're not out of ammo. Traders seem to be taking this as risk on.   >   >It's helpful to remember that the Fed has yet to buy a single junk bond. This is all communication. The central bank has managed to put a floor under borrowing costs for many companies without putting a dollar to work. If it can continue to do this, it won't need to buy anything.  Whoever is buying junk bond is gonna face an ugly truth when this all ends, LMAO.|2020-04-30 05:15:28

The maker of the Model 3 sells credits to manufacturers who need them to comply with environmental standards that are getting stricter in most markets around the world.

p1wsif|gaszeo|gaszeo|7|Ok. Here is a theory. Whenever there is bad news the FED or its proxy Blackrock steps in to buy to prevent stocks from dropping. This causes upward movement. But whenever there is good news they do nothing. However because the underlying market movement is actually negative this causes downward movement.  TL:DR - Everyone is selling except the FED. FED only buys shit so stocks go up on bad news and down on good news.|2020-04-30 07:32:37

Securities owned outright by the Fed now make up 83% of its $6.6 T balance sheet.

p29wpz|gaszeo|gaszeo|2|Srs question  boys.   I want to do a straddle on SPY with an OTM put and OTM call cause I'm expecting a big move in either direction (I'm short term bearish actually). I want to do a short expiration like 5/1 but Since I have no day trades left, I'm worried that buying a short expiration Put/Call will lose value and It may be worth just going to a further date. I don't think it'll matter, but the THETA and IV crush are a big concern for me. I don't normally go this short on expiration so I'm not familiar on the contract prices here. So should I wait till EOD? Or just buy now cause it wont matter too much?  **TLDR:** Is it too early to buy a SPY 5/1 contract at mid day if I plan on selling it tomorrow? Or should I wait till end of day today? I don't think it'll matter, but the THETA and IV crush are a big concern for me.|2020-04-30 09:46:35

p2st4i|gaszeo|gaszeo|2|It's going to take Moderna like another year to make a vaccine. In the course of three or so months NYC is already showing 15% or so infection rate. Since everything is slowly reopening again, there is a very good chance that by the time any vaccines are even available that we'll have herd immunity right? So then even if Moderna can create a vaccine, would it even matter? Or is their value in the novelty of utilizing mRNA to develop a vaccine candidate? If successful they would have created a vaccine faster than most, but again the company might be worth a lot less if most people contract COVID by the time a vaccine is created|2020-04-30 12:21:39

AAPL is 11% of QQQ as the second largest holding, then AMZN is third largest at 10.14%.  Position:  $TQQQ 5/8 65p @ EOD today|2020-04-30 13:09:33

p2zwa3|gaszeo|gaszeo|2|LORL was suspended this morning, and then jumped 30%.  They co-own Telesat, and are in advanced talks to merge into one public company.  They announced a plan of $5.50 dividend per share, payable May 28th, for those holding their stock before end of market day May 14th.  They were on my radar because I have been switching gears to value investing, and they were definitely undervalued. Might be worth a look for others for the dividend.

p370uz|gaszeo|gaszeo|2|My thoughts:  AMZN and AAPL are probably the biggest earnings this week. Also, along with MSFT and TSLA, they’ve been leading the rally up. I expect they report good earnings,  good enough for the market to rally tomorrow and for spy to hit around 295. However, this past week of earnings, likely, will be the best week, since it’s been entirely tech driven. AMZN and AAPL will drive the market to reach its current peak, and I expect us to begin to see a slight sell off in May.   But then again, you have to inverse your own thoughts so spy 380c 5/20|2020-04-30 14:16:39

p1z5nq|gaszeo|gaszeo|1|Has anyone estimated the true unemployment, if you add back in all the jobs “saved” by PPP loans?  There are a lot of companies that retained workers because they got the loan, but those workers aren’t doing anything.  When wave #2 hits I think these workers get fired and join the unemployed.  Companies only have to keep them on payroll through end of June to get the loan forgiven.  What’s to stop PPP companies from just letting all these workers go July 1?|2020-04-30 08:00:15

p28k0i|gaszeo|gaszeo|1|Just realized every stock/option has a 2 cent commission/sales cost/fee/gov. regulatory cost.   So if you make 10,000 trades in a year that’s 200$. Ignoring the bid ask spread (you’d lose a lot more obviously).   Which is why as soon as the tx is done you are done by .02 and RH gives you a weird ass balance. Then you lost $ bc of the spread, even if you snake it your down a $1-$3 on that trade.  God it sucks being Jewish and poor. What did I do wrong 😩|2020-04-30 09:34:24

p1ubns|gaszeo|gaszeo|0|This earnings season was the most obvious long scenario and I feel like a retard for missing it until now.   Every single company has been affected by Coronavirus to a certain degree. But the public does not have the insight into how. And for some reason, they think Q1 is going to reflect the impact.   Earnings reports that actually have problems are given the headline or how Coronavirus has impacted them. It’s a scapegoat. When it can’t have had that much impact (with obvious exceptions).   And after the initial panic, the sentiment among investors regarding the virus now is “Im over it let’s open back up.”   This means that companies who had a bad quarter can blame it on something that most people are looking past, and companies who had a good quarter can say “coronavirus isn’t going to hurt us.” Even if that is a lazy projection that does not account for long term macro effects (Google did at least recognize this a few days before their call but that didn’t stop them from getting a massive boost at ER).   Either way, it’s a recipe for green everywhere on earnings and I missed it.   May go long on some Thursday PM reporters.|2020-04-30 07:00:17
