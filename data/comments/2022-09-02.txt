At the end of the rainbow is just a bunch of people with lots of money that package and resell debt to people with a little less money and it just keeps going in a cycle from there.   Until people stand up and do something about it, it will only continue to get worse. Kind of sad that we went from a country where very few people carried debt to a country where over 80% carry a balance in one way or another.  They’ve found a way to “farm” your life by having you work ~30 years so you can pay off the place you rest between work days, the thing you use to get to work from the place you rest, the land that your resting place sits on, and many other things. Just so that you can finally start saving heavily for retirement for the last 10ish years after they’ve siphoned all they could from your prime/most productive years. And we are okay with that.

The circumstances of Maganov’s death were confirmed by Reuters, citing two anonymous sources. The oil firm, and its chairman, had been critical of the Ukraine war, expressing disapproval in a statement on March 3.  https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/lukoil-chairman-ravil-maganov-is-the-8th-russian-energy-executive-to-die-suddenly-this-year.html  At least Xi was kind enough to simply disappear Jack Ma for a couple months instead of straight up Kashogiing him.|2022-09-02 08:22:25

msbd7u|x3xj5h|x3xj5h|7|You write your daughter's name in pen on the brown paper bag, pause, then add a smiley face. You put a PB&J in the bag, a granola bar, and a peach. You grew those peaches. When you and your wife first bought this house years ago, you checked out books about growing fruit trees at the library, then you did it. Your family, and some neighbors, now look forward to relaxing in "the orchard"--the extravagant name everyone jokingly calls the firepit next to your *five whole* fruit trees.  "You coming to my game tonight, Dad?" *That depends on how my calls do* your tired face says, but you reply with a chipper tone, "Of course, kiddo." She didn't see your face while she hunted for breakfast cereal, and so she believes you. Just like your wife believes you're happy. Just like those neighbors who sometimes sit in the orchard do. No one knows how bored you were--you are--and how discovering options made you feel alive again. Feel anything again.  Perhaps feel a bit too much. Especially for someone out of practice. For someone that hadn't tasted dopamine in so long. It seemed harmless at first. You thought you knew what you were doing. You wanted to feel smart. You wanted to be good at something. And you were. You were good at being exit liquidity.  You watch your daughter peer into her lunch bag and furrow her brow. "Dad, do I have to take a peach again?"|2022-09-02 07:05:11

msh29m|x3xj5h|x3xj5h|6|Wow, what a shocker.  The Pelosis sold ALL of their positions in NVDA in July. Right before the news breaks out a few weeks later that the US was going to start restricting sales of NVDA products to China that tanked the stock. This is yet another suspicious Pelosi trade, just like the time they bought like a million dollars in Amazon calls right before it was announced that the Pentagon was dropping contracts for Microsoft cloud services.

Similar to 432 , 421 where SPY could not push above upper trendline, SPY did dead cat bounce from lower trend line support at 390. 3. Many longs at 410-400 still trapped. Many more short at 390 trapped. 4. Shorts at 421 will profit take. New longs FOMO this dead cat bounce. 5. Jpow comment more or less reflect .75 bps.

Its stock hit a 52-week low of $71.60 in July, and one Wall Street firm thinks it could soar to $200 over the next 12 to 18 months. The stock has already rebounded to about $80 per share, but that still leaves plenty of upside potential for investors who buy.|2022-09-02 13:02:45

mu0quv|x3xj5h|x3xj5h|-10|How I’m probably going to lose my relationship and everything i love.  Hey Guys,  I do not know if ever someone is going to read this, but i had to write it down.  I don’t want to use my real name, but let’s call me Bart. I am 31 years old, have a gilfriend for about 10 years now, and an 1,5 years old son.  I started in crypto back in januari 2019… Yes, for the people who now right after the first bullrun of 2018, not a bad timing (at all). I lost $3000,- within 1 month. But ok, it was money i was afford to lose, and decided to try it again. But this time, i did it different, i decided to study the markets and learned day in day out.  After almost 2 year full time studying, i felt like it was the time to add some more money, and to take more risks. After the Covid-19 crash i decided to add another 2,5 k and that’s the point i started to day-trade. I was succesfull… almost the whole year i was picking the right coins and profitable… Time of my life, and i was very happy i never quited in crypto. Good choice, well done. At my peek my PF reached an ATH of 56k+  But then.. Lot of things happend, the coin i went deep in got hacked, and i lost something like 35k… BTC reached his top, and after that it was all just catching knives. I never thought Bitcoin would retrace like it did. I added some more, to be honest i went all in with leverage..   That’s where all the shit started, as you can guess i lost all my money. I got liquidated. A couple times, i got stressed and i want to make it back. I decided to put my 1k of my savings in. Just to buy the dip, and then i would start over again… I did it before, so with a littlebit dicipline i would do it again.  Offcourse i should have know better.. Discipline? What discipline, i saw some opportunities so i decided to open a long again. It went good. I traded back like 3k or something like that.  Just like before offcourse i did not take any profits. Few weeks later i got liquidated again. War in Rusia/Ukraine and the whole market crashed again. Damn 1k of my savings.  I decided to quit for a while, take some rest and overthink. Cried a couple times and decided to pick up when the time was right.  Few weeks later i opened my laptop and i saw the prices dumped like hell. FUCK these prices. I must buy that fucking dip, wait a few months and hold.. Thats all, i will be ok. So i put my (and my girlfriend) last 5k savings in crypto.  It worked! I’m healthy now, i learned my lessons i’m ok. I thought… After a month of 480% profit with OP, IMX, WOO & KDA. I thought hey, i got my discipline now. Lets start a small trade, just with Leverage 2x.  It went well, i was profitable, a couple times after eachother. Fuck it, lets take some risks. Let’s try leverage x10 all the big players do it, so why shouldn’t I…..   That’s where i official fucked up my life. I don’t even want to tell the whole story. I just want to tell i got liquidated again. My pf balance on zero(0) and my bank account on zero(0). No money anymore empty.  My girlfriend doesnt know it yet. Every moment i see her and my son i want to cry, i dont know what do to anymore. I know she is going to leave me, and i understand her. I fucking lost the savings, i cant even book a vacation anymore. And everytime i keep thinking that the only solution is to ‘win’ it back. But thats where i got deeper and deeper… i’m done, empty, tired, depressed. And about to lose everything i love, in a matter of time……  I’ve got a problem, i think i got addicted to crypto just like a gamble addict. I dont want it anymore, i just want my normal life back, with my girlfriend and my son. Want to enjoy things with family and friends.   Not looking at charts anymore, no late night, sleepless nights and unhealthy life anymore.  I FUCKED UP and i dont know what do anymore.  If you read this, please stay away from crypto. (I thought this would never happen to me, im a normal guy, with a normal job and normal friends and family, but it happend to me, i got addicted)  Please think about it, you dont want this feeling.  Thanks for reading guys. PLEASE cryptostarters, take this serious please.  Bye Bart|2022-09-02 14:06:43

msisdb|x3xj5h|x3xj5h|-1|Could use some highly regarded wisdom from my 2nd favorite bunch of regards. I sold about 1/3 of my original BBBY position at $27 after a $9 cost basis. I bought back another 1/3 of what I sold on the way down (LOL) and now my cost basis is around $10.69. I havent done the full calculation, but I basically already covered my cost basis with my first sell and Im now riding the train for free, granted I have a small loss at this point giving the current price. I'm anticipating a (small) pop in the near future and plan on selling the majority of what I have left when that happens. Is this a good way of approaching BBBY in the short term or am I regarded?|2022-09-02 08:06:19

Average Daily Short sale volume has been over 50% the past several weeks. Will soon be right up there with $MELI regarding Top EM companies. Its a True disruptor in Latin American Fintech/ Banking.  $IHS is a Top Emerging Market Tower Play (4G/5G/ etc ... similar to AMT Towers).  All 7 Analyst have a Buy rating... Price is Currently around $6.50, due to very low volume manipulation (150,000). Average PT is $18 (most recent PT is $27).
