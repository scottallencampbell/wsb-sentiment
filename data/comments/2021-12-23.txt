ppm9d8|rmt9nk|rmt9nk|7|MU's move today is pretty much just a reminder that the best plays are often post-earnings or post-news "secondary" moves on currently popular thematic plays.  I've gotten 10-baggers on RBLX, MU, and a fair number of other post-earning plays the past year.  Nothing is ever safe, and you're basically playing 0DTEs to get those gains, but there's often times where stocks get pinned at levels with high volumes, and then explode when the pin is overrun.  RBLX got pinned the days after its earnings around $100 and then overran that on a Friday, 0DTEs printed.  MU's pin the past 2 days around $90 got overran today, and 0DTEs printed.  AAPL moving out of that coil around $150 is a good example of that as well last month.|2021-12-23 12:26:40

Reading fake and gay futures? 2. Accountants are constantly trying to upsell services like "addiction counseling" and "smart money management" courses.  As if it isn't enough that you are already paying them to help the government take your money. 3. You aren't going to be audited anyway and if you are it is easy to argue that you messed up on taxes because you were too retarded to understand them.  Tl;Dr fuk taxes|2021-12-23 07:20:44

Shall we provide hearty school lunches to all the schoolchildren in Texas (or wherever you are living) and tell them: this lunch comes from Elon Musk? Shall we give a salary increase to all the CIA officers who risk their lives in anonymity for our country (didn't you name your child after a CIA reconnaissance aircraft)? Build libraries? Establish electric vehicle maintenance apprenticeships? Build charging stations? Shall we build homes for homeless Americans and tell them: this home comes from Elon Musk? Ask, and we shall consider it. When is the SpaceX IPO? I want a piece of that.  Santa market? More like Jesus-the-Savior market, am I right? Thank you Jesus for these SPY calls. I'm done buying puts.

ppzrsk|rmt9nk|rmt9nk|14|The best way to deal with FOMO is to remember there's always going to be future plays to make in the market.  Today MU 0DTEs were 10-15 baggers if you played them right.  Past 2 days TSLA has done that.  Over the past 3 days, SPY has been a 10-bagger on 3DTEs.  That's 3 plays this week and there were countless other plays that would have worked.  You just have to be patient and wait for the next ones to come into view.  There will always be other plays.  If you absolutely have the itch to FOMO and can't shake it, make a small directional bet that's slightly OTM with money you don't mind putting at a high level of risk.  Trying to chase (unless it's SPY and you're chasing the entire market) is almost always a bad idea.  You probably already missed the timing of whatever you're FOMOing.|2021-12-23 14:02:37

po5kuc|rmt9nk|rmt9nk|7|Respected Wall Street strategist, “my butthole,” woke up 2 hours ahead of its morning alarm just to diarrhea its brains out. Generally, a read like this from one of wall street’s analytical titans is a bearish indicator, but like all things in the pandemic era- this indicator may not carry over to market sentiment. In fact, just last week, ULNT’s butthole gave a bearish watery poo signal that was brushed off by bullish traders to initiate the current rally. We await the cash open to see if this once prescient butthole will have its day in the spotlight once more.   -Financial Times|2021-12-23 05:08:16

They do a significantly better job at pulling profit out of the market of "people need to get from point A to point B." You can't compare to legacy automakers, who use an old technology that's more expensive than where EV technology is heading, and use dealerships and burn money for ads.  You have to take a huge step back and look at what they make on actual products, the gross margins and eventually operational margins to understand what earnings they'll achieve. On top of that, they're going to be a huge player on solar too. The P/E should be trading where no company ever has.

IT IS PATHETIC HOW MANY ARE BEGGING FOR RELIEF.  My parents have 8 kids and not one of us were given a dime for college, and neither of them attended college being 2nd generation immigrants. [to those saying my loans were paid off my my parents]  I studied a field in STEM and realized in high school the sacrifice I needed to make in order to pay off my debt. [shame on me for understanding the net present value of a decision and choosing a field that I had to work MY A** off in order to succeed in]  My hard work has landed me where I am today, I am self made and an example of capitalism where hard work will get you what you desire. [I studied STEM and worked full time after my 4 year bachelors. I immediately went to graduate school to place my loans into deferment. By doing so I was able to pay them off while working full time in two years as I finished my masters.]  Can anyone also explain to me why when I suggest I get a tax credit for all of the debt I paid off for my education, that it’s unfair to those that would get debt forgiven?

pp9euh|rmt9nk|rmt9nk|-6|Hi all, Here are the best bullish charts I’ve found this month. I have a position in all full disclosure after buying my last positions yesterday and today. Good luck hope this peaks your interest! Merry Christmas  TFX - Teleflex: Medical device company focused on urinary issues as well as fluid draining of lungs. They’re products are always in high demand for catheters etc. but Covid has really boosted lung product sales.  CTT - Catchmark Timber Trust: Owns and harvests on high quality timberlands that have been producing at high levels recently due to timber boom and housing boom.  ENR - Energizer Holdings: batteries. I like the chart and we’re heading into Christmas which is like battery pallooza for the industry.  FSS - Federal Signal Corporation: makes radios, sirens, speciality electronics for huge gvt police, fire military etc contracts. Great chart  MSGS - Madison Square Garden: great dip this month due to fears of closing nba and nhl seasons due to Covid. Msgs owns the knicks and the rangers and the garden itself. Rangers just set a record nhl valuation at $2 billion. That’s huge for an nhl team. Should move msgs significantly higher.  MBT - Mobile Telesystems: literally just riding the ups and waiting for super predictable dips on this one for the last 7 months. easy money honestly  NYT - New York Times: self explanatory. Great bullish set up right now.  STE - Steris: medical equipment company specializing in sterilization products for hospitals which has been awesome throughout Covid. Great chart and nice hedge for an unforeseen omicron wave.|2021-12-23 10:57:57

popuvn|rmt9nk|rmt9nk|1|Everyday this week at the open NVAX has been heavily shorted. This reminds me of the GME tricks hedgies were pulling. The shorts would have to buy back around 1.4bn worth of stock to exit the official short position although obviously it would probably cost them a lot, lot more as the price would run up.  There is fuckery afoot. If suddenly someone starts buying I'm sure this has squeeze potential even though the official figure is 10.3% short. They have such a big order book now and with the approvals and it looking like the best Covid shot there is no way  Moderna should be 7.5 times the market cap it doesn't make sense. They could potentially do their market cap in revenue next year and they have other products coming too.  I suspect the unofficial short position is significantly higher than 10.3%.|2021-12-23 08:35:19
