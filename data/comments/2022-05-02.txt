70wiop|ugm6ft|ugm6ft|6|okay.  Not sure exactly what is going to happen today.  But for those of you that like to inverse a stupid stupid man...  AMD, strangle.  90C, 84P - Try and get out before earnings release unless it's looking like a good Green Day for everything.  SPY - Strangle 420C, 410P - Try and be out by 10:00 or 10:30  TSLA 900P/1000C is usually a money maker.  But this week feels weird.  Ford feels undervalued, but I haven't done my research there so I'm just watching it.  Still have to do my research on long Puts for Real Estate.  edit:  Oh yea, and Activision Calls 80c, then 70p.  I think people might FOMO in with Buffett and MSFT, but I don't trust it.  Of these I could only afford a SPY Put for Wednesday.  Also strangled AMC at 15P/16C cause cheap. Made a profit off the SPY Put on the last dip, and the AMC put.  waiting to see if I actually make it out of the 16c for AMC in one piece.|2022-05-02 08:21:20

71duxm|ugm6ft|ugm6ft|9|Still doesn't feel like stocks are anywhere near as bearish as bonds are.  One of the two markets is going to be proven wrong.  Either equities are still overpriced, or bonds are too cheap.  10 year yield at 3% is basically way above the natural rate that the US economy can sustain.  US government debt is too large relative to the economy and long-term growth levels for that to be a sustainable situation.  S&P 500 is down 14-15% off ATHs, but still up 40-45% from pre-pandemic levels.  Stocks are cheaper than they were the last 2 years, but still nowhere near P/E levels pre-pandemic.|2022-05-02 10:29:38

Tell Jerome Powell I say he's fucking fired, and I'm going to end the Fed. This is the dumbest decision by the grossly incompetent baby boomer generation since they decided the war crime of torture was the best way to "win the hearts and minds" of Iraqis and Afghanis. Quintupled the amount of dollars in circulation! Thanks, Generation Fuck-Up.

70uuvo|ugm6ft|ugm6ft|7|Dollar is approaching strongest levels since the tech bust (around 2002) based on DXY.  Nearing parity with the Euro (Europe falling into recession would probably push it to 1:1 parity).  You look at all the various indicators (bond prices/yields, stocks, dollar vs other currencies), and the only possible conclusion is that this is turning into a combination of the 70s inflation spike merged with the 2000 tech bust.  It's literally the worst possible combination: an across the board asset bust at a time when inflation is spiking and there's nowhere else to put money except to stay in cash and take the inflation hit until assets get cheap enough to buy the dip.|2022-05-02 08:07:31

She puts a hand softly on your back and asks again, more calmly this time, "What's wrong?" You look up from your distorted, chrome reflection in the bottom of the sink and smile at her. "Nothing. I think it's just my medicine. I'll be fine." She stares at your face for a moment longer, then nods, satisfied with your answer. She returns to the bedroom to get ready for work.  You return to your reflection, and you don't recognize yourself. You didn't exactly lie to her. It's just that the medicine you meant was the bottom shelf vodka you drank last night, not the new anti-depressant she knows you are supposed to be taking. You hate the way vodka makes you feel the next morning, but you've learned through trial and error that people are less likely to smell it on you than they would bourbon.  You reach for your phone and see pre-market is still mostly flat or red. All those calls. All those far out-of-the-money calls. Expiring today. You dry heave again and yell, "I'm fine!" to prevent her from coming to check on you again. After all, you don't want her to see you pouring another drink.|2022-05-02 08:09:25

72bcsk|ugm6ft|ugm6ft|2|For those of you that only joined in the last two years, there was a lot of sentiment back in 2019 that the Fed and its Trump Pump were juicing the markets. The reversal of rate increases and QT that sent the market down 20% in 2018 was a sign that the US Gov was propping it up as high as it was. A lot of people thought the S&P500 jumping 10% and breaking 3,000 was crazy and indicative of overheating.  This time around the Fed can't backtrack thanks to CPI getting out of control. Point being, rate increases and QT could very well send us down another 10-20% back to 2019 levels.|2022-05-02 14:13:19

The consumer is actually incredibly weak right now, incomes haven‚Äôt increased nearly enough to compete with inflation and thus they‚Äôre getting squeezed. They will not be able to afford luxuries, and soon they will not be able to afford food.   Am I over-panicking here?|2022-05-02 08:52:54

71fmcq|ugm6ft|ugm6ft|1|So I am holding an AMR put over the last three weeks and I am happily ITM. I am fairly new to options and today I was eyeing the ticker with more attention. And today is the first time I have witnessed the sometimes outweighed impact IV has on value. Today the stock has gone pretty steadily down. But the up and down fluctuations of put price have had a lot more to do with IV, which has bounced between zero and 30%.        I am wondering what are the most common causes of these hour to hour swings in IV? Earnings are in a few days but I would think that the IV increase as earnings approaches would go up in a more steady pattern. This blowback between low and medium levels seems to be caused by other forces, right?        Could it be macroeconomic coniditons? In general it seems the market is pretty volatile today, with SPY bumping up and down a percentage and VIX going up +10%.        For more commonly traded options stocks, say Tesla, Ford, Twitter or a Dividend ETF, depending on strategy, what sort of hourly IV swings should I expect? Esp presuming there is not a super influential event like earnings, tweet, or scandal, etc.        Thanks for your advice.|2022-05-02 10:41:45

Hasnt really popped off news of that Saudi deal too. Last earnings was bad news everybody knew (chip shortages and issues with the evonomy that is affecting everyone)   With a stock beaten down so low and the market having a correction means buy low to me.
