They will aim to drop the price at market open to paper hand you. If they do it during pre market it gives you time to regather your thoughts and you wont make emotional decisions at open. However you will make emotional decisions if they decide to drop it when you can actually sell.

lpw083|lat43j|lat43j|243|News is spreading so many lies. Let's break it down:  If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?  This only has one answer: they haven't covered.  If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.  If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: **there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.**|2021-02-02 05:26:47

Either shut down trading altogether or don't. They shut down one side while HF were allowed to piledrive the price into oblivion, and who knows how much they shorted on the way down. That effectively killed all buy-side momentum and let them reposition their shorts at a much higher level effectively making fucking bank on the way down.

lqmb3o|lat43j|lat43j|34|PER MARK CUBAN  Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular   So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.|2021-02-02 09:19:25

Like some high school peer pressure bullying bullshit, only instead of your lunch money they're going after your investments (which for a lot of us isn't a whole lot more proportionally, myself included).   In my experience, bullys cover their fear with threats. Thats what this all is right now. EMPTY THREATS. They are desperate and scared cause now the whole playground is on to them and they about to get their asses WHOOPED!  They're acting like we never took a hit before, like we're scared of a little scuffle cause they don't live in the streets we grew up on. They're SCARED of being broke and eating ramen daily to make ends meet. MOTHER FUCKERS DONT KNOW WE ALREADY THERE LIVING IT!   They saw fearlessness last week and are trying to break us of that. What they don't get is that we aren't fearless, WE ARE JUST RETARDED AND STOCKS GO BRRRRR!!   Its courage they see, my fellow autists, and these scared lil bitches don't get it.   We don't see each other behind our screens and monitors but I see the numbers and they don't lie. We are together, I am here with you all and you with me. The WORLD is with us.  Even my wife's boyfriend Brad is with us and he only eats the yellow crayons (which as we all know is the worst flavor).  We've got some real diamond hands here boys, apes that have literally seen MILLIONS in loss and they are STILL HERE! So grab your fucking balls, quit your bitching, and stock up on these juicy dips cause the HF assholes thought a DISCOUNT SALE was gonna have you running away!

lqr6z4|lat43j|lat43j|24|"Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.   That then accelerates the selling.   Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular  &#x200B;  So what to do ?   If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.   Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.   I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street." - Mark Cuban  Don't think enuf ppl saw this so I'm just gonna leave this here.

lqph0j|lat43j|lat43j|25|LISTEN TO CUBAN  Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular  So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.|2021-02-02 09:38:41

Buffets quote: "Markets are here to serve you not instruct you" turn off your devices and stay calm and collected. This is far from over. Its basic math and supply and demand. They are using massively low volume as a trick to get you to sell. Look up the VW squeeze. Literally the same scenario playing out. They are using a bear trap to shake us out. So they can make it look like price is falling and they will cover at lower and lower prices to paper hands.

I feel like this interconnectivity between these stocks is strange to say the least. On the other hand, it gives me hope all will go back up sooner or later.|2021-02-02 09:32:59
lqokmq|lat43j|lat43j|23|Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.   That then accelerates the selling.   Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular  ​  So what to do ?   If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.   Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.   I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.

lqp3o9|lat43j|lat43j|25|Buy in on AMC while it’s at $6. Dirt cheap. Movies are reopening soon (see Twitter) BUY AMC. STOCK WILL GO UP.

lqb1h8|lat43j|lat43j|22|learned this investment tip from my gay aunt. When you buy Gamestop, dont just stare at your phone all day. evertime i buy a stock, I gently squeeze my phone between my glute cheeks and set my phone to vibrate every time the shares moves. the tingling keeps me grounded and focused on the present moment. I find my mind wandering on painful past memories or future anxiety, but my new meditation mantra gently reminds me to focus on the present moment and remain mindful of all the boof stocks I'm buying. namestay is the way. Also, and this is super serious, if you've never had a prostate orgasm, this method is great at relieving stress and relieving the backlog of prostate milk youve built while holding Gamestop. Your investment is more than a financial revolution, it's spiritual orgasmic sexual revolution. Sure these hedge funds want your money, but they want even more than that. They want to repress your prostate milk. I'm talking pure spiritual energy that's inside all of you. Milk your prostate and release your tendies.  Ladies can also tap into this raw spiritual orgasmic jet fuel by placing the phone on the front of your clitoral hood. My wife's gay boyfriend showed me where this is. many women apparently lack sensitivity in this nether region from Hitachi wand over use. This method can bring back that sensitivity and more. Gamestop isn't just going to the moon. Its going to the milky way.|2021-02-02 08:04:52

lqcri3|lat43j|lat43j|21|With all these new retail investors I think we need to start paying attention to volume spikes Fridays and Mondays.  That will be payday and retail investors will have fresh capital.  This week was also the first of the month. Everyone was paying their rent. I would have had 2 grand more to throw at this if it weren’t for rent and other bills.  Also, for a lot of first timers, this is their first time seeing red.  It’s scary when you’re gambling with life changing amounts of money.  Assuming many people jumped in from $200-$400 and probably only got a handful of shares, losing even 30% of that for your average American is a lot to lose.  Seeing money literally evaporate into nothing for the first time is a slap in the face and is a new feeling for so many people.  For noobs, when its all green it feels like it can never go down. When it’s red, it feels like it is doomsday and it will never come up and you’ve lost everything.  It is so hard to play this game with no emotion when you are new to it.  Trust the reason you first invested. Trust the math. Trust your fellow autists.  The DD is all there for you to find.  Know that investing is a patient man’s game. You are not a day trader so set up price alerts so you aren’t constantly checking your phone and go distract yourself with something else.|2021-02-02 08:18:19

Buffets quote: "Markets are here to serve you not instruct you" turn off your devices and stay calm and collected. This is far from over. Its basic math and supply and demand. They are using massively low volume as a trick to get you to sell. Look up the VW squeeze. Literally the same scenario playing out. They are using a bear trap to shake us out. So they can make it look like price is falling and they will cover at lower and lower prices to paper hands.

lq2wj0|lat43j|lat43j|41|To everyone that is scared, you need to understand something that is very important in order to sleep peacefully at night.  Imagine a hostage situation at a bank. 200 bank robbers are holding 3 people hostage inside the bank in a room where oxygen supplies are running low. The only way for the 3 people to get out is if they give away the code to a large safe in the bank, losing the bank all of their money.  Simple scenario right? Now I ask you this: Who feels more afraid, and who has power in this situation? That too, even for you smooth brained retards should be simple: Robbers have the power and the bankers are afraid.  This is what the situation is today. We are the robbers, and they are the hostages. WE ARE HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE. They have no way out AS LONG AS WE HOLD. If the 200 robbers just leave the bank they walk away unscathed.  If they stay, they will have to give up the code sooner or later, because it is better than dying from asphyxiation.  That is what is happening, and therefore you need to know that as long as we all hold, we are good.|2021-02-02 06:50:50
lq3mqv|lat43j|lat43j|46|   HOLD $GME $AMC. There is no volume selling off. Don't be fooled by their scare tactics. There are no real selling, just wall street trading among themselves to look like there is selling off.  WE WILL NOT BE FOOLED. WE WILL NOT BE SCARED|2021-02-02 06:58:21

lpwdhq|lat43j|lat43j|16|To each human assign a statistic called 'patience'. It is raised when you discover someone with less, doing something you yourself would not do because the timing is  precipitous.  It is raised once more when one matures enough for a degree of introspection. If I am looking ahead this far for my decisions and outcompeting others by doing so, are others doing so to me?  What are the inherent qualities of this patience? Well for me it's the fact I have free time and resources. Lots of the former, less of the latter. If I made this my profession I could increase the time spent on it and use other peoples resources.  These are the people on the other end of the GME trade and to use the appropriate parlance, they have this 'patience' statistic buffed to fuck.   In their shoes, reading our daily comments threads, I would be confident I could wait us out today. But that's because they think of us as a collective. They likely can wait longer than 6 million of us.  But I can also wait that long. The longer this carries on, the more time we have to catch them in a mistake. The longer this carries on the more press attention it gets and the sooner we are to an end to lockdowns. To Gamestop themselves making their move. To congressional hearings. To the possibility of squeezes of all varieties. And sure, while it's heavily shorted there's the possibility of the big one. There's also equal possibilities of lots of little ones and every shade of fuckery as well as or instead of too.  But you only find out if you have patience.|2021-02-02 05:31:47

lqp81w|lat43j|lat43j|39|FROM CUBAN      Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular  So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.|2021-02-02 09:37:13

lq4wtp|lat43j|lat43j|40|Many people are forgetting that AMC is the biggest theater chain in the world. They have a huge community of movie goers who are patiently waiting for COVID restrictions to ease. If you don't happen to make money in the short term squeeze with AMC (which is still likely), you can make money in the long term by holding your stocks, and waiting for AMC to get back to normal business. And to those who tell you the movie business is shifting toward streaming services, you can tell them that is like comparing apples and oranges. Watching a movie in your living room is no where near the same experience as watching a movie in theaters. That would be the equivalent of saying people are no longer going to go to amusement parks as VR becomes more and more advanced. Also production companies stand to make more money through movie theater ticket sales than one time purchases of a movie on whatever streaming service.  I am buying more AMC in this dip because I love going to the movies, and I am one of those who are patiently waiting for the theaters to come back into full swing.

Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

lqn62i|lat43j|lat43j|34|I'm guilty of being caught up in the hype as much as the next person.  I've seen the information from S3 and other analysts and the question they don't answer is....  Where did the shorts go?  The data could show that some of it was captured and repaid during the initial jumps but no way did it cover all the shorts.  Even S3 admits there's still a large percentage out there.    If anyone saw the VW short squeeze, the price actually dropped to the pre-squeeze levels before shooting up.  This may happen here, it may not but the pattern looks near identical to the VW graph.  How many times has the media lied?  About silver, about the loss of hype, about this group.  They also tried everything to redirect your investing to other stocks, or to scare you to sell.  Why are the apps still refusing to allow you to buy?  They may not be able to cover their costs and have liquidity issues but that means there are still tons of people buying.  These hedge funds are very very advanced at manipulating the market but they have been burned before and all their tech doesn't allow for shorts not to be repaid back.  Let's just say half the people in this Reddit just bought one share. The amount of shares owned is a large percentage of either company and if we are holding and the price is still going down, they are manipulating the price but they will have to pay up eventually.  Remember, previous shorts took days or weeks to fulfill.  Hold strong apes.|2021-02-02 09:24:46

lqq3eu|lat43j|lat43j|33|Mark Cuban: : "So what to do? If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I don't own it, but that's what I would do. Why? Because when RH and other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work. I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB. I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use. Do you stay with RH, who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street."|2021-02-02 09:42:17

lqetfs|lat43j|lat43j|16|🚀🚀🚀 GME - STATISTICS FROM SWEDEN 🚀🚀🚀  I just got the latest GME-statistics from the two biggest stock-trading-platforms in SWEDEN - Avanza and Nordnet (there are others as well as regular banks too, but those two are the biggest when it comes to volume).  Both of them saw a 19% increase of share holders yesterday (Monday).  Avanza has of right now 33 400 share holders and Nordnet 25 000.  Date; Amount Of Share holders  2 February	       33.400 1 February	       28.040 29 January	24.200 28 January	15.020 27 January	6.120 26 January	5.310 25 January	2.130 22 January	1.860 4 January	       600   Sweden has a population of just above 10 MM people. They have a tradition of investing in the stock market and therefore quite a high ratio of share holders in the population compared to many other countries.  Maybe some other autist can help with extrapolating this statistic to other comparable countries and maybe we can calculate the True ownership through out the world that way.

lqjhdk|lat43j|lat43j|16|   EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻  ”The volume is low”.  What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.  Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.  In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.  So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already.

Getting up on a slalom ski is hard, and every time before the boat revved up I had to focus all my effort on just hanging on to the handle with a steel tight grip.  Once, halfway to getting up, I fell over. This normally means that your attempt is done, it’s time for the boat to swing back around and pick you up. Except I had programmed it into my head not to let go until my ski was behind me, and to the surprise of everyone onboard still I slowly rose from the water. I rose to the top and was able to start slaloming.  Today, I need that same energy from all of you. 💎🙌 no matter what, to the moon.|2021-02-02 06:40:07

I’m a student still living with his parents who sold all of his boomer shares to gamble a bit.

lq1tzx|lat43j|lat43j|14|Just a general note, for the diamond hand memers and others:  You don’t have to trade every day. You can just watch price action and not buy your one daily share on a .05 dip. Or, you can not watch at all. Set some price alerts if you want or just check in every so often. Reading a million of the same comment “scared but holding” won’t help your wallet or your mental health. I’ve battled it myself and it’s like any other technology addiction once the initial itch goes away you can find some peace|2021-02-02 06:39:15

lqbakd|lat43j|lat43j|28|Only 1 week on WSB but over 20 years trading volatile stocks my perspective -- turn off the alarm, sleep in, and check back very occasionally, then repeat -- You'll know when the stock is going to pop because you will agonize about how much profit you need to take. That time has not arrived. In the mean time, stocks that decline after you buy them is the norm for volatile stocks as is the norm that when they skyrocket you look back at the low prices and wish you could have bought more. If you wanted 'safe' you'd buy the S and P 500 index but you want to travel so you're hear. This 'feels' like it could take a couple of weeks to really pop but what the fuck do I know.  Borrow your rent money, but do not borrow to invest and it's normal to buy more and more as a stock declines so long as the value and fundamentals (or massive short's that need to be made up) are really there.  Be glad you have all this idiotic company; it's MUCH harder doing this alone. MUCH.  *This is not financial advice, I am definitely super fucking retarded. I sold Netflix and bought the only company making Facebook a profit at FB's IPO. My stock lost 90% and Netflix is worth  4000% more today so yeah, hang on and chill with alertness and calmness and shit cause a positive attitude is your friend.*|2021-02-02 08:06:56

lqg5g0|lat43j|lat43j|30|Apes, Tards and Autist alike: our shares are being used against us. Put in sell orders of $69,420 for GME, AMC and BB. If your shares are just sitting in your account YOUR brokerage can lend those shares to the scummy fucking hedges we’re at war with. They’re using our own shares against us to spread fear and drive down the price. If your shares have a pending “sell” they can’t be loaned. If those shares are loaned and you put in a sell today those borrowed shares have to be closed by Friday. Let’s start flexing some pressure the other way. Spread the word apetards.

lpvvwg|lat43j|lat43j|70|**$AMC stands at 78.97% of shares floated - Out of the available 56.5M shares, Wall Street have shorted 44.6M of them.**  The bad news however, is that according to the records, the average number of shares swapping hands on a daily basis is 96.6M, meaning it would take them a day to cover their shorts, meaning they wouldn't be too worried about interest build up on their borrowed stocks.  **My take on it is this:**  Analysing that data suggests that each share is swapping hands almost twice a day, which seems odd if the majority of WSB and the others who've invested amid growing speculation of a "short squeeze" are holding, not selling, and buying the dips.  Now it could be possible that a lot of WSB are panic selling, but posting true "diamond hand" comments to feel like they're still part of the game, despite pulling out. However, I find this unlikely.  The other possibility, is that Wall Street are manipulating the average daily volume of trades, in order to make it appear that enough stock is available for them to cover there shorts, and buy doing this, lowering the price of the stock.  With this in mind, through holding and buying the dips, reducing the shares they have access to thus meaning eventually there will not be enough shares available to cover there short positions.  So to summarise, its pivotal that you hold your stocks, if you like them, and buy the dips.  The short volume increased over the last day or so by roughly 5M shares (as reported, could be false), but this suggests we could be in a better position, should we hold and buy.  Stocks go up and stocks go down, that's the game.  ...but patience is key. Educate yourselves, and make informed decisions.  Don't risk what you can't afford to lose.  The $AMC rocket is still awaiting launch, don't let the dips worry you.  (The same is essentially true for $GME, but I've not taken a look into that stonk in detail yet.)  🚀  🚀  🚀  &#x200B;  (Not a financial advisor, shhh.)  \*EDIT: REMOVE THOSE SELL LIMITS.  \*EDIT2: YESTERDAY SAW A HUGE RISE PRE-MARKET BEFORE DIPPING BACK TO OPEN PRICE.

I like the stocks.  PS. The current price is $136, I can see it getting close to 100 but not far under 100 so be ready with your buy orders if you have them.  **Edit:** Look: [https://youtu.be/nhiHorRZE\_E](https://youtu.be/nhiHorRZE_E) watch the GME trades, the volumes are like 1 share 2 shares 100 shares, 600 max....

lqoiwh|lat43j|lat43j|42|From Mark Cuban himself in his ama thread. All of you need to read this:  Edit: tldr - fucking hold and buy the dip. And get away from Robinhood   Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular   So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.|2021-02-02 09:33:06

lqgrh1|lat43j|lat43j|13|Trading Update for GME and AMC  Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  While we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause, this is not a decision Revolut has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the stocks they make available. We will however keep you informed as and when this situation changes.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME nor AMC will appear in search. Please check the email we are sending out to all Revolut Trading Ltd customers for additional information about this situation.  Capital at risk.

HOW FUCKING STUPID ARE YOU.  this is exactly what they want. you’re all certain it’s going back to 20$ if your monkey brain with 5 days experience in stocks thinks that big money knows that. it’s obviously being shorted on the way down. This is the idea of a infinity squeeze every time the previous shorts cover new scum will try short it on the way down. after the squeeze if we all hold the line and don’t allow it to slide those shorts will have to cover and so on until they realise it isn’t a good idea to short business that supports tens of thousands of jobs around the world during a pandemic. I don’t think most Americans understand the reach of GameStop (living in Ireland almost every little town has a GameStop). Just because you paper-handed doesn’t make you smart it makes you a idiot for bringing it down and losing out on massive gains for everyone. but it’s not over we may want two lifetimes supply of trendies but shorts are greedy greedy greedy people this is being shorted into the ground.

lq72lk|lat43j|lat43j|28|I hate having to remind everyone that these are not real prices. Buffets quote: "Markets are here to serve you not instruct you" turn off your devices and stay calm and collected. This is far from over. Its basic math and supply and demand. They are using massively low volume as a trick to get you to sell. Look up the VW squeeze. Literally the same scenario playing out. They are using a bear trap to shake us out. So they can make it look like price is falling and they will cover at lower and lower prices to paper hands. FYI: In no way am i telling you to listen to me either but atleast do your research. 💎👐|2021-02-02 07:31:13
lq72vm|lat43j|lat43j|25|I'm normally a skeptical person, but I do believe GME will hit $1k when the squeeze happens, and this is just the hedge funds trying to get the price down through pre-market manipulation. I'm buying more.|2021-02-02 07:31:17

lq7z7f|lat43j|lat43j|28|THe people on here that are trying to get you to sell are just using scare tactics.   Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again|2021-02-02 07:39:09

Then they coordinate an attack with every other news media station to publically announce that GME was a losing battle, therefore manipulating the stock and encouraging most people to move out of it.  The stock is what it is now because of the media. I have NO IDEA what will happen moving forward, but I just cannot believe how ironic that the people who "wanted to save us" are ultimately the reason this shit happened in the first place.

lq837h|lat43j|lat43j|11|IMO, the real question with the future of $GME lies in broker transition. With buy limits in place at Robinhood and other brokerages, our crayons have been removed by an overzealous teacher. The Apes cant draw any more pictures.  In order for the apes to continue to squeeze, we need the ability to purchase and to combat the short ladder and regular joe investors who are selling. This will take brokers who are accepting our buy bids. This process takes 4-6 days.  So how many of you switched brokers, when did you make the change, and when does your buying power open up again? Take the middle of this bell curve, and I would expect LARGE $GME gains once buying power returns  For me, it was last Friday, and I have been released into the wild today. Perfect time to buy the dip. $GME!|2021-02-02 07:40:07

lqfjs0|lat43j|lat43j|11| This is fucking terrible. I appreciate that Revolut have said it’s not their choice but man alive how are they controlling all of these platforms?!   FROM REVOLUT:  Trading Update for GME and AMC Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  While we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause, this is not a decision Revolut has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the stocks they make available. We will however keep you informed as and when this situation changes.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME nor AMC will appear in search. Please check the email we are sending out to all Revolut Trading Ltd customers for additional information about this situation.  Capital at risk. Share prices can go up as well as down and you may get back less than what you initially paid.|2021-02-02 08:38:26

lpzbyy|lat43j|lat43j|35|I can’t believe people are falling for these bullshit fake accounts. All the accounts commenting calling the GME holders and buyers stupid were made in the past few days. The hedge funds are playing with us and we’re all falling for it because we are stupid. This is our last chance to stick it to them. I don’t get why people don’t understand we literally can’t lose if we don’t sell. This group has 4x’d in members in the last 3 days there was bound to be a bunch of boys in the chats.

lpv45t|lat43j|lat43j|44|Listen here, retards. Shorts are not playing to break even, they want to win. They now switched from bots to interns in order to fear monger more. But it doesn't really matter. That prisoner dilemma they talk about is total bullshit, and here is why: In order to cover their shorts they need to BUY all the shares avaiable(including those held by other institutions) AND tens of millions more. When the squeeze happens you literally can say them i will sell you a share for 20k and fuck your wife and they will agree, because they have no choice. Short squeeze only ends when GME issue new shares to bail them out. And they are silent, they are not going to do so easily, because shorts fucked with them for years.  &#x200B;  Hedge funds are the ones who have prisoners dilemma actually, because they decided they will manipulate the market and try to profit from the situation. But once one HF decides to cut the loss, price will skyrocket and all others will go bankrupt. They are the ones that will have to buy from us, AND THERE IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH SHARES EVEN IF WE ALL(INCLUDING INSTITUTIONS) PAPERHAND.  &#x200B;  RC is silent because SEC will be all over him if he starts squeeze. But the fact that they didn't issue new shares yet telling us their want fuck shorts as much as we do.  &#x200B;  Not a financial advice. 150 shares in.|2021-02-02 05:14:26

lq8tb0|lat43j|lat43j|21|I wish half of you would just take a look at the volume. That would tell you everything you need to know. But half of you don’t even know what that means.  Edit to explain to the guy who commented asking what I mean:  Sure. Volume is used as a measurement to determine how many assets are being traded (it’s sometimes refered to as “changing hands”) in a given amount of time. The higher the volume, the more people are trading. This is incredibly important to keep track of right now because we are seeing the price go down, but volume go up, or remain relatively consistent. What this alludes to is that trading is happening at a massive scale. In the context of $GME, it appears to prove that hedge funds are basically swapping their shares with each other, buying each other’s shares for a penny cheaper than what it was bought for. They aren’t losing any money because the stocks are being traded amongst themselves, but to the market, it looks like the stock is being sold, driving the “demand” ie, price down.  They are doing this in hopes that people just look at the price of the share plummet, panic and sell. Then they can trade their shares and pump the price back up to what it was. Then sell and make a profit.|2021-02-02 07:46:21

Your diamond hands are good for holding more than just stocks, and those who are still clinging to this rocket have proven that their ape-like grip will hold onto any space-bound vessel that has nothing to do with the market. I hope that we arrive together on the Apollo GME, but if we don’t I know we’ll make it at different times on different vehicles and I can’t wait to see you boys and girls on the big cheese in the sky.

lqajec|lat43j|lat43j|21|Obligatory 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀  The current price of the stock is significantly lower than its value. The purpose of ladder attacks is to SCARE PEOPLE AWAY more than it is to truly reduce the value of a stock. The only thing that will reduce the value of this stock is if actual shareholders, or us, sell, and if you sell now, you are doing just that. There is clearly one place to go from here and that's to hold. It'll take longer, but the squeeze will come.  TL;DR: DON'T FALL FOR THEIR TRICKS! HOLD GME!|2021-02-02 08:00:44

lqrv6i|lat43j|lat43j|20|Guys, this stock isn’t rising until at least the end of the week. You have to understand the weight of what Robinhood has done by locking buy orders of GME. RH is a HUGE platform of traders. Millions and millions of traders are on RH. Buys are stalled because no one CAN buy so the price will fall. Anyone who is ditching RH so they can change brokers and buy GME will not have access to their funds for about a week or longer while the transfer is pending. So buys are currently locked in limbo until people finish moving to another broker or RH lifts buying restrictions (which I wouldn’t count on).   All you can hope for is enough people took action to ditch RH as soon as they pulled their shit. Either that or pray RH lifts buying restrictions. Until then the price will likely keep falling. Just try to find the bottom and get in cheap if you feel confident in the rebound.|2021-02-02 09:52:28

lq71kv|lat43j|lat43j|9|The prices have dipped to these levels already in the last few days and bounced back. This is pre market pressure where volume and participants are low to drive down price.

lq73tx|lat43j|lat43j|11|I hate having to remind everyone that these are not real prices. Buffets quote: "Markets are here to serve you not instruct you" turn off your devices and stay calm and collected. This is far from over. Its basic math and supply and demand. They are using massively low volume as a trick to get you to sell. Look up the VW squeeze. Literally the same scenario playing out. They are using a bear trap to shake us out. So they can make it look like price is falling and they will cover at lower and lower prices to paper hands. FYI: In no way am i telling you to listen to me either but atleast do your research. 💎👐|2021-02-02 07:31:32
lq76ro|lat43j|lat43j|11|Just bought 10 more at 135.  If you bought in at any number higher than what you are seeing and plan to hold, it is in your best interest to buy more now to lower your overall share value while also raising the price back up.

lqhair|lat43j|lat43j|10|Revolut is pulling a Robinhood move  Revolut  won't allow you to buy GME or AMC - they claim their US broker-dealer DriveWealth won't let them due to increased capital requirements set by  the DTC. If true, this is a shit move the government took to protect the  hedge funds and not the real people.  Also eToro is closing positions and won't allow you to buy more than 25 shares.  Where  can i actually buy GME in Europe? Trading 212 are no longer taking any  clients, can't sign up to Degiro...

Let’s say you start seeing it unfold in front of you, and the outcome of you losing becomes more & more likely. You are screwed, that realization sets in, what do you do?  Now, imagine if the system could be manipulated enough to cause the opposition to believe they will lose, thus helping you avoid some, if not all of your debt, wouldn’t you do everything you could to make that happen? Every person that folds because of fear is one less person you have to pay. Ignore the fear, HOLD.  This is a made up story, I’m stoopids|2021-02-02 09:03:25

Movies are lined up all across the country and this is going to be a great stock to own as I'm sure so many have missed going to the movies. Ticket sales and experience after Covid will be a no brainer in my opinion.  good luck to all - lets see what NOK and GME are Upto by end of day -|2021-02-02 09:15:21

lqmhp7|lat43j|lat43j|9|💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌💎💎💎 Now that I got your attention, listen up:  The HFs got some fancy illusions, but thats all they are. Some fancy tricks, mind fuckery and slander.   Like some high school peer pressure bullying bullshit, only instead of your lunch money they're going after your investments (which for a lot of us isn't a whole lot more proportionally, myself included).   In my experience, bullys cover their fear with threats. Thats what this all is right now. EMPTY THREATS. They are desperate and scared cause now the whole playground is on to them and they about to get their asses WHOOPED!  They're acting like we never took a hit before, like we're scared of a little scuffle cause they don't live in the streets we grew up on. They're SCARED of being broke and eating ramen daily to make ends meet. MOTHER FUCKERS DONT KNOW WE ALREADY THERE LIVING IT!   They saw fearlessness last week and are trying to break us of that. What they don't get is that we aren't fearless, WE ARE JUST RETARDED AND STOCKS GO BRRRRR!!   Its courage they see, my fellow autists, and these scared lil bitches don't get it.   We don't see each other behind our screens and monitors but I see the numbers and they don't lie. We are together, I am here with you all and you with me. The WORLD is with us.  Even my wife's boyfriend Brad is with us and he only eats the yellow crayons (which as we all know is the worst flavor).  We've got some real diamond hands here boys, apes that have literally seen MILLIONS in loss and they are STILL HERE! So grab your fucking balls, quit your bitching, and stock up on these juicy dips cause the HF assholes thought a DISCOUNT SALE was gonna have you running away! This isn't financial advice, this is LIFE ADVICE. Dont be a pussy if someone knocks you down on the playground, dust off and fuck em up!  💎🙌🚀👨‍🚀|2021-02-02 09:20:34

lqqxzb|lat43j|lat43j|9|Almost 3x Buy Orders to Sell Orders  https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml  Yeah really seems like a selloff driven dip. They're spending hundreds of millions to take out the price with ladder attacks. They're leveraging 'investor media' to spook people. They want people to think its over so they can close. They're artificially gating the market to prevent the meteor.   I'm not here because I think it's impossible for us to lose. I'm here because I think if there's any group of people in the world that can HOLD THE LINE and WIN, its this one. They will cheat the system to try and beat us, because the slaps on the wrist from SEC et al are less than they stand to those on these positions. But they can't cheat forever.

lq1f5e|lat43j|lat43j|33| **TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedgefunds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.|2021-02-02 06:34:42

lq2vcn|lat43j|lat43j|29|For the people who are confused about the after hours price drop, it is the hedge funds selling it back and forth to each other making the price drop.

lq3qc0|lat43j|lat43j|26|The pessimism here is very telling. It's clear that WSB has been attacked by bots and shills for the hedge funds trying to divide and conquer. It seems to be working. Look at the charts and the level 2. It's obvious that the hedge funds are short laddering GME right now. I firmly believe they will continue to do so with relative ease for a few more days. This is a test of fortitude at this point. If you believe in the DD, and you like this stonk, then do what your heart commands. I'm no financial advisor and this isn't a recommendation to buy or sell. All I'm saying is remember, Ape Together Stronk!

Started to read why you all started this group and said I'm all in.  I don't know your terminology yet but i am learning.

lq7ti4|lat43j|lat43j|27|This is probably going to get buried, but whatever.  I saw yesterday that one of the hedge funders deleted his Twitter account because he was cyberbullied so badly. We all need to remember, we are a very powerful group fighting for a noble cause.  Keep in mind, you, yes you, are a representative of all 8 million of us.  In this virtual battle, we are not a hapless militia stiking out at anyone and anything. WE  ARE  AN  ARMY. Strong, united, honorable. We fight for a good cause.  The hedge funders have stooped to calling us names and spreading lies. We are better than that.

But they still have to buy them and they need them from us. When they start buying the price will go back up!  ITS A SCARE TACTIC, don’t fall for it.|2021-02-02 09:47:15

lq0675|lat43j|lat43j|18|To all of you who bought high and not in a mega retarded way (margin, money you need right now): if you’re thinking about selling, don’t. Seriously don’t.  I’m not saying this can’t go tits up but if you sell you lock in your losses. Since you didn’t buy leveraged products you can hold as long as you want and if you’ve actually done some research into the long term value play you’ll realize that there’s still much to gain even if the squeeze doesn’t happen. Then it becomes a matter of switching perspective and just seeing this a “boomer” long term investment.   Additionally I do still believe there’s still a lot of squeeze potential. So by not selling you don’t lock your losses and there’s a 2 way potential win for you. Either squeeze happens or you look at it from a longer term investment POV and you will gain in the longer term. The second one I personally have a high conviction rate on.  This is ofc not me telling you what to do or financial advice but I feel like it’s worth mentioning.  I like the stock (also long term) 🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-02 06:20:04

lq1shf|lat43j|lat43j|19|If you’re not willing to see GME at $100, this game is not for you. Because that will likely happen today. I’m a bag-holder and will stay regardless but I’m just telling it like it is. Typically, traders love whole numbers like $100, $200, $300 and they basically use these numbers as “support” so I expect $100 will be the ground from now on while the rocket refuels.  I’m not surprised that many of you noobies/inexperienced people thought you could make a bunch of money really quickly. That’s what the media made this look like. And that’s where they got us.... as soon as we reached peak media attention, that’s when the price stopped surging. Look where were at now. Not much media attention anymore and noobies/inexperienced traders are abandoning ship. I smell rocket fuel.|2021-02-02 06:38:48

lqcp4w|lat43j|lat43j|8|Academic short ladder question:  We're saying the hedge funds are (allegedly) rapidly selling small batches of stock to each other to drive the price down, right? But like, don't they also have to buy at the same time? And if they're shorting the stock, doesn't that mean they... don't have it? So to sell these batches to each other, are they borrowing more stock from the brokers? How does that work?  Can someone explain this confusing shit to me, so that I can write a book about it later?|2021-02-02 08:17:50

lqjxpr|lat43j|lat43j|9|how a ladder attack works  asshat #1: "hey #2 want to by my stocks?"  asshat#2: "sure sounds good"  \#1 sends 50m of stocks to #2,  a mass selling of stock and drop of price  public sees the 50m sell off, drop in price and sells their shares. this drops price more  \#2 now gets a discount price from publics fear, and makes money sending back to #1  \#2 send the money back to #1, profiting off the fear of crashing stocks.  mind you, when you sell during a ladder attack you are feeding the hedges, when you buy, you take money from them  &#x200B;  the only way to attack a ladder attack is buying during the dip. This increases the price when asshat #2 goes to send #1 the money back, ->hedges lose money|2021-02-02 09:04:43

I bought almost everything on Robinhood, is there a way to, like.. transfer my stocks? to another app that isn't so shitty? would I have to sell and then buy again somewhere else or can I create an account somewhere else and then transfer my data? I have no idea, I'm a dipshit who doesn't even understand the basics.  also I don't even know what that means but holding AMC and GME to the moon or whatever-the-fuck. **YAY HYPE** ^someone ^help ^me ^plz ^tho|2021-02-02 09:29:23

lqrk0b|lat43j|lat43j|9|A trader or investor always has the option to hold and still coming out ahead in the long run.  As long as the stock is not sold, you still own and hold that piece of the company.   Even if GameStop didn’t make a dollar off this, which they had to, the publicly has given the company a new life and the possibility of not following the likes of Blockbuster. If they harness this movement accordingly, there could be a day soon that adds in the actually value of the prices of the past week.   Again, if you got in at $14 a share and bought 3000 shares, you have a long ways to go before you are even closing to losing anything. As long as you do not sell, a loss cannot be claimed because you still own those shares.|2021-02-02 09:50:42

I think we all have to realise that this will not play out how we thought it would. That doesn't mean it still can't squeeze, there is a very real possibility that it will. Do not get pulled down by all the sad bears but make up your own mind.  For me, it's clear that some big money is on 'our' side. I think the low volume indicates that shorts can't possibly have covered. Even if they have covered to 50% or so, that is still a really high number.  I will see this play out until the end because I can.|2021-02-02 05:45:26

You invested money you could afford to lose, or to fuel the rocket to the moon.  What are you going to tell to the future generations? "Uhh the price dropped a lot so I shat my panties and took a 60% loss" ? Is this how you want to be remembered for?  Stay strong! Hold stronger!  Also, the current price is less than the bullish price on www.gmedd.com so if you want to buy more, it still counts as retarded long term investing|2021-02-02 08:26:26

lqqn5d|lat43j|lat43j|19|Listen to Mark Cuban.  “Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular   So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.”|2021-02-02 09:45:29

We are letting them destroy companies when we sell. GME is obviously overvalued and holding is a point of principal for the other small timers like BB and AMC who have viable business opportunities. BB has amazing new 5G tech and AMC will be perfectly fine post pandemic given the chance. It is not FAIR to let these companies fall because those fucks want to pick at their carcasses.

I wanted to join in and have something fun to distract myself after the past hell year we all lived through.                I never expected to get rich off this lol, but as someone from a poor background who's had to work hard to even manage minimum wage, any potential extra earnings would have an impact I don't think these hedgefund guys could ever fathom. Reading Steven Cohen saying he was "trying to make a living" infuriated me tbh. People down here struggle to pay for medicine or to be able to afford seeing therapists, while guys like him have more than enough for literally hundreds of lifetimes, and for *what*?

lq3awj|lat43j|lat43j|16|Everyone long GME who is now folding to the pressure is kind of donating their losses to shorts.  With the low trading volume and drastic price drops it is clear (if it is not to you, you should read some DD here or in r/investing) that the price drop is **artificial** and **initiated by the shorts** in order to scare away retail buyers and try to snatch up some shares with less losses for them. This also implies that a lot of stock is *locked* or else volume wouldn't be so low and volatility that high.  This means that people who are now giving in to pressure of having red numbers in their portfolio are donating their losses and shares to the shorts, which is exactly their hope. If you went ahead and Yolo'd in your money, at least inform yourself before panicselling.  **This is NOT financial advice**, just edjucated guesses and retard advice. My brain is as smooth as the panic sellers' brains. So base your decisions on good DD and other Information|2021-02-02 06:54:58

lq3m4q|lat43j|lat43j|17|It’s funny to see how the old guard of WSB reacts to the new guard. PLTR isn’t old, but so many here didn’t experience it. Everyday, the knights of palentard would rally and say it was only going up. And the less bullish bulls, there are no bears here, would say today is the  day it all comes crashing down. But by the end of it, nobody really knew. It was a free for all and mostly luck/timing/ 2% brainpower. What I’m trying to say is, we trust ourselves. Too many see loss porn and bail, and too many see stonks only go up. We need to embrace the veteran mindset. We are here because we know the risks. If you can’t hack it sell. If you can hold, don’t go checking the threads every 5 minutes and say omg one person said sell.   🚀|2021-02-02 06:58:10

lqbcyl|lat43j|lat43j|8|How do I explain to my dad that the people who brought out GME were not the same people who inflated the silver markets and that the same thing is possibly going to happen with AMC?  Like everyone I have been watching with interest and slight amusement about what you guys have done to the stock market. This type of thing is super interesting to me, in regards to the psychology of why people did it and how. However, the papers in the UK aren't explaining properly and there's lot of misinformation. Could some good wallstreetbetter explain to me what's going on and why? In both the context of GME, silver and AMC?  Thank you! From a very confused but intrigued redditor!|2021-02-02 08:07:30

" Trading Update for GME and AMC  Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.

lqo87t|lat43j|lat43j|8|Listen to Mark Cuban   “Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular   So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.”|2021-02-02 09:31:17

lq1z1r|lat43j|lat43j|16|   **TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedgefunds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands.

lqmob6|lat43j|lat43j|14|Not financial advice, just my opinion-  From the short standpoint, AMC hasn't happened yet. It would blatantly appear to be short ladder attacks to drive down the price in an effort to force a sell off, then to buy back up all at once at low cost. They want the panic to happen to make those with weak knees and potentially risky wallets to sell.  From the business standpoint- AMC has gotten a injection of cash from the Silver Lake deal, and stands to rebound after Covid even if not by leaps and bounds. Streaming is up, for sure, but movie theaters will be a hot business directly after the restrictions tighten. People who don't even like movie theaters will go just because they can again. There's a social aspect to the theater that will be in demand post restrictions. So the price you're seeing now doesn't even reflect the value of the company, in my opinion.

For those who bought around $200-400– Once the price comes up to around $300 people will sell because they are scared it won’t get back above the $500 peak and they’ll just be trying to get their initial investment back before it drops again.

lqn2ux|lat43j|lat43j|20|What's happening is quite obvious... They are pulling these short ladders to lower the price so THEY can buy.  All these bans on buying are just proof of that. They don't want us to start buying at this low price so they're pulling all the strings they can to make it harder for us.  Just by holding, we're giving them a huge middle finger.  &#x200B;  I'm retarded. Don't take advice from me. Financial or otherwise.|2021-02-02 09:24:12

lqj8fe|lat43j|lat43j|14|    Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.      Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.   AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.      How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.      Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  HOLD strong and place SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-02 09:00:27

Shares you own: you will be able to place sell orders  Pending buy orders: will be automatically cancelled at 3am on Wednesday, February 3rd (NZT)   New buy orders: will be automatically cancelled.  We want to be clear; this isn't a decision Hatch has made. It isn’t entirely unexpected, but it's a disappointing update.

lq063j|lat43j|lat43j|26|I have been looking at the datasets my whole life and never before have I seen such a blunt data manipulation as in the case of GME and AMC. The patterns displayed are almost exactly the same since yday. This should not be possible in the free market.   So much money is at stake here for the hedge funds that any potential fines for manipulating the market are probably insignificant to them at this point.   There was similar case for maritime piracy years ago. It was much more beneficial for the maritime industry to pay ransoms (millions of dollars) to the pirates rather than accruing fines for not delivering the cargo on time. This obviously led to the rise in piracy.    In order to dissuade companies from paying ransoms, US government had to upgrade the status of piracy to terrorism. Hence, any company paying ransoms to the pirates would technically be supporting terrorism (whole new level of jailtime and fines for the law breakers).   Unless sth like that happens, hedge funds will keep manipulating the market as they do now. If we all manage to hold, we might just punish them enough to do that. Keep strong, hold, buy the dip.

Because to truly succeed, you have to put your blood, sweat, and tears on the line after a hard days work lose some, THEN BUY MORE???? It doesn’t make sense to the rational brain! The diamond hand meme is truly a metaphor for what nuts it takes to be a hardcore investor. Melvin and his buddies have been doing this for a looong time and didn’t make their billions from being stupid and weak. They are smart and know how to play this psychological game better than anybody. Look how impatient we are! They figured they could lie to the public, that we would watch prices dwindle, and they would get out with minimal damage a week or two! HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE PUSSIES!!! You’re going to throw away this once in a lifetime movement after a week? The stock price is HIGHER than a week ago with plenty of billionaire shares waiting to be dumped on our poor little heads! The wealth gap is ridiculous and THIS is the only way we are going to change hands! By putting our money where our mouth is! By beating them at their own game! Lack of the drive to do so is how the poor stay poor!! SHORT TERM PAIN FOR LONG TERM GAIN is the basis of investing! Can you be psychologically tough enough to make this happen??

AMC stock as of January 29th, 2021 has a short interest percentage of 78.97%.  HOLDING 🙌 💎  According to Marketbeat  AMC ENTERTAINMENT (NYSE:AMC) SHORT INTEREST DATA  \*\*Current Short Volume:\*\*44,670,000 shares  \*\*Previous Short Volume:\*\*38,990,000 shares  **Change Vs. Previous Month:**\+14.57%|2021-02-02 06:37:28
lq2a96|lat43j|lat43j|23|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover|2021-02-02 06:44:09

lqqcox|lat43j|lat43j|28|Now is the time, Buy Buy But AMC.   We are being told by an insider, hedge funds have been told if the price goes back up they are on their own. I can’t say more, probably a bit risky to say anything at all but if people knew how weak of a position these people are in you would be buying twice as fast. There was an emergency meeting on Sunday, other players are more worried about legal consequences & political retribution by law changes being thrown around, they are worried if they manipulate the market anymore it will cause them to loose more money in other loopholes they don’t want looked into. (Alphabet)Google has said they will not be envolved at all... if robinhood’s app star rating goes to 1 you know I am telling the truth...   When all of this comes out you will be shocked at how close we are to destroying these hedge funds. Buy Now!

lqqhew|lat43j|lat43j|12|Mark Cuban says:     “Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular  So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.”|2021-02-02 09:44:33

lpukuq|lat43j|lat43j|28|One more time before I go to sleep because I can't stand this shit.  There are comments every 10 min about short interest on GME being 226%.  FINRA has short interest reported at 226% BUT THIS SHORT INTEREST IS FROM JANUARY 15TH. Finra reports SI twice a month. They reported again on the 29th but that wont be avaible to public until Feb 9th.  https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest#:~:text=FINRA%20requires%20firms%20to%20report,equity%20securities%20twice%20a%20month.  And no- just because the page you are looking at says "last updated today" doesnt mean new short interest information got reported. They upload the basic information on those pages like price/bid/ask daily, but short interest only gets reported twice a month.  GME gang whining about disinformation yet cant stop posting it. Stop posting shit that might actually make the dumbest among us dump money in on bogus info.  nobody knows the current exact SI rate. firms/people can make projections and even collect data on it but finra is a goverment backed organization that puts in the work to collect this data from firms and release it to the public. they put it out twice a month.|2021-02-02 05:06:48

lq15at|lat43j|lat43j|28|**TLDR: Wall Street and Mevin drive the price as low as possible so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedgefunds have to make bets at the start of  the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.   Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.|2021-02-02 06:31:36

lqq0hh|lat43j|lat43j|49|If you're an inexperienced trader and you're repeating things you hear on reddit to try to get people to buy/hold GME, you've become the thing you swore to fight.   You're playing with other people's money, and trying to manipulate their decision making. That's what you claim to be against, yet you are actively doing the same thing.   If GME is going to the moon, you don't have to spam it. You don't have to convince people. It'll happen. If this thing goes tits up, and you were part of the brigade telling people not to sell, you should feel bad, because you fucked with other people's money. You pretended to be an expert, and people believed you. That's a shitty thing to do. Bottom line.  I've been on WSB for years, and I've never told anyone to buy, sell, or hold anything. And it's something I rarely saw until recently, and now it's every post. This is some nefarious shit, and you need to understand how much you can fuck up people's lives doing shit like this.|2021-02-02 09:41:48

Are we the one's panicking or them. They are trying everything in their power / media to change the course of the rocket ... They are running around like chickens with no heads.

lqi9au|lat43j|lat43j|13| I think our odds are good of winning this tug of war with the shorts guys. Ladder attacks continue to bring prices down which short firms want so that if we decide to sell they can collect our stocks at low prices. They want all the stock back they owe brokers, but they can’t win if we never sell no matter how low the price. Whether that’s $0, 19 cents, or $1. If you sell your stock in GME or AMC you’re only suiciding and negging. Remember that we can put in limit orders for lower prices to ensure we get the stocks we want during these ladder attacks(which will inevitably happen) but as long as we hold we keep our position in this tug of war. Ladder attacks are a double edged sword that we can use to our advantage to buy more stock at cheaper prices    to hopefully and eventually buy up any and all the stock game stop has to offer(most of the reddit community knows this by now). The only hand short firms have right now is manipulation whether that’s through media, numbers fudging(ladder attacks) , and ultimately emotional manipulation(if you’re emotionally invested in this). Don’t let your emotions make you sell. This may carry on for a few weeks to come, but eventually we’ll own all the stock and we’ll see a big payout.  BUY BUY BUY at the price you want while you can. This is opportunity! I wanna say this is a prep week.|2021-02-02 08:54:38

lpvr9w|lat43j|lat43j|16|Repost from another WSB thread:    Hi, I’m a young swedish retail holder of 4 GME shares, which is a lot for a poor schmuck like me. Holding til the end of time🦍🦍💎✋✋, but as the retard I am, some things still aren’t clear as a summer day to me. Would be grateful if one of you could put my mind at ease on several issues so that my holding makes atleast some mathematical sense. Here goes:  Q1: What if Melvin Cap files for bancruptcy tomorrow? What happens then? Does anyone have to buy back the shares or is the stock value going down to zero?  Q2: Aren’t the premiums that the shorts have to pay dependant on the stock price, be it artificial? Someone said that closing above 320$ friday was a huge milestone, how is that so if the stock price simply does not matter?  Q3: I’ve heard alot of talk about ’days to cover’ and supposed expiration dates. Could someone clear that up for me? Could they keep paying premiums forever (if they had enough capital), and if so is the case: could we not reach a cut-off point in the near future wereby it will be more costly to cover their shorts, than to keep paying premiums until they have to file for bancruptcy?  Q4: If the scenario of Q3 happens, would that not mean that the stock stops to make economical sense?  Grateful for any response! TO THE MOON🚀🚀|2021-02-02 05:23:24

lpxiu5|lat43j|lat43j|11|Personally, I think they are now even playing an even more dangerous game. All those options expired last friday and they need to buy T+2 business days. They CLEARLY DID NOT BUY yesterday, but still need to buy all those options back. My guess is that they delayed buying back on purpose to cause as much of fear as possible. There are 2 options now: they will buy today during daytime, or let it completely run its course and have them forced into buying (dont believe they will do it that risky, as then they will have no control on the price)|2021-02-02 05:47:07

Buffets quote: "Markets are here to serve you not instruct you" turn off your devices and stay calm and collected. This is far from over. Its basic math and supply and demand. They are using massively low volume as a trick to get you to sell. Look up the VW squeeze. Literally the same scenario playing out. They are using a bear trap to shake us out. So they can make it look like price is falling and they will cover at lower and lower prices to paper hands.

They will give me a couple months on the house (they also are down on GME at this moment). So as long as GME/AMC go up again in the next few months, I'm A-OK.

lqki8m|lat43j|lat43j|11|EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻  ”The volume is low”.  What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.  Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.  In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.  So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already.

lq2koe|lat43j|lat43j|21|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover|2021-02-02 06:47:19

lq8bfz|lat43j|lat43j|22| A COMPLETE explanation of EVERYTHING. This sums up everything. SHARE. LIKE.     What is short selling:     Shorting, or short-selling, is when an investor, (hedge fund) borrows shares (from a broker), and immediately sells them, hoping he or she can scoop them up later, (buy them back), at a lower price.     In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock (borrowing from a broker Like Robin hood etc.) or other asset that the investor (hedge fund manager) believes will decrease in value by a set future date—>the expiration date. The investor (hedge fund manager) then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay the market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting that the price will continue to decline and they can purchase them at a lower cost.     Brokers (Robinhood, Webull, etc) get paid interest on those shares they lent to the investor (hedge funds) for the duration the investor holds those borrowed funds. The lender (broker > RH or Webull etc.) can request that the investor (hedge fund) return the shares whenever they want. They will typically do this when they see a massive spike in the share price. They can ask the investor (hedge fund) to return the shares at any time, whether it is a loss, or a gain for them. The investor (hedge fund) can continue to "double down" and borrow shares, provided the broker (RH etc) allows them to. They are typically pal's and work together behind the scenes (hence share purchase restrictions....and why you need to avoid these platforms.)     What happens if the price goes down:     If the price goes down below the price set at the expiration date, the Hedge Fund will make profits by the difference. Ex: Friday was $8.63. If the price closed at $1.63 on Friday, the hedge fund would have made a profit of $7/share that they shorted. This is why you see hedge funds act on negative news, or create negative news, to drive share prices down - so they profit. This is what WE are sick and tired of.     If the price goes up:     If the price goes up, the lender (Broker / RH etc) can ask the investor (hedge fund) to return the shares at a loss. The investor (hedge fund) will have to pay the lender the difference in price between the shorted price and the current market price. Example: Friday closed at $13.26. Expiration price was $8.63. The investor (hedge fund) could either buy as much as they can now and return the shares at the difference (loss) of $4.63 per share, or they can continue to short - provided the lender has not requested they return the borrowed shares. This is where the waiting game comes in. They may not want to pay that loss if they feel they can continue to short and believe they can manipulate the price down - this is where their scare tactics and selling pressure come into play.     Remember - you (we) own the shares they need to desperately buy. If they scare you into selling, this gives them the opportunity to buy your shares at a much lower price than what they would have to if we hold them and refuse to sell them at that lower price they've manipulated it through.     How do hedge funds manipulate share prices or apply selling pressure: (watch the video to understand)     VIDEO: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4)     Warning, watching this video may infuriate you even more as you see how these guys manipulate to take the average Joe's money.     \- they make the "impression" the stock is down and instill fear.... fear of losing your hard earned money. This will make you sell (they win).     So what do we do:     \- buy.   \- hold.   \- buy more.     What will the share price jump to?     Nobody can determine this or know this. Stop asking. What is the potential? The potential is indefinite, technically speaking. Technically, their exposure is indefinite but unlikely.   Will we see $20, $40, $60, $100, $200, $300, $500 ?   The quick answer is yes - that is possible. What does it depend on? It depends on us buying the shares, owning the shares, and holding the shares. If you sell them at $15, then they will buy them and that will be the price of the share. If you hold, and nobody sells until $100, then the price of the share will be $100. If everyone HOLDS and refuses to sell until $200, the price will then be $200 as someone agrees to sell for $300.     This is why it's important to hold. Buy, and hold. Do not sell.     How long will this take:   Options are expiring next week again. As options expire, hedge fund investors have increased pressure to buy back shares (cover). When they buy back shares, this creates an ongoing never ending effect of the price going up. The more the price goes up, the more pressure they get to buy back quicker, on and on. Keep in mind - the longer this goes on, the more interest they are paying on those shares. They will eventually crack and have to pay through the nose. I hope this helps everyone.|2021-02-02 07:42:05

lqr47f|lat43j|lat43j|23|For people who need a boost this is from Cuban’s AMA on why the stock is plummeting:  Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular   So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.|2021-02-02 09:48:13

lq130j|lat43j|lat43j|14|**TLDR: Wall Street and Mevin drive the price as low as possible so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedgefunds have to make bets at the start of  the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.   Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.|2021-02-02 06:30:51

lq0dxv|lat43j|lat43j|26|It’s hard to take any negative comments seriously. Honestly, to me, they just scream “look at me, I missed out on GME,” or “I pulled out while I was ahead, and to justify my decision while also coping the FOMO of not being on board if this thing moons, I will try and tear other people down as well.” Like when a balding dude tells you that you need a haircut, when really he just doesn’t want you to have what he can’t have. None of those types of comments were here just days ago, either.  Edit: Sorry balding dudes, I just found that to be a perfect analogy.|2021-02-02 06:22:36

There are enough of us here that will hold to zero to continue the fight. When you gamble in WSB, you choose 0 or 🌕 when you put your money on the table. If you stick around longer, you will get better at deciding which plays are right for you and when to get in and out. I say this as someone down $20k from my high a few days ago...we’re all retarded here. You need to make your own decisions in your own best interests.|2021-02-02 06:41:43
lq2f1w|lat43j|lat43j|26|Good (American) morning Kings and Queens, I come bearing premarket tidings: GME is selling for ~$159 here in Norway 🇳🇴 (I'm on a 15 min delay since I won't pay my broker for real time updates).  What does this mean?  It means 💎HOLD💎YOUR💎GROUND💎! Hold your ground!  Citizens of Eurasia, of America, of Africa, of Oceania - my sisters and brothers 🌍🌏🌎, I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me 💔. A day may come when the courage of the people fails and we break all bonds of fellowship ☠️, but it is NOT this day!  An hour of wolves 🐺 and shattered shields 🛡, when the price of the GME comes crashing down, but it is NOT THIS DAY!

lq7tuy|lat43j|lat43j|27|FUCKING HOLD  Words of u/pxzib   The price will be manipulated down hard even if nobody is selling. They can push the price down to $1, the short squeeze will take place either way. And if people are holding, they need to offer up incredible prices in order for someone to at least sell them, so they can cover the shorts. They NEED to buy these stocks, at whichever price we will sell them for. We literally decide which price they will buy the stocks. But that requires people to hold.  Holding short positions costs money, so they can't hold shorts forever. So as long as people are holding and price is stable or going down, they are bleeding massively. At some point they need to close their shorts. They have massive amounts of money though to sit this out. We are talking weeks and perhaps even a month. That's why it's so incredibly important that people just fucking buy and hold. Buy these stocks only with money you can afford to lose. Be ready to see it plummet to zero, before it fucking skyrockets.  A short squeeze WILL occur, if people hold. The entire system is set up this way. They literally cannot escape. And we are taking advantage of this situation. We have them trapped in a corner. And they NEED to get through us if they want out of this suffocating corner. They will literally die if they stay in this corner for too long.|2021-02-02 07:37:52

lpzqyi|lat43j|lat43j|10|There is an overview fro Marketbeat of the short interest and the number of days for the hedge funds to cover. You can see the biggest position to be covered will be in 2.5 days with a position of $11.96 billion. The price on record date is $193.60... so, in order for us to get the squeeze on this we need to keep the price above this until Friday morning. Just two and a half more days of diamond hands before this rocket ship takes off. Buy the dips and stay cool. The hedge funds will try to mess with us by short selling stock to each other to drive the price down. If you look at live trading volumes of GME, you will see that it happens in EXACT blocks of 100 shares at a time. These are not average investors, but rather an automated algorithm making the trades to cause us panic. Stay strong #WSB gang. Data from Marketbeat, go to website, then type in GME and slide over to short interest to see for yourself. It may seem like this rocket ship is a dud right now, but trust me... there is fuel in the tank. We just gotta light the spark to blow it off to the moon.

lqjy6o|lat43j|lat43j|10|What % of GME is owned by us retailers + Fidelity + Vanguard? Isn’t there another large % investor with the word black in the name that I’m missing?  Anyway; It’s evident the HFs are playing beyond dirty to cover their shit: short ladder attacks, forging docs promoted by MSM, other stock manipulation tactics, etc; all in an attempt to get us to sell.   Worst case scenario what? they cover their shorts and dump their shares at record low numbers. I’m not sure how this works cuz I’m a retard, but if the +8M of us (soon to be +10M by Friday) each spent $100-125 from our paycheck/unemployment that’d be a $1B asset purchase to scoop all the GME stock into our sparkling 💎🙌. Set meme-sell-limits, and price 🚀 due to unavailability. All I know how to do is buy dips and hold. 🦍💪   WSB has already made history and proven it's potential to rival/surpass the power of HFs to a point where they have to scramble to screw over the little guy, triggering all their booby traps on the way down their oiled ladders.  Could we at that point (or maybe even now) team up with GME and the large shareholders FD & VG, and make a case to the Supreme court to ban short trading? Or at least ban shorting GME or motion to make it illegal? If the SEC continues to do nothing isn’t this out next line of recourse?  I fucking love this stock, see it’s inherent value not just in todays gaming market, but in the future with VR/AR; how that tech is already revolutionizing gaming, porn, subscription biz models, etc: all through GME and their investments.|2021-02-02 09:04:48

lqajr4|lat43j|lat43j|19|A Poem for Diamond Hands:  It was February 2nd, all across the lands,   retail investors pondered their Diamond Hands.  See, there was a investment stock called GME,   where shorting hedges thought they could print money for free.  r/wallstreetbets had interest in GME too,   They're only day traders, psh... what could they do?  The GME win would be a fight, Retail would need to be strong.   Some investors bought short, some investors bought long.  Some thought: "Buy the Dip!" Some thought: "Hold!" Paper hands thought "Sell"   No matter the outcome, there would be a great story to tell.  And as I watch the ticker, GME at a 5 day low   asking myself, Will it bounce?  Where will it go?  Would a win be long from now, would it be soon?   Win or Lose, Diamond hands say: "GME, to the MOOOONN!!!!"|2021-02-02 08:00:48

lq8jeb|lat43j|lat43j|6|Dark Pools.  If the shorts are out, start asking questions about this so we can get answers.   What are dark pools?  Were these dark pools used to shield them, and keep information we needed to keep trading secret?  > Dark Pools owned by the biggest names on Wall Street – such as Goldman Sachs’ Sigma X2, JPMorgan Chase’s JPM-X, UBS’ UBSA, Morgan Stanley’s MSPL, and Credit Suisse’s Crossfinder — have been making tens of thousands of trades in the shares of GameStop on an ongoing weekly basis.  FINRA, Wall Street’s highly compromised self-regulator, reports the Dark Pool data on a stale basis, two to three weeks after the trading has occurred. It is then lumped together for the whole week, rendering it useless in terms of monitoring price manipulation  ​  https://www.sgtreport.com/2021/01/gamestop-shares-dark-pools-owned-by-goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-ubs-et-al-have-made-tens-of-thousands-of-trades/    > One of the main advantages for institutional investors in using dark pools is for buying or selling large blocks of securities without showing their hand to others and thus avoiding market impact as neither the size of the trade nor the identity are revealed until some time after the trade is filled. However, it also means that some market participants are disadvantaged as they cannot see the orders before they are executed; prices are agreed upon by participants in the dark pools, so the market is no longer transparent).[3]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pool  > U.S. Estimates show that it accounted for approximately 40% of all U.S. stock trades in 2017 compared with an estimated 16% in 2010.  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp|2021-02-02 07:43:59

lqb2j3|lat43j|lat43j|5|My theory on what could happen. Easy to read. :)  Hedgies  will continue with ladder attack drawing the attention of the other  shorts to increase shorted % of the float. Then when the price will be  at  \~60-80 USD they will open calls and long positions and start to  cover their short positions. With that, they will amortize their losses  and maybe even gain profit. If we are strong, we and hedgies will be  playing in the same team at the end game. Stay strong and hold.  I think  in the end retails shorter will pay the price and the last hedge fund  to start covering. Basically, the biggest fish will be fine because it  will trigger covering but the others will pay.|2021-02-02 08:05:06

lqc148|lat43j|lat43j|6|Stupid question. I had deposited money to robinhood prior to this whole debacle and the transfer was still pending even though Robinhood allowed me to use instant money. I bought options and then the whole thing with GME happened. I transferred to fidelity, and I can see my positions in Fidelity, but I am seeing a margin debit for around the amount of the pending deposit in robinhood. Once the deposit goes through, will the margin debit go away. I dont think the transfer has completed yet as it takes 3-5 business days.|2021-02-02 08:12:45

lqfdes|lat43j|lat43j|4|GME and AMC set to sell only on Revolut.  "Trading Update for GME and AMC  Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  While we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause, this is not a decision Revolut has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the stocks they make available. We will however keep you informed as and when this situation changes.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME nor AMC will appear in search. Please check the email we are sending out to all Revolut Trading Ltd customers for additional information about this situation.  Capital at risk. Share prices can go up as well as down and you may get back less than what you initially paid."  Update from Revolut  "Hi,  From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  What does this mean for me? You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on 2 February, 2021.  None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.  Why is this happening? When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners. This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.  When will they be available again to buy? This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out.

lql6jc|lat43j|lat43j|5|So is anyone else having repeated issues with Robinhood and posting limit orders?  Now before you ask no I’m not talking about hurr durr sell at 420.69, I mean more substantial ones like 2.5-5k.  Monday morning I had my order cancelled for 2.5k because it’s too ‘AgGrESsIvE’.  Monday night I play around and find the sweet spot is between 5k (which worked) and 5.25k which got rejected.  Now this morning they decided that 5k was acceptable last night but unacceptable today.  I sent Robinhood an email because I don’t stand to make ‘quit my job’ money from this shit scattering spectacle.  And I’d rather not get fired for constantly playing with RH at work.  But these knobs are making it difficult to try and protect myself if the great squeezening begins.  🙌💎|2021-02-02 09:12:29

lq2p9g|lat43j|lat43j|14|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost.

lq7uph|lat43j|lat43j|13|Looking at the pre market numbers im thinking now is a good time to buy to bring my average down and increase my shares. I make about 20k a year and didn't have much $ to spend last week so I've been sitting @ 2 shares but but today looks like a great opportunity to increase my position. To the people that think I'm retarded and bag holding, It's not even about the potential profit for me. It's about saying I was with all of you 💎🙌 🦍 until the end and even if it drops sub $50 I'm holding. I fully believe these brokerages are trying to cover up illegal stuff and if me holding 5 shares can make that harder for them to do, well they can buy them .... for $69,420.69 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕|2021-02-02 07:38:04

lpvuei|lat43j|lat43j|43|HOLD ON and DONT LET MELVIN TRICK YOU!  &#x200B;  Listen!   I'm deep in with 51 GEM shares @$280. I'm holding, cause I know the squeeze has to happen, BUT:  We need to stop talking about **a squeeze date**! Nobody knows when this will happen. It took about 4 - 5 Months to get the VW squeeze. So the GME squeeze could be very soon (this Friday) or very late (March or April) or whenever. **The important thing is to NOT demotivating each other buy promising squeeze dates.**   **You may ask why? I will share with you my thoughts:**  From a psychological perspetive (I'm no expert!), if I was Melvin, I would do everything possible to prove WSB on the promised squeeze dates wrong! I would manipulate the price (ladder attack) I wouldn't use any buy volume, I would use media prior to the promised squeeze date and so on.      **WHY would I do that?**  Easy: I would demotivate everybody in this group who has put in money he is not willing to lose and who expects the squeeze to happen tomorrow. I would scare everybody who needs the invested money next month to pay rent or other bills. I would bring all you guys to sell me your shares as cheap as possible. And some of us would do it, because the promised squeeze date wasn't delivered by us apes. I would also push other stocks to detract to from GME, and we are helping them with claiming wrong squeeze dates...  **With every promised squeeze date we generate more and more paper hands and Melvin slowly buys day by day 200 shares, 1k shares, 2k shares, 5k shares.**      Yes we do laugh about the low volume, but if every Melvin broker buys 1k shares for under $200 they are getting them cheaper and are avoiding the damn squeeze.  **AND I WANT MY DAMN SQEEUZE!! I promised my kitty a brand new tesla.**   So stop panic selling, educate yourself and stop promising SQUEEZE DATES!!! It happens when it happens!!  LETS SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND STAY STRONG TOGETHER. The squeeze will happen, if we stay strong.  WE NEED A LONG BREATH. Don´t listen to me I'm stupid as hell and just love this stock.|2021-02-02 05:24:36

lq4mlx|lat43j|lat43j|15|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  They drive it as low as possible, hence enticing more people to buy low, meaning they make more gains as they will bet for it to go up.  Melvin has to do this. You are plain dumb if you think they only work with gme. They need to make this money back to cover themselves as a company as a whole, not just gme loss. They had to take money for other investments to cover gme loss, so need to make money for other bets as well!!  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover  not financial advice.|2021-02-02 07:08:16

STILL, I was able to buy new shares premarket TODAY! Makes me so happy, especially with the DIP!!!  NOTE: RH code appears buggy with all their messages, e.g. I’ve gotten messages about orders being canceled but due to incorrect numbers or reasons.

WSB gets popular because the people who are here organically make the machine work, normies get FOMO, they join expecting immediate gains but they can't handle the violent volatility, psychological they're not prepared to trade or HOLD for the long-term. This is good. Go away if you don't belong here. GTFO! You water down our movement! The rest of us will HOLD like the autists we are!

lq4m6z|lat43j|lat43j|16|Listen, a decent credit score is worth more to you than whatever money you might make off of your 3 shares of GME or whatever. If you can’t afford to lose money, if it’s your mortgage/rent/student loan payment, **DO NOT** invest in speculative stocks. This isn’t a social cause, it’s a meme turned into a minor mass hysteria. You can very easily lose most or all of your investment.|2021-02-02 07:08:09

lqbpwa|lat43j|lat43j|14|I look at the ladder attacks and premarket pricing and all of the amazing explanations of what’s happening here and can’t help of think of the movie The Big Short except this seems the other way around... we know the shorts are worthless and the stock is good and they should have to fold their hands, admit that and pay us, but they’re doing everything they can to try to be stubborn and convince us to drop our stocks for cheap instead.  This is a game of who blinks first.  Whenever I watch that movie, it pisses me off and I don’t want to think our financial system is that, and certainly that it couldn’t still be that after 2008.  Fuck, I feel like I’m living it now, and I don’t even have a shit ton of money invested, maybe $3K at this point between GME & AMC.  Fuck hedge funds.  Fuck a rigged corrupt financial system.  Fuck anyone that says not to hold and not to like the stocks.  💎🙌🚀🪐|2021-02-02 08:10:20

lq08ud|lat43j|lat43j|26|There's 100% a lot of FUD on here now. Think some of it is well reasoned, they *could* have closed some of their short positions last week, a small squeeze *could* have happened last week. It's possible. BUT unless we get actual data it's all speculation.  As of **right now**, it seems more and more brokers are restricting buying **again**. An example from the UK:  https://twitter.com/freetrade/status/1356566554901626885  > **Our US execution partner** has restricted buys on $GME, $AMC, and $NOK today.  They've been strong armed by their **US execution partners.** Why are they again, like last thursday, halting buying on GME? IMO it's because they haven't closed as many short positions as some people think, they need to drive the price down AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE to do so.    Also freetrade aren't the only ones, I think I saw someone say australia/nz are doing it too? It could be the same few US execution partners halting buying on multiple brokers AROUND THE WORLD. Why? They're still in the shit imo.  This game is far from over.|2021-02-02 06:20:56

lq4oxm|lat43j|lat43j|19|Repost, because people need to understand:  To everyone that is scared, you need to understand something that is very important in order to sleep peacefully at night.  Imagine a hostage situation at a bank. 200 bank robbers are holding 3 people hostage inside the bank in a room where oxygen supplies are running low. The only way for the 3 people to get out is if they give away the code to a large safe in the bank, losing the bank all of their money.  Simple scenario right? Now I ask you this: Who feels more afraid, and who has power in this situation? That too, even for you smooth brained retards should be simple: Robbers have the power and the bankers are afraid.  This is what the situation is today. We are the robbers, and they are the hostages. WE ARE HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE. They have no way out AS LONG AS WE HOLD. If the 200 robbers just leave the bank they walk away unscathed. If they stay, they will have to give up the code sooner or later, because it is better than dying from asphyxiation.  That is what is happening, and therefore you need to know that as long as we all hold, we are good.  &#x200B;  Translation:  200 🦍surround 3 🐍that have many 🍌that 🦍want. 🐍has held 🍌for long time, no share 😟  🐍dies if no give all 🍌to 🦍because stronger 💪and manyer  🐍has to choose if want to keep 🍌and risk 💀, or give up 🍌so 🐍can keep being gross 🤢but with less 🍌  Is 🐍or 🦍at advantage?  🦍is at advantage.

lq5c43|lat43j|lat43j|14|What's the goal for $BB today? 🚀💎|2021-02-02 07:15:09
lq5icj|lat43j|lat43j|13|TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  They drive it as low as possible, hence enticing more people to buy low, meaning they make more gains as they will bet for it to go up.  Melvin has to do this. You are plain dumb if you think they only work with gme. They need to make this money back to cover themselves as a company as a whole, not just gme loss. They had to take money for other investments to cover gme loss, so need to make money for other bets as well!!  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover  not financial advice.|2021-02-02 07:16:48

This will happen multiple times a week, a day , or even in an hour. It may totally tank. It's a gamble, and a gamble you should not be playing if you don't have the disposable income to do so.   If you don't think that people are playing you, and that it's only you playing them, think again. Investors buy the dips and sell the peaks (it's what we do!), and your creating a pile of dips and peaks for us. All they need to do is set their investment platform to cruise control and they are off to tendie town.  I know I'll get flamed for this, but if you have made or are gambling with life-changing money on this deal and your guts are ripped up about the risk, you might want to take your GME tendies and look at something that's more stable- or for the "next" thing. Trust me, you don't want to live with a lifetime of "I should have". Source: I lost over a million dollars in 2002 because I was 21 and though I was a badass diamond handed retard who would retire a billionaire at 25. Turns out I was not a diamond handed retard, I was just a jackwagon who didn't know what a bubble was. Lesson learned.  If you are already wealthy, having the time of your life screwing with the establishment, or really don't care about the risk- well, then you belong here and are playing the right game. I'll see you fucks on the moon.|2021-02-02 08:08:10

Only few of them (aoc, Warren, Cruz, etc) talked about it. And since then nothing. How is it better than Trump? Biden said he will unite people but when reddit gave him a prefect chance to unite people he is ignoring it. Without government help it will be really difficult to win against hedge funds.  Call your representatives and tell them to start reacting to wall st bullshit immediately. They are just waiting for us to calm down and lose money.

You can have a bad outcome with a good process and a good outcome with a bad process. But-ideally-if you have a consistently good process you will have more good outcomes than bad outcomes.  So don’t just look at a trade and think “oh I made money I’m a genius, I’ll do the same thing next time,” or “I lost money I’m an idiot, I’m never doing that again.” You need to also examine what your reasoning was behind those decisions.

lq3f8q|lat43j|lat43j|16|This is reposted from the main page. The TRUE short interest in GME:  The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.  Here is what they did: Sources (S3 head): https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19 https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448 https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650  S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.  it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)  So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this: 400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8 That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.  Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float: 55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade "longs whose shares were borrowed away to short") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22  That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.  So 💎🙌🚀🌚🤑🥳|2021-02-02 06:56:12

lqa5qu|lat43j|lat43j|33|GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next  Hello all,  If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.  Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.  But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.  Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.  One of two things can happen to these people:  1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able 2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.  This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.  So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.  Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**  If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?  Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.  If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.  Another question to consider:  If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.  The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.  Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.  Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:  1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption. 2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.  **TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.  I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.  **EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.   **EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.|2021-02-02 07:57:37

lqaax4|lat43j|lat43j|4|German media write that a crash of short sellers would NOT lead to the collapse of the whole financial market:  "Because other hedge funds are also likely to be affected by the steep rise in Gamestop's stock price, fears of a general stock crash are now circulating. According to insiders, the losses of the hedge funds could amount to 20 billion dollars, according to the "Wall Street Journal". Indeed, if the funds could be forced to sell shares and other long positions to cover their losses on Gamestop, the prices of uninvolved companies would also be at risk of collapsing - which could trigger a conflagration, experts warn.   ...  Experts at the British Barclays bank, on the other hand, are optimistic that the turbulence surrounding Gamestop will remain local. In total, the volume of short sellers operating on Wall Street amounts to around 800 billion dollars. In the case of Gamestop and other stocks targeted by small investors and hedge funds, the volume is just $40 billion. Therefore, a global stock crash, as feared by some market players, is rather unlikely. From the point of view of chart technology, a form of financial analysis, there is also no cause for dramatization at present."  Doesn't that mean that if the worst came to the worst, Wall Street would drop those hedge funds like a hot potato? Or the opposite? What do you guys think?|2021-02-02 07:58:48

lqcre8|lat43j|lat43j|5|What is the real profit?  Fellow 🦍🦍, it just came to my mind. Imagine the whole profit if we win this battle. Is it appeasing your little apy brain? Isn’t that sweet idea delicious? Oh sure it is!   But imagine even greater satisfaction after years to come that you proved your nerves to be rock hard when the prices went down even to 15$ and then rise up to na amount I can’t even guess. Imagine the excited eyes of your grandchilndren listening to old grandpa „steelballs” telling again the story of an army of men who proved to have the strongest nerves in whole humankind history. It’s like 300 Spartans defending against hundrets of thousends of Persians but this time the odds remain on our side and we shall prevail! Fear no dips brothers for I say to you. We will hold it through and together end up in elysium! Just hold it!  Just kidding I don’t even know what I’m talking about, since I’m brainless ape. Feed me crayons.|2021-02-02 08:18:18

lqdg3p|lat43j|lat43j|4|So I have one share of GME ( I know it's not as impressive as some of the other apes but I try) I want to buy another half share but robinhood has disabled the purchase of fractional shares. But that's when I remembered you can still sell fractional shares. Is there anything to stop me from selling half of my current share and then buying a full one to bring my grand total to 1.5?   This would mean that anyone with one or more complete shares IS actually able to buy fractional shares on robinhood. I know that there are probably a LOT of poor people like me trying to play a bigger role in this but can't because they think they can't buy fractional shares but if this works apes can buy more banana....   If someone can prove my theory works I'll try to make a big post about it. I'll test when the market opens but I was wondering if someone has already done this and know it works.  P.S. This is not investing advice I am a purebred autist.|2021-02-02 08:23:32

lpvbm8|lat43j|lat43j|14|Yesterday as soon as the market opened, I bought 1.7 GME @ around 330 on eToro and noticed a minute later that eToro forced an unremovable stop loss on it. I couldn't remove the stop loss before GME fell drastically and eToro sold my share and made me lose 110$.  However, since the only stock I care about is GME, this only made it better for me because now I will be able to buy close to 2 shares of GME with the amount I was left with after the loss.

lq2uk2|lat43j|lat43j|14|TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover|2021-02-02 06:50:15

lpwkxr|lat43j|lat43j|24|It’s 0600 and most of America is asleep. High frequency trading computers are not. It’s been getting attacked since European markets opened hours ago. Driving price down so short sellers can cover their bets for less of a loss and minimize the squeeze on the day of reckoning. They can kick the can by failure to cover and in the meantime drive the price down. They’ll also, in turn, buy and hold long stock and calls just before the squeeze at the lower price they created. Then, cover their positions. Losing money in one hand, gaining it in the other. And initiating short positions at the peak when they know they have covered. To believe the mob has the upper hand is misleading. We can influence the terms. But they can do the same, as well as fully control the timing. Having capital to buy the dip will maximize profits. Those in early will reap the most. But we have no way of knowing in real-time when the positions have been covered, and thus, when to eject. They know instantly. For retail that’s a guessing game. Which is why the mantra, buy and hold prevails. In reality that will never happen. People will fall prey to a combination of greed and fear. And that will determine this outcome. Times are tough right now. For many, fear will outweigh any greed. Others, they have nothing to lose. And some just say fuck it. Only time will tell what those population proportions are. But even if 100% of retail bought and held, eventually the critical mass of short positions would be covered - purchases would stop. And prices would fall, rapidly. And still the outcry would be buy and hold to the moon. And all the way tumbling, the masses not realizing the peak had come and gone.  Best of luck to all in this.

If all the apes bought AMC during this dip we’d fuck the hedge funds and see massive sTonK gaInz to ThE mOon. Like Mark said, “strength in numbers is a thing.” Pull yourselves together and buy. Get AMC above $10 again and we’ll see the squeeze Thursday.   As much as loss porn is fun to see at the 10k+ level, I don’t want to see the little investors suffer. Apes together strong. Apes together keep AMC afloat.  Apes together change direction of arrow after lunch.  I am an Ape not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

lq3sav|lat43j|lat43j|13|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Melvin has to do this. You are plain dumb if you think they only work with gme. They need to make this money back to cover themselves as a company as a whole, not just gme loss. They had to take money for other investments to cover gme loss, so need to make money for other bets as well!!  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover  not financial advice.|2021-02-02 06:59:53

lqe5al|lat43j|lat43j|20|Why we're still winning, and why we're still going to the moon.   I've spent the past 5 fucking hours researching this shit and stumbled across some absolutely GAME CHANGING information that everyone should know about. This is a long read but bare with me, this is some important shit and it will make your diamond hands even diamondier.  > Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.  > In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.  > **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**  **This is what happened today with the price decrease**  Source: https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2009/34-60388fr.pdf - Section "II.

Regardless, the sentiment stands.*  shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.  # What's to be done?  Rule 204.  > Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.  You can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.  Gamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.  Edit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.  #SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.  Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.  #TL:DR  The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

lqoasv|lat43j|lat43j|6|"Why is the stock plummeting?"  " Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.   That then accelerates the selling.   Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular  &#x200B;  So what to do ?   If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.   Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.   I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street."|2021-02-02 09:31:42

lq5q0n|lat43j|lat43j|14|From an Atlanta based journalist who was originally against the whole GME play. https://www.facebook.com/500062484/posts/10158919384087485/?d=n   “I just changed my mind about GME. Sort of.  No, you shouldn't buy it, certainly not today, unless you're a millionaire willing to burn money in a protest, and you understand what's about to happen and can profit from other things that are about to happen as a consequence of the shorts unwinding their positions.   But if you have it, HOLD on to it for dear life, and if you love someone who has some of those shares, you should support them in their eventual losses. What you are doing is a service to America.  Goddamn it. They're right. And I get it now. Holy mackerel.  There is nothing -- NOTHING -- wrong with short selling a stock. That's not the problem. The problem is that the people who own the shares lent out the same stock more than once. It's like selling the same car to three different people. It's a fraud.  I've been trying to figure out how the heck these financial services firms have been able to perform the way they have through the pandemic with interest rates scraping along near zero. The answer, unsurprisingly, is that they're cheating.  You see, while the prevailing interbank interest rate is like 0.01 percent and the prevailing T-bill is at 2 percent ... interest earned on short sales is like a credit card rate. It's 18 percent.  And they're charging it multiple times on the same share of stock lent out for a short sale, which is a crime in black-letter securities law called naked short selling.  It's possible that the 140-percent short interest is a product of something more benign -- synthetic shares created by a cascade of short sales -- but I don't think Wall Street thinks that's the case.  GME's institutional investors -- primarily Blackrock, Fidelity and Vanguard -- are probably cheating. And when the short squeeze hits, they're going to be caught. It's a 2008-level scandal.  The risk to small investors is real. But it's more extensive than the risk to people holding GME: there's a fundamental problem with trading operations that is about to be exposed, that could create serious chaos across all the capital markets. I fear that things are about to get ugly everywhere.   I am not a financial advisor. I cannot and am not offering financial advice. I am, as they say, a hairless ape. But I just went 100 percent liquid.  The problem comes when brokers begin to make margin calls on the firms that are being squeezed. There really, REALLY aren't enough shares outstanding for the shorts to cover. The institutional investors, somehow, lent out more shares than exist. I dismissed that at first as a quirk associated with fractional share ownership, treasury shares and people selling short to people who then lent out the shares, in a cascade. But it's more fundamental than that.   The institutional owners apparently lied -- in violation of the law -- lending out the same shares more than once and collecting double or triple interest on the loans. In a low interest rate environment, brokers playing games there is entirely consistent with Wall Street's culture and history ... because the only way they would be caught is if there are a lot of "failure to deliver" reports hitting the SEC after shorts failing to cover.  If those shorts can't cover three days after a call, the SEC is alerted.   I suspect that Blackrock ($100 billion market cap), Vanguard ($6.2 trillion in assets), and Fidelity (I don't know) are very, VERY concerned about this violation become public, which is why Robinhood is able to secure a lot of operating capital on short notice and perhaps why they were pressured not to allow buying.   The next step, I suspect, will be for these institutional investors to simply place billions in the accounts of the short sellers, in order to prevent them from being subject to a margin call. Except, that should be the subject of an SEC investigation.   It explains why weird foreign billionaires are saying "yeah, I'll buy a million of GME, too!" They understand that they can make 100 times that back by shorting the financial services firms that will end up crushed once the short squeeze exposes the market malfeasance.   It is absolutely a gobsmacking financial moment, roughly equivalent to learning that mortgage CDOs were filled with trash and that the ratings agencies had been lying about their quality.   Because if they're double-lending GME, they were probably double lending everything else with a lot of short demand.

lq66cb|lat43j|lat43j|12|Hi Guys, not sure if anyone will see this. I'm new around here but I still want to suggest something. I want somebody to legally push a reinforcement wave to AMC, Game Stop, whatever the fuck you're all holding. I know you guys are saying "Buy and Hold" but it's been some time, we need a new message. "The reinforcements are coming" type message. A movement of people buying more stocks to raise the hold from falling. And kick some ass! "The Eagles have arrived", "Rohan has joined the battle", idk. You make the message. If you think this is a worthy suggestion.     If it works, we would bring more people to earn money, and the holders the guarantee that you have not BACKED DOWN. It would be a big mosh pit and a win for us all especially "public figures" who put thousands/millions on the line for this movement. Thank you for reading my suggestion.|2021-02-02 07:23:02

This is what they said   “Trading Update for GME and AMC Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.

lqihj3|lat43j|lat43j|4|Bought BDRBF, Bombardier has been bailed out by Canada, and sold its transportation industry (high speed hybrid rail) to Alstom. This lightens up their low demand high cost industry to play only the private jet market. They have a contract to provide to UTC (UTX) the jets to hybridize for 30% efficiency improvement through E Hybrid Jets. It’s pretty impressive. They’re the leading Hybrid developer and all the R&D costs are on UTX now a subsidiary of Raytheon.   BDRBF finally has a clean balance sheet, growing revenue, contractual demand, and is supported by the Canadian government. It’s in a “can’t lose” position to make massive gains, and I think it’s going to be a big play.  As of right now it’s trading at $0.505 and has made big leaps with the change in its CEO last year, the sale of its transpo, and the boost by CAN govt. I think they’re bound to be a big player. Their market cap is a reasonable 1.2B for a top global plane maker, that’s tiny. So I could see a 5-7B market cap if the sale of the tested and proven X plane actually takes off and the tech gets sold to competitors looking to not dump as much into failed R&D like GE did. That will easily place it above 5$ making it a 10x play.   I’m of course never selling my dip bought GME, Fuck CNBC, Fuck Melvin  So, as required 💎🤚  🚀🦍 🌝  👌👈🏳️‍🌈🐻|2021-02-02 08:55:58

Talking bad makes them feel better, so they’re not alone.  It’s sad. This is a fight against hedge funds. Regardless of your situation or your fundamental opinions on GME, you need to be cheering for GME. Why would you rather see GME crash and burn and let the hedge funds, and the stock market that YOU invest in be corrupt?  I’m not gonna lie, I cashed out some and I’m now playing on 100% “house money”.

lpvno5|lat43j|lat43j|3|Just a note to say that TD Ameritrade has restrictions on AMC and maybe (probably?) GME too.   At least they did yesterday (Mon 2/1/21)  Could not buy through the TOS platform program.   Called CS for another reason and mentioned and was told I must call in to a brokers desk.   Broker confirmed on AMC did not directly answer me on GME.  FYI that's at least a 60 if not 90 mins wait for CS to pick up the phone (every time) and then THEY transfer you to a broker - so let's call that another 10 or 15 mins.  So approx 75min to 2 hrs to make a buy.  I wonder what other brokers are doing this while still not calling the stocks "restricted"?   Because afaik TD is not calling GME or AMC restricted.  But I think 2 hours of phone time to make a buy is pretty dang restrictive.  Make of it what you will but this smooth brained life form thinks that somewhat explains the low volumes.     but wth do I know..?|2021-02-02 05:22:01

Overall I am down an estimated minimum of $12K (lost $1500 just yesterday being disallowed from selling AMC covered calls). On the high end of my estimate I may have lost as much as $16k.  Before some dingus "but actuallys" me, yes I know I can "call a broker" and place CCs by phone, but wait times are over 4 hours. Trust me, I sat on hold.

lq84bu|lat43j|lat43j|3|I need help understanding the short interest concept. Just trying to understand the various financial concepts - I'm new to investing. I am not a gay bear. I actually held positions in GME from ~35 to ~ 250. I didn't have a lot of shares (~30), I am just starting with limited capital.  Let's say for simplicity sake that 100 shares of GME are owned by 100 shareholders. Now the shorts borrow all 100 shares and sell it in the market again which is purchased by 100 new shareholders. Essentially, two shareholders are now sharing one "real" stock. Based on the actual number of shares released by the company, the short interest would be 100%.  But would this matter when the shorts are trying to cover? It seems to me like what would matter is the actual number of shares that have been sold and are available in the market held by all shareholders (200 shares). The ratio of shorted shares to the total number of shares in the market is 100/200 = 50%. This is still a high short interest I guess, but is it that difficult to cover?|2021-02-02 07:40:22

We will however keep you informed as and when this situation changes.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME nor AMC will appear in search. Please check the email we are sending out to all Revolut Trading Ltd customers for additional information about this situation.  Capital at risk.

lqprte|lat43j|lat43j|3|Trading Update for GME and AMC Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  While we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause, this is not a decision Revolut has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the stocks they make available. We will however keep you informed as and when this situation changes.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME nor AMC will appear in search. Please check the email we are sending out to all Revolut Trading Ltd customers for additional information about this situation.  Capital at risk.

lq0jck|lat43j|lat43j|9|Hi I want to talk more about this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions\_in\_gme\_calls\_bought\_today\_at\_800\_hold/glpsgxb/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/glpsgxb/?context=3)  Again I'm a monkey and have no clue what I'm doing. I'm also a stock trading noob.  If the hedges have spent the $ to make calls that GME will hit $800, hoping to make bank when it does, shouldn't we all set limit orders to sell at $799?  If we use a conditional order that's not visible to the market, right? So we set the condition that if GME hits $600 or $700, to place the limit order to sell at $799. Then when the short squeeze happens, all the sudden all these limit orders come out of nowhere.  This prevents the hedges from farming market data to see how many might be doing this, and we all keep saying we're holding until the price hits the moon.  If enough $799 orders are placed, it could prevent the squeeze from hitting $800 and the hedges would lose the gambles they made on all those $800 calls.  We walk away with our tendies, and the hedges lose everything.  Do you think it would work?|2021-02-02 06:24:24

lq3tx4|lat43j|lat43j|15|I have a feeling we may be on the precipice of the squeeze being squozen. I am new to markets so this shouldn't be considered financial advice in any way. This is pure speculation and I'm aware I could be very wrong  TLDR They are running out of bananas. Either they come to buy, or they try to sell us painted rocks  Here me out here. 3 days now we have been hit with Short Ladder Attacks and info attacks.  **Thursday:** They hit us hard with their first attack, and it was a big one. We were expecting ***something*** to happen but we weren't quite prepped for the scale. We fought back but werent entirely able to fend off. Still, they were spooked by how well we still managed to bounce back.  **Friday:** saw us locked out of the market on many platforms with fewer and fewer users able to buy stocks as the restrictions got tighter. They were worried and trying to freeze us out of buying  as they attempted another ladder attack. Fortunately we'd had time to prepare, found ways back in and continued to buy up with a massive buy in the closing minutes to push us over $320 and gave us hope.  **The weekend:** Now, just because the market was closed, does not mean things were quiet. News outlets attempted to convince us to sell, or buy silver to line Citadel's pockets for the coming squeeze. Reddit returned fire with billboards aplenty, keeping morale high and making it clear, our hands were still diamond.  **Monday** today's market was once again more of the same. Users still frozen out of the market (though some leeway given on some platforms). We bought the dips as best we could, though with such low volume it was difficult to buy our way back up to the high 300s.  Heres what I am thinking:  The hedge funds want the price as low as possible right? So why would they they attempt a ladder attack with such low volume when people were already frozen out of the market?  I think they're low on stock.  A big trade between themselves like on Thursday could have seen the price plummet to $100 or even lower, and with many users locked out of buying, particularly in large amounts, it would have been extremely difficult to climb back to $300.  Trading at low volume and trying to convince WSB to sell after all their manipulation did get the price lower, but we also had moments of growth, however sometimes candles didn't move much at all.  If they had the stock to drop the price like Thursday, or even friday, they would have done so.  This leads me to 2 conclusions. Either they are indeed low on stocks (because you glorious retards keep buying them up whenever theyre on  market) or we will see even further levels of stupidity as they attempt to short again, either way their grave is dug.  Now of course this all relies on the assumption their own supplies are low, and they dont have it in them for a war of attrition. I am pretty much basing this on the difference between Thurs and Mon markets and my observations while markets were open. Im aware I may have missed something that completely disproves this.  TLDR again They are running out of bananas. Either they come to buy, or they try to sell us painted rocks  (ROCKET TAX)|2021-02-02 07:00:19

You are or may feel a unique shame. Trading does that because there's a strong undertone of "you knew the risk" and "free market".  If you traded on margin you're feeling confused. It was so easy to do and now the losses may feel incomprehensible. It is confusing and you're not stupid.  It is unlikely that any crime was committed against you. If one was those responsible may face jail or fines paid to the government. You will not be repaid.  There may be a class action lawsuit. If by some remote chance you are part of a class with demonstrable damages and win, you will get cents on the dollar and it will take years.  These politicians are not going to help you. When most of them say why can institutions do this but not regular people they mean they want to regulate institutions, not help you.  Because of the publicity of all this congress will hold its hearings and people will be dressed down. But you will not be repaid.  My DMs are open and I will try to be as helpful as I can. Or just to listen.  If you have a question about a situation you're in with a trade, margin, etc it's probably best to post it here and let everyone help.  Take care of one another and yourself. You will make it through to the other side if you rely on others to help.|2021-02-02 08:07:12

lq5ehb|lat43j|lat43j|11|TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  They drive it as low as possible, hence enticing more people to buy low, meaning they make more gains as they will bet for it to go up.  Melvin has to do this. You are plain dumb if you think they only work with gme. They need to make this money back to cover themselves as a company as a whole, not just gme loss. They had to take money for other investments to cover gme loss, so need to make money for other bets as well!!  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover  not financial advice.|2021-02-02 07:15:46

But imagine even greater satisfaction after years to come that you proved your nerves to be rock hard when the prices went down even to 15$ and then rise up to na amount I can’t even guess. Imagine the excited eyes of your grandchilndren listening to old grandpa „steelballs” telling again the story of an army of men who proved to have the strongest nerves in whole humankind history. It’s like 300 Spartans defending against hundrets of thousends of Persians but this time the odds remain on our side and we shall prevail! Fear no dips brothers for I say to you.

Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them!

Stand up, look in the mirror, and realize that absolutely *no one* except the person you are looking at finds what you have to say insightful, intelligent, or even particularly interesting.

lq69fj|lat43j|lat43j|17|Storytime for the noobs:  Last summer, NASDAQ and S&P were recovering after the COVID crash and nearing their all-time highs.  NASDAQ, out of nowhere, blasted past its all-time high and... kept going. Tech was going insane. Just up, up, up, nonstop. The pandemic was in full-swing, unemployment was through the roof, and tech (and only tech) was going bananas. The S&P reversed as expected, but tech just mooned.  Some people said "wtf? this isn't right" and shorted QQQ. Other people said "fuck ya" and went long on QQQ.  What happened? Shit just kept going up. Longs got rich, shorts got fucked.  A few months later, it turned out that a japanese firm called Softbank was buying mass amounts of calls on specific tech companies to engineer a gamma squeeze. You might hear this referred to in the history books as the "NASDAQ whale."  What's the moral of this story? **It's better to be profitable than to be right.**  The bears were 100% right. There was no logical explanation for the rally, tech was super overvalued, and it should've gone down. But, it doesn't matter that they were right. A japanese company was forcing a gamma squeeze, and they got fucked.  I think about this when I see all of you guys talking about GME manipulation. You might be right. *But it doesn't matter.* When you bet on a stock or an ETF or an industry, you are betting on all the factors - the fundamentals, the manipulation, the powerful interests, the news cycle, the randomness, *everything.*  And when you bet against manipulators, you can't act like you got screwed when they, you know, manipulate. "Winning" in the market isn't about being fair, it's about being clever. And if you think you know that some assholes are gonna manipulate GME, you bet on it. You don't bet against it. That's how you win.  I feel like some of you newer traders are approaching the market incorrectly, and looking at it all wrong. Being right has no value. Money has value.  Just something to think about.  edit: inb4 too long i cant fucking read|2021-02-02 07:23:50

lq8dxc|lat43j|lat43j|6| This was removed as a post. IDK why  No DD. No sleep. That said, I have seen quite a few good posts illustrating this point. GME could easily be valued more than $128 a share in the long term. Chewy has a market cap of 41 B while GameStop is 15 B. Yeah right. Gamers spend big $ and in big #s. If GameStop can successfully transition to an online platform (which should be ez with Chewy CEO), then all previous valuations as a brick and mortar store are void. Also, breaking into the E-Sports scene would be easily conceivable and a huge opportunity for upside. We aren't talking an E-Sports team. We're talking a LEAGUE. Imagine being able to invest in the NFL in it's infancy. ALSO, games should pay big $ to have their games played/previewed if GameStop pulls this off. All of these changes, if profitable, would allow GameStop to cut product prices to very competitive levels too.  IDK why the company won't just make an announcement and raise capital with their new stock price. They could pull a Netflix  TLDR: The stock looks yummy at $130 even as a boomer long-term purchase and forgetting about any short squeeze.

lq10w1|lat43j|lat43j|13|**TLDR: Wall Street and Mevin drive the price as low as possible so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedgefunds have to make bets at the start of  the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses.

They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.   Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.|2021-02-02 06:30:10

lq9eqp|lat43j|lat43j|8|First of all: I like the stock and im very proud of my fellow 💎✋ note: I'm German so please excuse my english!  I have a genuine question and it might be just as retarded as I am but:   Correct me if I'm wrong but as we see in the VW short squeeze the "actual squeeze Event" was forced by Porsche buying almost 44 % of the remaining 45% shares of the actual VW float creating a very low float for demand! They also announced that on a Sunday so the HF didn't have any time to react and panicked on Monday morning creating a mass chaos on the market!   Doesn't that mean that the "actual GME squeeze" needs a "Event" so that the squeeze actually happens? I mean otherwise these HF could just buy back most of the shares over time while reducing the price of the shares by gradually "short attacking" the stock? This will be very hard to defend bc of the bs restrictions on RH etc.   We need to find a way to trigger those fucks - maybe in a sneaky way...  again this is no financial advise and I actually have no idea what im talking about so I'm just holding my 15 shares (avg. 200 EUR)   See you at the moon fellow retards! 🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-02 07:51:24

lq27qw|lat43j|lat43j|12|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover|2021-02-02 06:43:25

lpx4ga|lat43j|lat43j|16| A COMPLETE explanation of EVERYTHING. This sums up everything. SHARE. LIKE.     What is short selling:     Shorting, or short-selling, is when an investor, (hedge fund) borrows shares (from a broker), and immediately sells them, hoping he or she can scoop them up later, (buy them back), at a lower price.     In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock (borrowing from a broker Like Robin hood etc.) or other asset that the investor (hedge fund manager) believes will decrease in value by a set future date—>the expiration date. The investor (hedge fund manager) then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay the market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting that the price will continue to decline and they can purchase them at a lower cost.     Brokers (Robinhood, Webull, etc) get paid interest on those shares they lent to the investor (hedge funds) for the duration the investor holds those borrowed funds. The lender (broker > RH or Webull etc.) can request that the investor (hedge fund) return the shares whenever they want. They will typically do this when they see a massive spike in the share price. They can ask the investor (hedge fund) to return the shares at any time, whether it is a loss, or a gain for them. The investor (hedge fund) can continue to "double down" and borrow shares, provided the broker (RH etc) allows them to. They are typically pal's and work together behind the scenes (hence share purchase restrictions....and why you need to avoid these platforms.)     What happens if the price goes down:     If the price goes down below the price set at the expiration date, the Hedge Fund will make profits by the difference. Ex: Friday was $8.63. If the price closed at $1.63 on Friday, the hedge fund would have made a profit of $7/share that they shorted. This is why you see hedge funds act on negative news, or create negative news, to drive share prices down - so they profit. This is what WE are sick and tired of.     If the price goes up:     If the price goes up, the lender (Broker / RH etc) can ask the investor (hedge fund) to return the shares at a loss. The investor (hedge fund) will have to pay the lender the difference in price between the shorted price and the current market price. Example: Friday closed at $13.26. Expiration price was $8.63. The investor (hedge fund) could either buy as much as they can now and return the shares at the difference (loss) of $4.63 per share, or they can continue to short - provided the lender has not requested they return the borrowed shares. This is where the waiting game comes in. They may not want to pay that loss if they feel they can continue to short and believe they can manipulate the price down - this is where their scare tactics and selling pressure come into play.     Remember - you (we) own the shares they need to desperately buy. If they scare you into selling, this gives them the opportunity to buy your shares at a much lower price than what they would have to if we hold them and refuse to sell them at that lower price they've manipulated it through.     How do hedge funds manipulate share prices or apply selling pressure: (watch the video to understand)     VIDEO: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4)     Warning, watching this video may infuriate you even more as you see how these guys manipulate to take the average Joe's money.     \- they make the "impression" the stock is down and instill fear.... fear of losing your hard earned money. This will make you sell (they win).     So what do we do:     \- buy.   \- hold.   \- buy more.     What will the share price jump to?     Nobody can determine this or know this. Stop asking. What is the potential? The potential is indefinite, technically speaking. Technically, their exposure is indefinite but unlikely.   Will we see $20, $40, $60, $100, $200, $300, $500 ?   The quick answer is yes - that is possible. What does it depend on? It depends on us buying the shares, owning the shares, and holding the shares. If you sell them at $15, then they will buy them and that will be the price of the share. If you hold, and nobody sells until $100, then the price of the share will be $100. If everyone HOLDS and refuses to sell until $200, the price will then be $200 as someone agrees to sell for $300.     This is why it's important to hold. Buy, and hold. Do not sell.     How long will this take:   Options are expiring next week again. As options expire, hedge fund investors have increased pressure to buy back shares (cover). When they buy back shares, this creates an ongoing never ending effect of the price going up. The more the price goes up, the more pressure they get to buy back quicker, on and on. Keep in mind - the longer this goes on, the more interest they are paying on those shares. They will eventually crack and have to pay through the nose. I hope this helps everyone.|2021-02-02 05:41:50

lq5dkz|lat43j|lat43j|5|Hate to say it, but Robinhood and the other bitch platforms that restricted $GME buys may well end up saving Melvin and the hedgies.   Without the GME buying restrictions from RH and others over the last week, the short ladders could have been countered. But at the most crucial moment, the longs were handcuffed. Big buyers could keep going, but the legion small-time investors whose viral energy was necessary to boost the stock were kneecapped ... at just the wrong moment.  Robinhood and the other asshole brokers/platforms knifed the rocket's gas tank. Not enough fuel to get to the moon. They're hoping that by the time the rocket fuel tank is fixed, fear and boredom will have set in, and the energy dissipated.  I don't think it's necessarily over. But if it is, we know who to blame.|2021-02-02 07:15:32

lq1xme|lat43j|lat43j|7|   **TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedgefunds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands.

lpy57d|lat43j|lat43j|23|Downside lines are 150, 120, then 65 for GME. Look for bounces at those, if they don't hold it falls to the next level.  Hopefully it moons again, but if you're bagholding now, it's looking like it's more likely that it will get worse.   If you're bagholding since the 400s. Sorry dude, but if you don't get a bounce here you will probably never see that price again.  Good luck yall. And fuck the hivemind retards that downvote anything negative about GME. Yall are doing more damage to the average bro than the hedge funds ever did.|2021-02-02 05:55:04

CNBC already confirmed that one of mods on Wall Street Silver retired from a HF. They're promoting false news and paying media people to spread these lies. Some of us witness it yesterday February 1 2021. I won't be surprised if they're telling their own people to buy silver then sell it and then they short it, to make profit both ways! I'm not financial advisor but it look like inside trading. It all smoke and mirrors, so they can keep shorting GME, AMC & etc.....SO HOLD GME and AMC!|2021-02-02 06:31:13

lqoxxl|lat43j|lat43j|2|Since my post got deleted, I suppose I should post this here...  I had my RH account transferred to fidelity.

The transfer of account is still listed as pending, but part of the transfer has this listed:  TRANSFER OF ASSETS DEBIT CASH BALANCE PENDING REVIEW (Margin)  📷**Amount**\-$4,500.00  I had a $0 cash balance in RH, and what little I did invest was all covered by a bank transfer. I know there's a $75 fee, which I see as a separate transfer. Is this just some kind of random temp hold thing Fidelity/RH do while a transfer is happening, or is RH trying to fuck people transferring?|2021-02-02 09:35:34

lq2e5i|lat43j|lat43j|6|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us.

lpxbvn|lat43j|lat43j|8|So far it has been a year since I opened a RH account and it has been a fucking disaster. Down 16%. I have so much to live for but man this is depressing. A week ago I had 5k in my account, it rocketed to 13k and now down to 4K. I let my family down so much because of this. What is worse is that now my account depends on BB 25 2/29 and GME. Not worried about PLTR 38 5/21 but the rest? Uh. This money was part of my downpaymenr for a house. Still on track to have money to close but losing this much money makes me sick. I am a fucking idiot  edit: things took a turn for the worse. down 60%|2021-02-02 05:44:34

lq2hgj|lat43j|lat43j|7|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover|2021-02-02 06:46:22

I am not sure I want to be part of stocks anymore.  What does that tell us?  It's all a scheme guys.  It's not fair with just the market demand/supply, these hedge funds are destroying the stocks with attacks on certain companies.  They are trying to make literally thousands of people lose jobs with their attacks.  We can't win this war.  It's a Fing scheme.

Ok that’s the least subtle reincarnation of Q a disinformation writer could come up with.   The conspiracies to get people hooked? Check.   The actual absence of theoretical hostile foreign investors who would have much to gain from watching both young yolo’ers hold the bag and/or their parents’ retirement funds crater alongside the US economy tanking? Check.  The acronyms, emoji spam, “code language”, and insider terms to refer to each other as a way to signify membership (aka retards)? Check. You’re the new pedes, grats.  It’s the same post over and over with tons of reinforced comments about not believing the news, investing and holding no matter what, and demonizing anyone or anything that says the opposite. It’s the same “high energy” shit you saw at TD in it’s heyday.  Watch the tone, the demands, and the emotional appeals. Please don’t get swept up in Q 2.0.

Buy for freedom and because they’re trying cheat the system with restrictions and limiting buying, Wall Street  only caused a sell off making the little guy only sell or get burnt, while hedge funds get to play by different rules. Saying time for the little guy to sit out. Burn the dirty hedge funds betting against us to the ground or at least bankrupt them. We need everyone’s help, this is a war. We will win... AMC will be going parabolic but keep holding because Diamond 💎 Hands. PT $250+ The longer we hold, the more hedges have to cover huge. Making the sky the limit..

lpx4hf|lat43j|lat43j|5|What is the current situations on AMC? Can some 🦧 do some DD and inform us 🦍s?  Looking at marketwatch, 79% if float is shorted.  It says short interest is 44,671,962. What does this mean?  The volume yesterday was lower than for the last 7 days (434 million) but a magnitude higher than GME volume (37 million). What does this project?  It says public float is 56 million but volume yesterday is 434 million. Does this mean that there was a lot of buying and selling going on, ie on average a share changed hands 8 times yesterday?  Where can I check short interests on AMC shorts?  Thanks guys! Let's 🚀🌕|2021-02-02 05:41:51

lq6tmj|lat43j|lat43j|3|   Hello fellow apes.  I have had a thought linger in the back of my mind for a while and I need someone help sort my bananas so I can make sense of this or whether a chimp is actually ready to take my potasium boost snack out from under me.  Say this chimp owes the zoo 100 bananas. Us proper apes have 99 of all the bananas and the chimp has only 1 banana left. Chimp's about to be in a lot of trouble, right? But what if that chimp had the following idea: a deal struck with the zoo.  The chimp takes his banana and offers it back to the zoo. They both agree that the chimp now only owes the zoo 99 more bananas. Then the chimp asks the zoo to sell him back that same banana for a few pebbles - as opposed to the seventeen rocks the apes want for their share of the bananas. The zoo, seeing how this could cause a whole lot of trouble for all the animals there, decides he will sell that one banana for a few pebbles. The chimp then gives that banana back to the zoo as well, leaving him only 98 bananas in debt.  These two primates repeat this action until the chimp no longer owes the zoo any bananas and is only down 100 handfuls of pebbles instead of 1700 granite rocks. The zoo knows he could've gotten a lotta rocks if he waited, but instead chose to help out the chimp because he feared the larger ramifications and happens to be on friendly terms with the chimp.  What is stopping them from doing this?|2021-02-02 07:28:58

This has caused a significant increase in trading volumes and demands on our platform. As a result of this some clients have experienced disruption to service. This has fallen short of the high standards we set ourselves and the service you deserve. For those clients who have experienced disruption, I would like to offer you my sincere apologies, and assure you we are addressing these issues as a matter of urgency.     We took a number of steps immediately and continue to implement additional measures to avoid any further disruption:     1.Our teams are working around the clock to improve the resilience, login and trading capacity of the platform2.We have significantly increased the number of support staff available to assist you, with 24-hour support available at [helpdesk.uk@ig.com](mailto:helpdesk.uk@ig.com). If you have emailed the helpdesk we will get back to you.3.We have temporarily paused new account opening so that we can focus on providing our existing clients with the service they deserve.  **We have also made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend new trading on GameStop and AMC Entertainment**. We fundamentally believe in empowering our clients and enabling them to trade what they want, when they want, how they want. This decision has been entirely motivated by our desire to ensure our platform and services remain fully operational for existing clients, as we prioritise giving you the best service we can.     We will continue to closely monitor this quickly evolving situation. We will bring in additional measures if necessary and seek to remove any trading restrictions as soon as possible.     I thank you for your patience.     **June Felix**   CEO, IG Group|2021-02-02 09:17:17

If you believed in this play a week ago but are no longer sure, ask yourself, what changed? We got punched in the mouth. The quick play became a slower play. As far as I can tell, that's about it.

lq355q|lat43j|lat43j|6|   **TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover  not financial advice.|2021-02-02 06:53:20

lpzhug|lat43j|lat43j|9|If you're an inexperienced trader and you're repeating things you hear on reddit to try to get people to buy/hold GME, you've become the thing you swore to fight. People are mindlessly repeating things about short ladders, options sweeps, premarket volume, and they literally learned about these things an hour ago.   You're playing with other people's money, and trying to manipulate their decision making. That's what you claim to be against, yet you are actively doing the same thing.   If GME is going to the moon, you don't have to spam it. You don't have to convince people. It'll happen. If this thing goes tits up, and you were part of the brigade telling people not to sell, you should feel bad, because you fucked with other people's money. You pretended to be an expert, and people believed you. That's a shitty thing to do. Bottom line.  I've been on WSB for years, and I've never told anyone to buy, sell, or hold anything. And it's something I rarely saw until recently, and now it's every post. This is some nefarious shit, and you need to understand how much you can fuck up people's lives doing shit like this.|2021-02-02 06:11:56

On one hand you got the early people with very low averages that still have profits holding watching those profits shrink because they didn't get out in time hoping to get it back instead of taking what are still very good profits. Then on the other hand you got people that never had profits. Tried to catch the wave that turned into a water fall and are stuck with $300, $400 and some $500 averages. Smh.

lqn6rl|lat43j|lat43j|5|Losses suck. They are expensive but good lessons.   Take the experience and learn from it. You will make money in the markets long term if you stick with it and make good decisions. Speculation is a boom or bust game. Sometime it works great. Sometimes it’s a car wreck. Taking a massive gain doesn’t make you a rock star. Taking a massive loss doesn’t make you a loser. You only lose if the loss makes you never buy stocks again.   Think about the lessons here. How can you apply that to the future. You DFV play may never happen. But you can and will make money if you buy good stocks and hold them over the long term. But when you get a good gain you need to sell. 💎 🙌 can be your friend and they can be your downfall|2021-02-02 09:24:53

Think about it.  We buy $100-$1000 lots unleveraged (because RH and the lot restrict us) each on the dip, they come in and buy the dip with $1M (with leverage) at $200, ride the wave, price goes to 300-350, they sell, make a shit tonne of money, price drops, they buy again, rinse, repeat!

lq5ks4|lat43j|lat43j|3|TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  They drive it as low as possible, hence enticing more people to buy low, meaning they make more gains as they will bet for it to go up.  Melvin has to do this. You are plain dumb if you think they only work with gme. They need to make this money back to cover themselves as a company as a whole, not just gme loss. They had to take money for other investments to cover gme loss, so need to make money for other bets as well!!  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover  not financial advice.|2021-02-02 07:17:25

lpxfh5|lat43j|lat43j|3|For those of you asking about the Viking and where he went here’s a breakdown:  He said he was going in big time and on Friday we could see every time they tried to do a short ladder attack it was bought up at specific price points to drive the price back up. We closed above $320 which was a big deal since all of those calls now have to be bought by the end of today and many were giving him credit for this. Yesterday the short ladder attacks continued and there wasn’t enough buying to get the price back up and we’re still in the free fall. He then posted that he had bought in with everything he had and there was no more capital left from him and his Viking buddies. He also said that the chances of the short squeeze we’ve all been waiting for still happening aren’t looking good as the Melvin’s of the world appeared to have been able to buy back what they’ve owed at the lower prices which was helped exponentially by not letting people buy at the end of last week. He said he was still long though and not selling for what that’s worth. His latest move was to delete all of his posts, change his Twitter name/handle, and now has vowed to try and expose how unfair the market is for retail investors. FWIW I don’t know anything about his history as I’m a newb around here and am holding what I consider to be a substantial bag of GME although it pales in comparison to many here. When he popped back up a few days ago those that knew of him were talking about how his calls in the past had all come through and now that he’s saying the squeeze will most likely not be squoze is concerning to me.   Having said all that I’m still going to hold in the off chance that he’s wrong and we see some sort of miracle in the future. I’m only posting this since I’ve seen a few posts asking what happened to him and believe everyone should have access to all available information when $$$ is on the line. Hopefully I got this all mostly right and didn’t go full autist. Please be kind everyone, we are all on the same team in the end.  TL;dr: Viking gone, me hold still albeit with a heavy heart and even heavier bag.|2021-02-02 05:45:53

Jokes aside- if you’re at a point now where you can leave without going in on $ROPE, but fear you’re screwed if it goes lower, I’d personally call it quits. Always a chance that it goes back up ofc, and if it does and you’ve sold, accept that, but you really can’t put a price on your well-being.

lq9xrd|lat43j|lat43j|4|  Winning this war will not be measured on how many bullets we will have fired into GME or AMC stocks. It will be decided when the shooting stops. Who has the fortitude and the ammo to keep shooting. That’s who the victor will be. We have to want it more then them. Even when the ammo gets low. We will have to dig in and reach deep to hold this line.   These hedge funds have gone to war with the warring class. They’ve never even seen a war unless it was on TV! These are the same people that will tell us who we should be fighting. What we should be fighting for. But, not this time! This is our war and our fight. This is the moment we no longer fight for ways to make them rich! Or watch them from our battlefields, as they watch from the safety of their ivory towers!

lq2fwb|lat43j|lat43j|4|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost.

lq6psb|lat43j|lat43j|4|I am aboard the AMC Rocketship and I am ready to go to the MOON. I bought 145 shares yesterday and will probably get more later today. But I can't go full retard with all of my investments. I also have MJNA, TRGP, TGODF, T, LUMN, and one share of MCD because I thought it would sound cool to earn a fractional percentage of every french fry sold. I know... I am a stupid ape. I got caught up in dividend investing youtube videos and drank the kool aid. I was too late to the GME party. It is incredibly exciting to see all of these new people who are taking it to these hedge funds and winning the war. You don't need to win every battle to win the war. I wonder what other stocks that they are overly short on. I would love to attack their portfolios on more than one front. The faster they bleed across the board the faster the squeeze we are all hoping for actually happens. I am not a financial advisor this is just something I had been thinking about. I am just another ape turned astronaut that is strapped into a rocketship hoping to land on the moon.  Apes stronger together.|2021-02-02 07:28:00

lq2ct4|lat43j|lat43j|2|**TLDR: Wall Street and Melvin drive the price as low as possible to allow more people to buy, so when they make their next bet in the next few days, they can bet it rises to the thousands. Hedge funds have to make bets at the start of the month. They will aid us on it going to the moon.**  So we all know that Melvin and his cronies had a hedge fund 'bet' placed at GME finishing this month at 6USD value. They then cut their losses at 400USD. This means they need to do this even more! In the next few days, they are going to have to sell their 'bet' and start over. This is why they are frantically trying to drive the price as low as possible, so they cut with minimal losses. Once this happens, here is what will follow:  Melvin and all the other assholes are going to bet GME to go long. You heard me. They drive it as low as possible for their next bet, then bet that it rises. They should, if they have any brains, help drive GME up. They will get RH and others to remove buy limits. They will get CNBC to stop shitting all over us. They will make back their losses, and gain more.  They make billions, we make hundreds and thousands. They will want GME to go to the thousands. They are playing us. They want it to go as low as possible so that they can make as much money as possible when it goes to the thousands.  Let them play us. They will invest in it going up, because once, in the next few days, they bet it goes up, they NEED it to go to the thousands. Repost if you see this.\]  They cut it as low as possible in a few days, then bet it skyrockets, and make back and more what they lost. Only way they can not go bankrupt, as they also have bets on other stocks they can now no longer cover|2021-02-02 06:44:57

We have just received notification, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, will not be able to offer Buys on GameStop ($GME), AMC Entertainment ($AMC) and Nokia ($NOK) due to increased capital requirements set by the DTC.  Any buy orders on any of these symbols made after Monday’s close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open Tuesday.  To be clear, this is not a decision Stake has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the securities they make available. As such, we are unable to confirm when this may change.

lqi7xp|lat43j|lat43j|2|From a fundamental prospective there is no way retail traders win this war. The problem is too many disparate decision makers. A hedge fund aggregates money from disparate sources and trades as a single point of contact with as much force as needed. Retail traders can not aggregate the decision to the same effect. As a result, the greed of an individual will cause the collapse of the price support that a single decision point can guarantee.   Not investment advise, but a leader in the forum could effect the same capability of the hedge fund single point of contact and effectively magnify the resulting purchase. That is the ONLY way to beat the institutions.   The other problem is this is not investing, this is speculating and you should never put more than 10% of your money in speculative stock moves.   I am a retail investor that was robbed. Wall street robbed me of millions after my company went public. Hedge funds illegally shorted the stock before the lockup period ended and before options were even available.   What you all are doing is admirable but it needs better coordination and the ability to spring a trap on the hedges like that have with you!|2021-02-02 08:54:24

While we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause, this is not a decision Revolut has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the stocks they make available. We will however keep you informed as and when this situation changes.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME nor AMC will appear in search. Please check the email we are sending out to all Revolut Trading Ltd customers for additional information about this situation.  Capital at risk. Share prices can go up as well as down and you may get back less than what you initially paid.|2021-02-02 08:35:38

lq4osc|lat43j|lat43j|2|It’s obvious that the restrictions lowered the actual volume able to enter these trades. That would mean everyone will need multiple account with different brokers to attempt to capture the share count needed to move it. Plus A lot of people jumped out of Robinhood and are waiting for their funds to transfer. How many days will that take?   This is there sport. And new traders can’t see this is what’s happening. Which in turn causes them to give up their hands. GME shorts now are at 88% short float. They are covering their shorts. But the ones that really hold this will give time for everyone to allow their funds to transfer into their new brokerage.|2021-02-02 07:08:51

lq9s2l|lat43j|lat43j|2|One person asks a legitimate question and gets terrible flawed answers back and it just goes on as being fact from there.  The premise outlined was a stock gets shorted from, say 100 to 10 “artificially” by hedge funds. If all the holders keep holding, the hedge funds need to cover eventually, so the hedge funds end up needing to buy the shares back at even higher prices than they shorted it. If the hedge funds don’t buy it back, they bleed money every day based on the borrow rate for the shares they sold short.  Sure, seems vaguely valid at first glance. Except, that’s not how borrow fees work.   On a hard to borrow security, your borrow fee may be 100%. So let’s say I short a share at $100 on a 100% borrow rate and the companies share close at $100 every day for the next year. In that case, yes, I would have paid $100 in borrow fees and I’d still have to cover the short by buying back the share for another $100.  However, if I short at $100/sh, then the price dumps to $10/sh, my 100% borrow fee is based on the $10/sh price. So if I don’t cover for a year as the stock keeps closing at $10/sh, then I’d end up paying $10/sh in borrow fees and would still need to buy the share to cover at another $10. But guess what? That still leaves me with $80 profit. There is not rush to cover. That entire premise is overlooked in this terrible reddit advice|2021-02-02 07:54:29

lqq4n0|lat43j|lat43j|1|More from CNN today, Tuesday, Feb 2 2021 on the negative feedback loop for the big wigs.  ### Negative feedback loop  Here's why: Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other Reddit-favored stocks were forced to take steps to counter their losses. Some faced margin calls, requests to put up more capital when positions weaken. To raise cash, they had to sell completely unrelated but highly liquid stocks such as Apple ([AAPL](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&source=story_quote_link)) and Amazon ([AMZN](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&source=story_quote_link)). And that in turn caused other investors to take chips off the table, continuing the negative feedback loop.  ### [https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/02/investing/wall-street-reddit-gamestop-hedge-funds/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/02/investing/wall-street-reddit-gamestop-hedge-funds/index.html)|2021-02-02 09:42:29

lq8edb|lat43j|lat43j|-4|I think this event will wipe more people out of WSB than the 2020 march event did tbh because now there are so many new and inexperienced people 😞  I know that you all believe that it’ll go back up, and half of me thinks it will too. But the other half of me says it won’t and if it doesn’t it’ll hurt a lot of people.  We’ve all said only put in what you can afford to lose but not everyone has followed that.  The other thing is that volume may be low but people are selling. For every poster on wsb holding, there is likely another person selling.   Yes DFV is still in it. We don’t know how much of his conviction has to do with the stock’s short interest and how much is due to long term growth potential. Until he says something I would take the long term option and save my money.  I sold my shares in premarket today. When it dips lower i’ll buy back in bit but for now, i’m out.   i’m hoping for all of you to make money. but the behaviour in this sub has become very cultish and aggressive towards viewpoints that suggest gme might be done.  i know i’ll be downvoted but you should be considering both sides. you’re playing against hedge funds who are able to blatantly manipulate the market and scare people into selling. if you’re not selling someone else might be. and the funds can take a loss.  good luck guys!|2021-02-02 07:42:46

I knew this day would come, I just didn't think 5 million noobie traders who opened brokerage accounts yesterday would be the ones taking the worst of it. Like an actual ponzi scheme.

These companies are going under, they don’t make any money.  A discount is if these stocks are at $2 not $100.  What’s worse are all these people holding the bag at $350+ with their life savings cuz they came in late and read all the BS that was being spewed on here pumping up the damn thing.

lqfj03|lat43j|lat43j|1|**OXY 30c 2/19 , 3/19 split 50/50**  Oil being worthless in a decade is all fantasy.  We could be at war.  Nobody can predict such a demise in global usage.    I love TSLA and all clean* energy, but reality is way different than what people have in their minds right now.  At least in terms of dollars, all these stocks and their future earnings are being discounted way too much. The OXY calls are still great entry here. Nobody's talking about the coming energy squeeze and option prices are not being bid up yet. But the realization from the bottoms may happen in a matter of days, such as the other squeezes in pockets around the market, that way it locks the majority out from the big gains.. Healthy bottoming process.  This is the one place still available for those 50-100x gains. I’m already in the 2/19 and 3/19 30c. NOT a high short interest equity, just a bottoming trade.   I'm in @ .15 and .54 respectively|2021-02-02 08:38:18

lq77q8|lat43j|lat43j|-7|Anyone who made a loss on this stock can treat it as a learning experience. 90% of traders lose money.  Threatening the guy who sold his 1 share for a profit is ridiculous, as if that 1 share could move a stock by 1c.  The price is moving lower because there is more supply than demand - that's it. That's how stock pricing works. Everyone who wanted the stock has bought and has either sold for a profit or is holding waiting for new buyers which don't exist at this price point (maybe they do at a lower price).  What is driving DOWN the price is that people, funds and banks can play options and realise that there no sense in this stock being at $400 so they are making a mint off of a short sell from that price point even whilst the remaining desperate holders try and find new buyers.  If you bought the stock at $20 and think Gamestop is a great investment regardless of what the fundamentals and trends say, great, hold it.  If you bought the stock as a get quick rich in 30 days scheme at $400, I'm afraid you've lost your gamble, lesson learned.  I do not own GME, nor have I ever. Whilst I have rooted for you all to do well, this is now reaching an inevitable conclusion. If the stock is "a Bargain at $150" - it would be over $150 now.

lqib2e|lat43j|lat43j|-4|Here's a little thought exercise for you retards.  You guys have a class where the teacher always curves up the score on the test so the person who did the best gets a 100 and everyone else moves up in conjunction. So if the best score was a 95 and you got an 82, you get curved up to an 87.   Now imagine, the biggest retard in your class says "If we all band together and agree to get a zero, we will all get a 100%!" But the test is a takehome. So you have no way of knowing if people will follow through.   Do you risk taking the zero and trust your classmates? If your answer is no, then maybe you can put 2 and 2 together on why trusting anonymous retards to have diamond hands is the stupidest shit I've ever seen.|2021-02-02 08:54:56

They just seem like a good stock so I bought them but now I am confused Nokia is the pretty solid company so I don't understand all the pushback on some brokerages blocking the buying of the stock?

It  actually has the fundamentals and value to be a good bet. There are so  many other DD's on it already so I'll just give 2 updates: They hit 100  contracts for 5g which is huge in the competitive 5G market and Ericsson  had great earnings due to their 5G performance. It's on a dip right now  so you can scoop up some cheap shares and contracts for the report on  thursday the 4th. If you're in already because of the hype of last week  staying in isn't a bad idea IMO.  Full disclosure: I own NOK options and shares. This is not financial advice.|2021-02-02 09:53:34

lqqnua|lat43j|lat43j|-4|Fellow monkeys, apes, retards, diamond hands, and Tendiemen. Multiple hedge funds are shorting the stock SNDL$. We need to fix this, like we united together for AMC$ and GME$, we need to do the same for SNDL$. I want to see pictures of only AMC, GME, and SNDL in your accounts. Of course, do your own DD, and this is not investment advice. Edit:Also, SNDL$ has to stay above 1$ for 10 consecutive days to still be listed on the NASDAQ, so let’s keep that up. And, today SNDL$ is between $1.00-$1.25, which is the perfect time to buy buy buy. Edit 2:Sorry for all these edits lol, I promise this is the last one. As for DD (For noobs, this means do your own research). Congress is set to federally legalize cannabis/marijuana. Now, if you dig into SNDL a little bit more, you will see they are located in Canada, but I believe when cannabis/marijuana is legal in USA federally, they will expand over here. They also put in 100Million dollars into their stock, which drove the price down about 20 cents. And for your questions, why not Canopy Growth Corp (CGP) or Green Thumb Industries (GTI). Well I believe that these are teenager stocks, and that SNDL is a baby stock. SNDL is just learning how to walk, and will soon explore the world and grow. Essentially, SNDL is new to the market, and is at a good price. While CGP$ and GTI$ have been around for awhile. For the second time, always do you own research and DD, and invest how you want, don’t listen to anybody. And, only invest what you can afford to lose.|2021-02-02 09:45:36

When a stock has run up 1600% in a week and begins to go down, you know, as stocks do. Do not catch the falling knife. You will fucking bleed every damn time. This is what you’re seeing. GME will be $60 before the week is over, maybe even lower. I am not a bot, I bought a 125 shares at $75 and sold at $350-400.  Don’t be fucking naive.

lqm7d2|lat43j|lat43j|0|If you are going to bet against a company that actually isn't doing well (Gamestop) you can pump up the price for a bit, but once those Hedge Funds close out their short positions (mostly) and your point has been made, Sell. Otherwise the market is going to level out and come back to reality, so Sell, take your profits, remember how much the hedge funds lost (and laugh). Then, move on to the next. Now, if the stock/company has a possibility of gaining value in the future you can Hold, but let's be honest, Gamestop (retail) isn't looking good.|2021-02-02 09:18:46

Those of us that have been around these parts a few years can see it clear as day.  Did we take down the hedge funds? NO  Did we cause them pain and massive losses? YES  But you do realize the hedgeys were loading shorts on GME above $300 right? What do you think those positions were for? They are making a lot of money right now. They saw this drop coming, as did the more seasoned users here.  I'm all for sticking it to the hedge fund fucks, but just want you new guys to realize you are going to get burned, hard.

lqlaye|lat43j|lat43j|-2|Some past squeezes that people keep comparing GameStop to:  Tesla - An energy company that makes EVs, have Elon, people genuinely see them as the future of vehicles. People BELIEVED in the company which leads to strong convictions and diamond hands.  Volkswagen- 90% of shares were owned by Porsche so no chance of retail investors ruining it for everyone.  GameStop- Dying blockbuster-esque company. Could be worth $100 in the future if Cohen turns it around but will it actually reach that price on fundamentals alone? Shares are owned by retail investors, classic prisoners dilemma at play here, lets face it- we are selfish and here to make money.  99% of us are in it for the squeeze and the squeeze requires strangers to hold together. **Can you seriously trust a stranger to hold onto to GME for the price to actually moon? Do you actually believe in the company enough to have conviction and diamond hands like the Tesla bulls?**  Just some food for thought.

News has always been sensationalist and it has always been inaccurate in one way or another. Always. Saying "fake news" betrays a basic misunderstanding of the nature of news. It will always have a spin.  There was an opportunity here. Things were great for a while, then brokerage issues took the wind from the sails. That SUCKED. Now the opportunity is passed and it's time to move on. This was never a moral crusade. It was a money-making opportunity.  Your five minutes reading copy-pasted reddit posts does not make you smarter investors than the people whose literal jobs are to play the stock market.|2021-02-02 09:14:04

Couldnt they essentially get 4 shares for the price of 1 and cover their previous shorts this way making our biggest desired demand dissapear?

It's not a GME it's not overnight. But it's a solid investment. Again not a financial advisor but if you're feeling sad there's numbers on this reddit, if you're angry it's against yourself and power to the players you know so don't hate the players hate the game.

Pro tip for the future, since 90% of you are about to get burned badly. Don’t take advice from fucking anonymous Reddit accounts. Go google for yourself. If this sub was telling you to hold a month ago I’d say you can listen to that (to an extent). But 6m new members means 6/7ths of you are idiots who just started trading.

lpxqqr|lat43j|lat43j|-33|Want to know how to invest?   Stay away from garbage like GME at $100+ ;cyber money in 2017 or recently at 50k.   Understand the fundamentals and be early on investing. GME a few weeks ago? Nice investment. Cyber money after the 2017 bubble? Nice investment. But how can people be that stupid and buy in at such prices? At the end of the day everyone wants to make money even the people posting that GME became a personal thing. They shoot you in the back and you are the one bagholding.   Understand the fundamentals of a company. For example TSLA imo is still a good buy because if you dive deep into their fundamentals they will be a money printing machine. Or take PLTR, BB.... all very likely to be printing machines. And you dogs buying GME at $400. Every lost penny 10000% deserved.|2021-02-02 05:49:59

Here it is.  The largest rallies happen in stock crashes. As this stock falls you will see massive rallies and your idiot brain will tell you that this is the return to $500 and beyond! You’ll get a bout of euphoria. This is very common. Don’t trust it, you are just a victim of confirmation bias. Use those rips to get out and save yourself from massive losses as other retards rush in to buy also convinced it’s a buying opportunity. Be the better retard and live to fight another day. And no I’m not a spam account hoping you lose money I have never owned or shorted a single share of any of these meme stocks, I’ve been here for several years and lived through many a disappointing trend where I lost much more than I should have.

Even though I lost a few hundred dollars, I have to laugh. Meme magic brought me in and meme magic is seeing me out.   You win or you learn. I know myself pretty well at this point — even if there’s a recovery later today, I would’ve been anxious about the GME share price all day. Given my personality, I couldn’t put myself through that. Maybe I’ll miss out on the MOASS and making that easy money I hoped for before Robinhood let us all down. I could also miss a dead cat bounce that would allow me to recover my principal. However, I decided it’s not worth putting myself through that emotional wringer.   Sorting comment threads by “controversial” for the first time last night was like jumping into freezing water, but it gave me the clarity I needed. In hindsight, once RH turned off the tap, it became a different game that I was not ready to play. I am thankful for the WSB old heads who helped me make the right decision for myself.   I wish all of you GME true believers the best. I hope you find what you’re looking for.  On the plus side, this whole GME saga has gotten me interested in investing for the first time. I’m thinking about sticking around and learning how to do this with a smarter process. I might reserve 5-10% of my future portfolio into this high risk meme stuff, it might be fun. Plus I’d like to recoup my losses, let’s be honest.   tl;dr: had fun getting caught up in the meme wave, realized this wasn’t for me, sold at a loss for $420, learned some valuable lessons,  might do more stonks in the future.|2021-02-02 09:31:38

lq5xd0|lat43j|lat43j|-6|You know, it's funny that of all the stocks WSB could rally behind, it chose GME. A company that regardless of everyone's efforts will eventually die out due to the transition of gaming going from physical to digital. The next generation of consoles will likely be selling more digital consoles than physical ones, and the generation after that might outright just not sell a console with a disc anymore, even though physical games benefit the consumer more by a landslide. On top of that, gamestop isn't exactly a nice company. Not in the U.S at least.  Then we have AMC. Kinda in the same boat as gamestop. The constant digitisation of our services would have forced them to close down eventually anyway. Just like blockbuster did. The more cinemas closed, the more likely it would have been that we could stream the newest blockbuster movie directly from home the day it came out, but people went and saved them from bankruptcy lol.  I'm glad the shorties got fucked, but considering who which companies benefited from this I also feel a bit conflicted.|2021-02-02 07:20:43

Please.   well, fu, real people are paying the price for that, literally and figuratively, financially and mentally.    Shame on you! Shame on you for driving good, hopeful people crazy.

lqgjym|lat43j|lat43j|-40|This is going to be a tough pill to swallow for a lot of you but GME is worth about $10/share. The hedge fund squeeze game is over. If you hold now expect another 90% loss after today.|2021-02-02 08:44:38
lpwd8f|lat43j|lat43j|-25|Say you were a hedge fund deep underwater with these shorts, what would you do?  What if you just closed your shorts causing a squeeze from 20-450 per share.  Then help create and join in with the hype of the reddit activist revolution against wallstreet to keep the price high. Take out some new shorts and then let it come crashing down to earth to recoup your losses.  Personally I think the game is over. 1500% up in a month and ya'll saying the squeeze still hasn't happened yet?  I'm out. Taking my 300% gains, gutted i didn't take em when I was up 700%, that's what greed does hey.   Good luck to you guys still holding.|2021-02-02 05:31:41

lqll7o|lat43j|lat43j|-3|Here is what Fidelity is pushing when I log in.     # GameStop slides, silver spree stalls as retail traders run out of road  By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Thyagaraju Adinarayan, Reuters - 42 minutes ago 				Top News       (Reuters)  -GameStop shares sank on Tuesday and a silver buying spree led by small  investors subsided as the Reddit-driven trading frenzy that has shocked  global financial markets over the past week started to show signs of  fizzling out.  The videogame chain's shares, which have see-sawed in a slugfest that  has seen billions of dollars gained and lost by hedge funds and other  financial investors, were down 42% at $130 in pre-market trading after scaling a high of $483 last week.  Spot silver prices, an alternative focus in the battle between a pack of small traders and Wall Street hedge funds, fell more than 5% after hitting an eight-year high a day earlier.  Analysts said the silver pullback may show the limits of small  investors' impact in a large market, while posts on the popular Reddit  forum, WallStreetBets, ranged from those giving up on the GameStop trade  to calls to stick with the stock.  "The stocks side of things has faded because they all had a look at  silver yesterday, but my feeling is they'll be back, depending on  whether retail trading platforms will allow you to buy more than one  share," said Keith Temperton, an equity sales trader at Forte Securities.  Another Reddit favorite, movie theater operator AMC, slumped 33%  although it remains 500% higher than the start of the year, before the  organized band of small buyers piled in and forced a "squeeze" that  required big funds to close short positions by buying shares at very  high prices.  Online broker Robinhood, on whose platform much of the buying and  selling has taken place, confirmed on Monday it had raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders following a $1 billion boost last week as it strives to meet demands for additional collateral to cover trades.  The broker has also held talks with banks about raising another $1 billion in debt, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Analysts at financial institutions continued to predict the action,  which has drawn the attention of regulators, politicians and  celebrities, was likely to fade, it was just a question of how soon.   "The hope factor of this stock is very big," said Chris Bailey, strategist at Raymond James.  "So over this year, does the share price continue to go down? The  answer is yes. We've seen it with internet shares in 2000 and so I think  it will happen again."  SHOWDOWN  In London,  a sign of still-strong demand came from online greeting-card retailer  Moonpig, which leapt 25% in its debut on Tuesday, while emerging markets  research house Tellimer pointed to Ping An Insurance and Tencent as  being ripe for a short squeeze in Asia.  Broader markets appeared to be moving on from the jitters the  frenzied buying has triggered, and S&P 500 futures rose 0.8% on  stimulus hopes. \[MKTS/GLOB\]  Tesla Inc billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, whose  candid tweets about certain companies helped send shares soaring last  month, said he was taking another break from Twitter.  The number of shorted GameStop shares has fallen by more than half in a week, analytics firm S3 Partners said on Monday, although the videogame retailer remained the sixth-biggest short by value.  "There certainly exists a frothiness to this market that we are  concerned about ... (but) we do think that this year has the potential  to be a solid one for equities," said Joseph Amato, chief investment officer of equities at Neuberger Berman.  "Unlike these option-fueled stocks, valuations in general are underpinned by improving fundamentals."  QUICKSILVER  One big drag on silver prices was an overnight margin hike on contracts for the metal by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which makes speculative trade using derivatives more expensive.  The U.S. iShares Silver Trust ETF, the largest silver-backed ETF,  fell 5% before the trading bell a day after posting its biggest one-day  gain in more than five months.   The ETF added about 20 million ounces of silver to its holdings on  Monday following a record inflow of about 34 million ounces on Friday,  taking its total to about 621 million ounces.  U.S.-listed mining stocks including First Majestic Silver and Pan American Silver also lost between 4% and 17%.  "It is slowing down a bit," said Gregor Gregersen, founder of Silver Bullion, a dealer in Singapore, after a wild 24 hours where he said sales exceeded average monthly levels from 2018 and orders above S$35,000 ($26,300) arrived every three minutes.  Hedge funds raised their bets against Canadian silver-mining stocks, January short-selling data from a market regulator showed.  Reddit moderators had on Tuesday removed one of the most popular  posts suggesting buying silver and many WallStreetBets posts focused on  riding out the volatility.  "WHO IS HOLDING GME WITH ME?" read one top post. "I'M HOLDING EVEN IF MY PORTFOLIO GOES DOWN TO ZERO," read another.

I mean look at this group compared to last week? It was all GME GME GME and that was barely keeping this thing along. We are divided. I would say AMC is the next short move for now.

lq6688|lat43j|lat43j|-40|Guys, short squeeze is over. If you’re still profitable, take profits. If you’re at a loss, don’t use sunk cost fallacy to continue taking on more losses. The next chapter for GME gains will be written by Ryan Cohen and how his chewy team reimagines and pivots the company over the next two years.   Exit now to cut losses/take profits, and if you agree with the long term bull case that Ryan Cohen will bring to the table, then buy back in when this is back to $40, which it will be very soon.|2021-02-02 07:23:00

If you have significant moneyz in this baby then please go to Ortex and get the FREE TRIAL so you can see the short interest in ABSOLUTE TERMS! I'm seeing a lot of bs about short interest being calculated in a different manner by S3...   Latest update; SI = 27m shares (abt 50% of float), down from 71m 2 weeks ago. Squeeze is still POSSIBLE, but we'll need to organically push this straight to 350 - 400.. I don't see how that's possible now tbh|2021-02-02 06:19:19

lqfzak|lat43j|lat43j|-15|What you have to understand is due to the hype, you have a lot of young investors trying to ride a wave to double or triple what ever they were able to invest. The problem, only a handful of you got out of this with more than what you put in. The unfortunate problem with these movements, just like Occupy Wallstreet, is there was no leader, and once the movement became trendy, it lost passion, and finally lost purpose.   The lesson to be learned here is if you want to be apart of a revolution, then create your own. Don't rely on others to make your decisions. There are no short cuts, there is no easy solution.   In the end, the top 1% that control 85% of wealth will always find a way to win until enough people can unite behind an organized leader to change the dynamic. Until then, we will see this over and over. Some will win, most will lose.  None of those who made it out with more then what they started with are going to come to the rescue of those that lost everything. In the end, you die in your own hands.|2021-02-02 08:41:10

It'll be far cheaper than this disaster.  Because this effort is crashing and crashing fast.  Get out now while you still have some cash.  In a week this game will be done.

We were all cheated out of our EASILY $1000 pt price point by them pulling the plug. At this point if you lose your savings you are just foolish.

lpwghl|lat43j|lat43j|-4|The best biotech opportunity on the NASDAQ:  Ticker: KZIA should be worth $200 right now (current $9.50, $115m mcap) based on the immensely promising drug the company is developing - Paxalisib (in multiple phase 2 trials) - which will in highly likelihood be the new SOC for glioblastoma. There have been no improvements to the SOC for 20+ years. See the latest Analyst report which does no justice to the drug's potential and grossly lowballs the chance of success of approval. Even still they have a PT much higher than the current price.  https://kza.irmau.com/irm/PDF/a9b9d0a9-1f57-4de4-8dc2-9e2e334f22e9/HCWainwrightAUniquePI3KInhibitorforBrainTumorsInitiateWithBuyand17PT  Positives:  - Recent CEO open market buying (28% insider ownership) + options in the money -$19m cash in bank to fund throughout 2021 (no dilution coming) -4 Big data readouts coming in 1H 2021 -TINY FLOAT (6.5m) -TAM is in the multi-billion $ range for glioblastoma alone (+ they are showing efficacy in DIPG & brain metastasis too... think 10s of billions).

If you have a lot of your personal money tied into this - GET OUT NOW. You can always buy back in at a lower price. If you sold yesterday you could still buy in today at this lower price and enjoyed watching GME go to the teens.   My point is, stop living in this cult. Stop making up conspiracies and believing in bullshit and lies just to continue this confirmation bias and stay in this losing emotional trade. Just stop.   You can down vote me all you want, but this is a post for your own good. PLEASE. Retail only controls 15% of GME - you can’t hold your way out of this - you can’t “beat the HFs” when they already own 80% of GME. They are not just holding short contracts but holding the underlying shares like you are. They’re going to profit off their shorts and sell the underlying while taking you under.   PLEASE - WAKE THE FUCK UP - stop meme’ing your way out of reality and patting each other on the back while you burst into flames.

People think that even if it crashes it will recover long term, AND THEY MAY BE RIGHT, but  majority of retail investors cannot hold for years hoping to recover their money, often they need this money to feed their family and to pay rent, people cannot wait 3 years for this to happen, not even several months.

You can still make back your losses buy pulling your money and putting it somewhere that it will actually work for you.

But facts are facts, look at the charts and stop trusting people around here. Go to a decent subreddit like /r/stocks and see what the non-bots are saying.  This is no longer about sending a "message" , this is 100% about making EASY money - oh well, see how that is turning out to be?   Everyone wants to cash out when they can and this will be at your expense.   I'm selling my 1.5 GME's as soon as the market opens, this is bullshit.      Enjoy your "moon" idiots.
