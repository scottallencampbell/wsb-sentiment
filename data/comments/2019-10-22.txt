4r97ec|dlgbuh|dlgbuh|5|Guys, buy the MRK dip. Classic overreaction. DD: I work in that area. The BMS trial was only announced to have met its endpoint, no data yet, so not clear if efficacy is better than Pembrolizumab + chemo. The combo of Nivolumab and Ipimumab (BMS) is known to be more toxic vs. Pembrolizumab (MRK). No Nivolumab only + Chemo arm, so will be hard for FDA to assess if Ipilimumab is actually needed for efficacy. Bottomline: not clear if this will get approved, let alone whether is is the better option compared to Pembrolizumab.   https://pipelinereview.com/index.php/2019102272641/Antibodies/CheckMate-9LA-a-Phase-3-Trial-Evaluating-Opdivo-nivolumab-Plus-Low-Dose-Yervoy-ipilimumab-Combined-with-Chemotherapy-Meets-Primary-Endpoint-Demonstrating-Superior-Overall-Surv.html|2019-10-22 12:15:43

4s51p5|dlgbuh|dlgbuh|9|Ladies and gents, time for **Magical Crayons TA**.  Shockingly TA worked quite well today, with trading action falling into basically the ranges and resistance points [we predicted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dkyw9m/daily_discussion_thread_october_21_2019/f4npgb8/). We hit the 300.7 mark but couldn't break through (contrary to what I anticipated) after a few tests, which resulted in us trading down to the "flat" trading range of 300.5-299.05. We're at the lower end of the bullish pattern, but until 299.05 is taken out, bulls have nothing to worry about in terms of massive plunges downward because of a large bullish trading range, with potential resistance of 302.5 tomorrow by EOD if news is really good. That 299.05 is quite strong, as you noticed that even the attempt of EOD selloff we still managed to push right back to that number.   I want to note again for fellow bears that there are multiple supports that have be taken out before we see a "crash" of any kind. Bulls have lots of technicals set up to prevent a huge plunge intraday so they're protected pretty well. If you believe today's slight downward movement is a sign of things to come, tomorrow's "lower" trading ranges by EOD would be between 298.9 and 297.7. Only if the latter number is taken out will you expect us to see the market fall into another tier of lower trading, but for now things are still neutral to bullish. If we DO tickle 300.1 again tomorrow expect a 40 centish gap fill to 300.5.  Bless your tendies and godspeed.|2019-10-22 15:02:03

On a call option, am I understanding it correctly that there is there two ways to make money if the option is profitable?  That is, I can exercise the option and actually buy the stock and then immediately sell it, or I can actually sell the option itself?  Also same question for the put, but I also don't understand if you have the option to sell above the current price, don't you already have to own the stock to sell it?
