It also justifies my theory that the market is not as efficient as people think though.   Imagine a video conferencing system justifying that P/E ratio. Do you know how cheap and easy it is to make a video conference platform? Everyone will just copy the same set up and bid the price of the service down to the point where it isn't profitable.|2020-06-02 15:19:53

sn3z0p|gv4nuh|gv4nuh|5|NKLA is actually legit. They have some serious tech and execs with experience in the car industry. Already have preorders lined up and will get their first revenue in 2021. They use hydrogen so they are lighter and can travel further than Tesla semi's. The weight is important because it dictates how much you can haul. The range is comparable to diesel but they have better acceleration and other performance metrics and are cheaper to maintain and refuel obviously. They have a very clear path into the very large commercial trucking industry and then can further leverage their tech into other sectors.  The big risk is that it's a capital intensive business and they  will need to build a manufacturing plant and invest in hydrogen stations. This isn't as big of a deal as regular cars though because semi routes are more standardized.|2020-06-02 10:06:55

snvbmm|gv4nuh|gv4nuh|5|here's the way my trading generally goes, spread out over the course of a week:  day 1) make what I believe to be a good play. play goes bad, sell at a big loss  day 2) make what I believe to be a good play to make back the losses but not much more. a less risky play just to recover. this also goes tits up and so now I'm down even more  day 3) think of literally the dumbest possible play I can make. without thinking any more than that, enter into said play.  day 4) play from day before prints like mad and I am now overconfident. do some absolutely RAD DD and enter into another play.  day 5) this play ends up fucking me harder than the sweet sweet sound of jpow's BRRR sex noise and I lost all my profits and now am down 25% on the week.  rinse repeat weekly until my portfolio is dead|2020-06-02 13:44:51

soe7gk|gv4nuh|gv4nuh|3|How many bad decisions can I make on a single play? Let me count the ways:   Had CRWD calls when they were at $82 a share, sold on the first pop Friday...before the second pop Friday afternoon.   Decided over the weekend to YOLO first thing Monday morning. Had everything lined up for the buy, the Call I was looking at ROCKETED up 50% in the first moments of the day spooked me and I didn’t pull the trigger until it was up another 30%. FOMOed in at pretty much the top.   Spent all day today looking at a 50% loss, got freaked out about holding through earnings.   Sold 3/4s of my position for a loss at 3:45 today.   Decided to hedge with puts just in case shit went south.   Just finished up a demo at work to see how fucked I am...and sure enough they blew away earnings and I should never have doubted my vibe.|2020-06-02 16:12:18

sno3ut|gv4nuh|gv4nuh|2|So I had unintentionally tried to deposit too much money into my account two weeks ago and it was returned by my bank. I sold out of my positions last Thursday to pay off the margin call, and I’m restricted until I can deposit the actual amount into my account. One of my positions I sold was a bunch of GLW 24c that I had bought at 0.11 and sold at 0.5. On Friday those calls dropped down to 0.22. I wanted to buy back in but I couldn’t. Now they’re at over 0.6. If I hadn’t been so stupid I could’ve already tripled my money. Instead I’m sitting in cash, unable to buy, shedding a tear for missed tendies.|2020-06-02 12:48:20

sn2d7e|gv4nuh|gv4nuh|6|Disclaimer: not a bear and not a bull. Just someone who is real fucking uneasy.   I am trying to understand the US market. It is slowly but surely climbing back to ATH. Obviously money printers help. But other than that... where is the rally coming from?   The bear case is extraordinary. Riots, looting, likely 2nd wave, no travel, no tourism. Who the fuck is going to want to visit the states now, even if they could?   Despite this stocks keep rising. So obviously the bear case means nothing. People say stocks are forward looking but I look forward and see 100k more deaths from covid, continued civil unrest and no real redeeming quality. Next earnings are going to be a shitshow.   While I'm blind and stupid I'm not retarded. I'm not going to gamble it goes down when I am clearly wrong. So why am I wrong? Is money printer > everything?|2020-06-02 09:53:32

sn0344|gv4nuh|gv4nuh|1|You decide to go play some roulette at the casino. You call up a taxi. “You’re in luck!” the taxi driver says. “I just came from there. There’s a table rigged to always come up black! You’re gonna be rich!” You smile and nod.  As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. “You’re in luck buddy! There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.  You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.  As you lay your cash down and load up on puts you give Big Jay a wink. "Red".  You see the confused expression on Big Jay’s face as he spins the wheel. “Black” he calls with a sigh.  “This game is fucking rigged!” you shout as your puts expire worthless.|2020-06-02 09:34:07

For others who also don't know, it's learning management software, and it's been going up steadily. And now, after all these protests, with the likely second wave, I can't see how more schools and businesses won't have to be adapting to remote tools like this.    I'm going in.|2020-06-02 12:46:59

Yes I’m an idiot for getting these restrictions but RH lost me over 100% on inovio the day it tanked back in March and I couldn’t sell cause RH was glitching.
