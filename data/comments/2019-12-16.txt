Thanks to the China trade war, I guess.   Now that Trump is too distracted by impeachment trials, someone in the White House is saying LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF regarding the China tariffs, which were just a whim enacted via executive order by a power-hungry madman.  And since early October markets have been shooting up about 5 percent per month.   But, last Christmas we saw, they can go SHARPLY DOWN by 20 percent for NO KNOWN REASON.

b4qlgy|ebdrtu|ebdrtu|7| "The US exported $188 billion of goods and services to China in 2017 which is the benchmark year for the agreement. Raising that amount by at least $200 billion would target US$388 billion in exports of goods and services by the end of 2021 or a 2.1 fold increase. If instead we started from the present level of exports to China which was roughly US$175 billion, then getting to the target would mean a roughly 2¼ fold increase."     " The US exported about US$9.2 billion in total agricultural products to the US in 2018 (here) and is tracking less than that this year. To achieve US$40-50 billion in agricultural exports to China in each of the next two years would require expanding the total by 4-5 times by the end of 2021.

b4mykb|ebdrtu|ebdrtu|3|Once Antares gets setrogel finished with Idorsia it would bring its revenues slightly higher than that of AMRN. And that’s not even including the Pfizer undisclosed project, growing Xyosted subscriptions (Spread to EU as well), growing Epipen subs. Would possibly wait as we are currently stuck in a range but I’d bet my entire net worth this will surpass 16 a share next year. Volume fading though so just waiting game now and gambling with my remaining cash. 16s the more conservative end of analyst estimates as well. Good watchlist addition|2019-12-16 09:58:41

TD having 0.65 contract fees would have at least left me with 0.35 I wont have when it expires. But it's the pride of it, not even the gamble that we'll just maybe suddenly drop $4.   I just don't even need the $0.35 tbh... I don't even want it. Makes me feel better knowing I let an option expire on *my* terms and not anything else. 😤|2019-12-16 12:38:22

b5cetn|ebdrtu|ebdrtu|2|Some quick DD for WSB. MU likely will beat current quarter estimates. They’re really low even if you’re modeling with conservative assumptions. If they don’t beat the sell-side estimates, MU is really fucking up and guidance will show it.  However, MU is running up so much before earnings (now higher than prior quarter), this may mean that there are even higher earnings estimates from the buy-side than the sell-side. This may lead to a drop even if there is a beat on the average public forecast... also leaves limited upside on long calls and more for bearish positions.   Selling FD bear call spreads 6-10% OTM might be the most likely to win. After that, way OTM puts several weeks out, month+ exp out.|2019-12-16 13:37:34

Has it been running up every month since the announcement of last trial data set points. You can never accurately guess without risk because could go either way even on good news. Pharmas a bitch. Sooo many factors and most of the time you sit by watching stocks fly up 100% but missed it and don’t wanna risk buying tops.

Im not your average hack, have free time, decent (not compared to you gangsters) income, no kids, and am recently single and down to take risk within a certain threshold. I don’t have any trading knowledge, or that dad or friend to coach me on this. Can someone recommend some literature to come up to speed on trading, so I can begin making plays and hopefully gaining more from this sub and investing beyond my conservative 401k (recently upped from near zero to federal max contribution) General advice is super appreciated too.

b4dy03|ebdrtu|ebdrtu|-4|Look at the bears. Continuing to point to fundamentals as if they are so terrible and constantly deterioting.   As if that is actually a good justification to buy short term puts lol. God you are so bad at this.   Buy leap puts if you have fundamental reasons to believe it’s gonna come crashing down.  Remember how long burry has to baghold to win in the end? The music is going to keep playing for a long fucking time. This can be propped for ages. You do not know any better and Damn sure ain’t good at timing. Clueless asses, new highs are constantly being printed and your idea is to just “buying OtM puts here , for a few weeks out since my Wendy’s paycheck can’t afford me better options. But this is for sure the top, shit looks bad fundamentals and technical ”  Dumb commie fucks betting against America. Fed will continue to shove green dildos up your asses.
