r04x5z|m5hbpf|m5hbpf|28|Anyone else bullish on APHA? This is NOT a meme stonk plug.   I've been in it since it was sub $10 and have taken some profits. Nothing HUGE because I wanted to see where it was going, but I'm kind of liking how things are looking pre-tlry merger.   I know APHA likely doesn't NEED tlry from the way things look...but hear me out. I know big tobacco has been planning for this day to come. If these small companies want to survive and control market share once weed is legalized...they're really going to need as much capital and credit as they can get their hands on.  I foresee Apple-like lawsuits about everything from packaging to manufacturing processes to biological IP for cultivation and even plant genetics. The corn industry and tobacco are two prime examples of how big subsidized corps can drive out smaller companies.  This is one of the main reasons I'm personally interested in seeing the merger go through. A company like SNDL will get all the press right now...but the bigger companies or companies preparing to battle once they get into the legal market are the ones I can see making it.|2021-03-15 06:55:21

For a industry that shut down fully and also the company being on the edge of bankruptcy and making thru it is a tall tale sign of what can come once they actually start showing films again. Prices will never be lower then it is now for AMC. People miss the theaters, studios miss the big screen cash they get. Hell certain films like Marvels Black Widow and the next 007 Bond film are on hold until theaters open.  It may not super moon like we want but AMC is gonna Moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-03-15 11:47:26

Bought 5 @274 on 3/11 Sold a tight stop @265 on 3/11  Bought again on 3/12 with partial order as follows 3 @292 3 @288  Chase triggered a wash sale but is saying my cost basis is 317 and 309 for these partials. I can't seem to figure this out because I lost 9/share but the new cost basis is more than that.   Also, does the wash sale keep being attached if I were to purchase more today?

If you don't feel you can afford GME now, grab some AMC.  They are going to the same planet.   For everyone else.  Buy a share and then make a t-shirt to wear around.  Apes that see you in your 💎🙌🚀 t-shirt will give you a grunt of acceptance.    You don't need 1000 shares to get involved.  You can join the 🚀 party with just 1 share or even a tiny bit of a share.

Coming out with gains of only 100 dollars is pretty good after being down two and half fucking grand for most of February. Way I see it, this is a win-win, if it starts meaningfully rising again I can buy back in for about as many shares as I had the first time, and I'll eat the loss profits as the price of being a doubter.

r1moym|m5hbpf|m5hbpf|3|> On January 21, Comex declared a "liquidation only" order. The longs could no longer buy, they could only sell to bullion dealers and other commercial investors (i.e., the shorts). Not coincidentally, nine members of the Comex Board held a total of 75 million ounces of silver in short positions and stood to benefit tremendously from the new regulation. This strategic manipulation of the rules of transaction reaffirmed the control of the exchange and reversed the speculative mania.4 The price of silver immediately began to decline, bottoming out at $10.80 per ounce on March 28, 1980|2021-03-15 14:16:43

r095np|m5hbpf|m5hbpf|1|Can I get some answers?  1) why is AMZ getting shilled to fuck every time GME moves?  2) why do people telling you to buy AMZ refuse to accept that the float is being diluted by 500m shares?  3) why are people telling you to buy AMZ only have things to say like "everyone loves the magic of the cinema experience"... do you realise that literally looks like scripted advertising?  4) why are people telling you to buy AMZ without acknowledging the financial health of the company? Accrued $950mm *additional* debt to fulfil their covenants, otherwise their creditors would take over the assets and liquidate the company.  5) why are people telling you to buy AMZ to "save our cinemas"? Buy a stock because **it makes you money**, because the company makes money. Not because you're there as a reserve coffer for their poor financial management.  6) why are people telling you to buy AMZ and acting like the share dilution was a good thing? It devalued your portfolio. The company literally took a decision that cost you money as an investor.  7) what is the growth strategy of AMZ? How will AMZ guarantee a ROI that rivals GME? (Only using GME as an example because the two are forced into an ugly marriage by pushers and idiots).  8) why do people keep telling you to look at how identical AMZ and GME are? ... when they aren't looking themselves. If you look. The two diverged WEEKS AGO.  9) why has there been a huge influx of "AMZ and GME" posts even though the stock has relatively not moved compared to GME and retail investors have a much smaller relative position on AMZ? I'm getting at this idea of media manipulation.   10) why have I been skeptical and criticising AMZ for a month now and still have NO ANSWERS to any of these questions?|2021-03-15 07:45:30

r1aol5|m5hbpf|m5hbpf|-3|$OCDX     I have posted about this company \~3-4 times today. But here's a good explanation of what they do and why I think they're about to take off.     Imagine you go to the ER because you're fainting 3 days a week. They bring you in and take blood, do a spinal tap, and swab your throat. They're looking for viruses, cancer, bacteria, etc. (each of which there are hundreds of species of). The tubes all get sent down to the lab where a tech has to run a test that was designed to be run by hand. There are robots that do these tests for us...but they're just running the same tests. And those tests have error that comes out when robots do them that you would normally just call human error if someone was doing them with their hands in the lab. But the truth is...the test itself was subject to a ton of error.  OCDX builds new tests that have less probability of error and causing false test results. Ultimately bringing down costs for the hospital because they don't have to pay a tech to run it 3-4 times and ULTIMATELY saving patients time and money because the tests are more accurate on the first  go.  This isn't to say that you're going to get bad results the way we do it now...but it will happen faster. And in hospitals...faster=more patients per hour= more lives saved     So there's my non-technical but industry-involved assessment of OCDX.|2021-03-15 12:47:36

r00gcq|m5hbpf|m5hbpf|-10|Not trying to start a fight but can someone answer a couple questions for me ?  1: Why do people think shorting stocks is a good thing ?  2: why are we ok driving the price of a company down to profit? 3: if a company was going to fail wouldn’t it happen on its own without the outside help from someone artificially driving the price down to “scare people away from a bad investment?”   I want to actually have a discussion with someone against GME. I want to know why your opinion of a stocks value is right and people willing to pay for the stocks price right now is wrong. In my own personal opinion I believe a company or stock should have the value that people are willing to pay for it. If we are willing to pay 200+ dollars for a stock and it’s value drops because people who bought into before the price got that high sold , it’s one thing, but to drive a price down by borrowing shares that you do not own so people will also sell their investment is wrong. Imagine for a second that the short squeeze is over. Imagine it already happened and the price dropped from 483 to 40. Why did it go back up? People bought the stock because they like it. Forget the short interest at this point. Pretend it doesn’t matter. Gme went from 40 back to the 300 range despite the shorts “covering”. This company is valuable because we say it is. This company is worth this price because we are willing to pay for it. If you think it’s “over valued” that’s your opinion. You don’t have to buy into it. Since the beginning of market, hedge funds have been driving prices down on purpose. I’ve read articles that say shorting is healthy for the market because it exposes fraud in a company. It shows a company’s true value. To this I say no. I say it exposes the people willing to hold onto their investment. It exposes people who say no I am willing to buy more shares at this price. If you are shorting GME to recoup losses from the run up than you are investing wrong. If you are buying GME to recoup losses from the first run up you are investing wrong. (You should have never sold bitch) we like the stock. If you like it buy it. If you hate the stock. Move on. Don’t buy it|2021-03-15 05:51:49

r0suje|m5hbpf|m5hbpf|0|Wanna hear some bullshit?  A few days ago I woke up to find out I had to stay under a margin line because I accidentally used the wrong bank account to deposit funds with. So I owed Robinhood like $3k I think. So I was like alright easy enough, sold a bunch of stock and kept my options. No longer owed anything, the margin line was gone, and it still said I couldn’t buy anything even though I had tons of extra money in buying power. Here’s a pic of what my portfolio looks like at this moment, still not able to buy anything yet it looks squeaky clean: https://i.imgur.com/Zd0YDdU.jpg  Here’s what it looks like when I try to purchase: https://i.imgur.com/G9mviVg.jpg  Here’s their bullshit email to me when I asked wtf was up on Friday: https://i.imgur.com/DyUzOvT.jpg  They claim they can’t let me buy things bc of a $700 deposit. And get this, I STARTED THAT DEPOSIT AFTER I SENT THE SUPPORT EMAIL ASK. So they’re saying they restricted my account because they knew that in a day I would be making a $700 deposit which apparently isn’t cool to do now?  I followed up that email being pissed off and demanding they get my portfolio moved to a different trading broker. And guess what they said? Nothing. Those greedy fuckers restricted my account and then ghosted me so I’m stuck with them.|2021-03-15 10:36:19

r0kpy7|m5hbpf|m5hbpf|-2| Record-low mortgage rates and shortage of inventory are keeping the US housing market strong concerning buyer demand. Prices have been surging month-over-month breaking new records. The government’s moratoria have effectively stopped foreclosure activity on everything but vacant and abandoned properties. 2020 ended the year with a near-record number of seriously delinquent loans, but historically low levels of foreclosure activity.      * At the current rate of improvement, 1.8 million mortgages will still be seriously delinquent at the end of June when foreclosure moratoriums on government-backed loans are currently slated to lift *  *“January foreclosure activity declined at least in part due to the Biden Administration’s decision to continue the foreclosure moratorium on government-backed loans through the end of March,” said Rick Sharga, RealtyTrac executive vice president.*   They gonna keep making bears wait or will we get to eat soon? #HOMELESS|2021-03-15 09:33:23
