I am, atleast right now, very happy I did.  And Tegards. They are long dated. Short dated puts make a lot of sense as a hedge in a bull market and long dated do not. Why? Because in a bull the market is running away from them.  In a bear a slightly OTM long dated put is the best play. Why? Because the market is coming BACK for them and you have time to ride out ferocious bear rallies that a short dated put cannot.   I still won't be surprised if we rip after CPI. Like I said, I think it will surprise to the downside because of timing and commodities. And because most of you tegards think a smaller number means prices aren't going up still! Now I don't care. Earnings will soon dominate the entire discussion.  Best of luck. I'm feeling stoic because just toured some of the Normandy beaches today. Y'all owe your grand dads or great grand dads respect.

Untethered to the physical office, many tech employees moved to the suburbs, second-home communities or smaller, less densely populated cities. As more people returned to major cities and began to work from the office again, at least part of the time, tech market apartment rents reversed course.  >According to Apartment List, the median rent for 20 key U.S. tech cities bottomed out in December 2020. Eighteen cities saw declines, ranging from 26% in San Francisco to 1% in Atlanta. Phoenix and San Diego were the only major cities where apartment rents rose, benefiting from net in-migration early in the pandemic. Apartment rents began to climb again in spring 2021 when companies attempted to execute return-to-office plans. However, when COVID-19 cases spiked in fall 2021, most companies delayed their office return and the apartment rent recovery stalled.  >As return-to-the-office plans have regained momentum this year, apartment rents have resumed their rise. All 20 tech cities have rent levels at least equal to pre-pandemic highs. San Francisco is the exception as apartment rents remain 8.8% below the February 2020 level. Phoenix and San Diego continue to set the long-term pace for apartment rent growth, with gains of 34% and 32%, respectively, since February 2020. However, the biggest gains this year have occurred in Redmond, WA, and New York City where apartment rents are up 16% and 12%, respectively.|2022-10-11 11:34:39rwoxb9|y150wr|y150wr|3|Ray Dalio: Chinese economy has major issues now.

PER 14x isn't actually that great if growth totally evaporates - or reverses - it's pretty boring. I mean you can buy literally the average Euro or Japanese stock for 40% less than that.  TSM is only special when it's hypergrowth. It's not hypergrowth. It's maybe even going to be anti-growth for a few years.  This year, TSM has become an average company with an added risk of China fucking everything up unexpectedly.  I don't know if you were watching TSM's price in 2000, last time we had a big tech/hype recession.  TSM went from $27 to $4 ===  (2000->2002)  Another thing. Shitloads of Taiwanese people hold TSM as a big part of their savings (I say savings, I mean gamblings). It's like 50% of the stockmarket in Taiwan. And there are a lot of people there who tend to follow the crowd. A lot.

Is that right Josh Brown. What would you have them do? Stop now. And when inflation roars back at 11% do you want the FED to raise rates to 12%. 20%.  Josh. I came of age in 1979. Graduated from high school. Dropped out of college in 80 and had to survive the worst recession since the great depression. And I'm not a dumb fuck Josh Brown. I managed to get back to college and graduate as a Chemical Engineer. We actually use the second derivative to get shit done, not to sound smart on TV. I also got my minor in Economics and an MBA. What do you got kid? My fascination with economics has lasted my entire life and I believe I could hold my own with any PhD from Yale.  Someday, son, you will be old and wise and recognize that once you have screwed the pooch there ain't no way to unscrew it. You just got to fix it. FED has to crush inflation now. Thank the Lord the FED isn't run by stock brokers like you.  Somebody send this to him.  PS; Hey Josh.
