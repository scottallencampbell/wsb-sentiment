7e3ut0|j3rz7r|j3rz7r|15|I am coming from the future to tell you this.  It's October the 12th. Papa Pump entering the press conference, waving his right arm fabulously as the mass applauds him. Fearlessly he starts talking:  "Today after I finished my second Big Mac for breakfast at 8.00am I was thinking. How can people even die from this weak China Virus? The past two weeks, I had a team of 50 top  physicians taking care of me. They are the best physicians, better than anybody has ever seen before. And they did a great job. But you know what? I didn't need any of this. I fought the China Virus, I defeated it. I make America great and I have done things nobody ever even has thought about. Bears r fuk."

When it dips towards low 400 levels, it ALWAYS bounces up hard. On top of that, Tesla has been bleeding almost every Thursday and Friday, while it gaps up significantly on Monday and then a little on Tuesdays. The same thing seems to be happening here. If it drops another 2-3% I'll have to get in again, otherwise I'm staying cash gang this weekend.

Orange man got corona which spooked the market right after I removed my short futures hedge. In a exemplar of supreme retardation, I switched to long futures when the news came out. Losses extended to 1.8k at some point, but was able to diamond hand until loss reduced to 1k. Had I diamond handed till market open, would actually turned a profit.

7eetyy|j3rz7r|j3rz7r|1|NIO just released very good delivery numbers for its September sales ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-reports-154-3-increase-083420899.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-reports-154-3-increase-083420899.html)). It is down premarket by about 4% as a part of the overall down turn. (My guess is based on current news about DT). If you are looking to get in at a discount today might be the day. Analysts are expecting it to settle at $24 and with solid earnings there will be some more revisions higher. I cannot guarantee what the fluctation will be today but if you are looking at long term it is dong well.|2020-10-02 08:30:15

7eipmw|j3rz7r|j3rz7r|1|I feel like I turned a new leaf. For the first time I sold immediately at open not caring which way the market would go. I knew the futures were big in my direction so no need to risk it. Nio 22p 10/2 and IWM 147p 10/9. Locked in about 50% gains and promised myself I wouldn't look at it even if it kept going down. And of course everything continued to shoot up and I would've lost all my profit. If I started doing this sooner, I'd be profitable right now instead of sitting on a -70% account. lol|2020-10-02 09:08:03
