1xtmuj|tm2f53|tm2f53|3|USA wants to limit Russia’s ability to use gold as a way to get around sanctions. This essentially cuts off Russia’s $130b in gold reserves from the global supply.  How will this affect the price of gold on the open market?  I can see it going one of two ways: 1) less supply, and therefore price should go up 2) less demand (since gold isn’t able to do the thing it’s supposed to be good at, which is to deploy its stored value at a time when fiat currency is unattractive or absent), therefore price should go down  For now it’s up, but I dunno...thoughts?

You are being fed, clothed, raised, and reared for at least 18 years solely so you can go and work for another man. All the hard work you put into your nonexistence - clinging to the void, swimming slow in the sperm race, kicking in the womb out of protest. All of it has one simple result: your body is more exploitable for the men that will exploit you in every hole.  You're alive? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way you grew up, who exploits you. He gets to exploit you every day. He gets the benefits of your kind and sweet personality that came from the way you were born.

Their public financials are already wonky as they claim to be paying off debt, yet issuance is up YoY (they are funding buybacks by taking on debt) while cash flow is the lowest it's been in years and trending towards negative by end of 2022. Then losses they're claiming are for "investment in tech" is actually them spending billions to fix internal issues that came up when they almost failed a government audit.  Yet the stock is up 80% since 2019.

1yondt|tm2f53|tm2f53|-17|For any of you luddites still doubting Ryan and GME think about this before you write it off one last time.  Forget the huge gains all the apes have cashed in over the past week they are peanuts.  Lets look to the future where the GME NFT marketplace is now the hub of all gaming.    You have NFTs on a GME blockchain that will never get turned off.  All of the items you buy in games will be tied to NFTs on the marketplace so you will never lose them.  All the user has to do is load up their GME NFT wallet with GME coins and then they are free to purchase any used games or items within a game.  This is revolutionary.    Imagine making profit from items you sold two months ago because someone else sold it for more.  The network effect will ensure this expands exponentially.  Soon you could make a living off of the marketplace :)   Anything from new NFT games like cosmetics or upgrades or even stat points will be bought and traded.  If this gets even 1% of the steam market (way more since they are ao stupid they are ignoring NFTs) GME coins will skyrocket and $GME could easily hit $5,000 and much higher (due to high short interest and a technical squeeze).|2022-03-24 13:30:55

So by that logic, the recent market run up is pricing in the end of the Ukraine-Russia war. Feds have stated that they are hesitant to make major decisions policy wise due to the ongoing geopolitical issues going on in Ukraine. Clearly, the fed has not stopped QE nor are they shaving the balance sheet with the recent $1.8T in reverse repos recently reported. This means after the war is over, the feds will actually follow through with ending QE and actually shave the balance sheet. The market has already priced in the end of the war so there will be no reason to buy back in. This will result in a massive market crash.    Who am I kidding?

On the desk, skeptics tried to take back the reins as CTA tailwinds were supplanted by a growing pension headwinds along with tactical bias to fade equity risk >SPX 4500.    In Tech, uniform caution remains the consensus trade and cash needs a place to go (AAPL +1%, AMZN back to flat, TSLA escape velocity), while ADBE's lower guidance pressured SaaS comps (HUBS).|2022-03-24 08:22:54

Limit price of $7.50 would result in a maximum loss of $750.00). As long as I have, and am willing to lose $750, I cant get boned any harder than that right?
