bvmbu7|eej9lm|eej9lm|4|I want a service that offers Mini or fractional options. Instead of 100 it‚Äôs let‚Äôs say, 10/25/50 or whatever. (Probably not 25, 10 seems easiest to implement.   I want to join Theta gang again since I stopped using RH mostly, and TD doesn‚Äôt let me trade credit spreads.   So how great would it be to be able to buy 10 shares of a company, vs 100, and sell Mini calls against those.   For example, buying 100 shares of AMD is $4500 roughly (or whatever it‚Äôs ripped to by now today). That‚Äôs a little more than double my account (guys I know, i know, a couple grand isn‚Äôt shit, but 80% of you probably don‚Äôt play with that much either and we live modest lives so stick with me for a sec)  Imagine buying 10 shares of AMD. $450. Then selling the ‚ÄúFractional‚Äù or mini calls against those. (Maybe AMD is a poor example to sell calls against,  but swap it for whatever sub $100 ticker you want.)  Only problem is volume. Will there be many people buying the option to purchase 10 shares of a company? So in reality it could only really work on SPY and a select few Blue Chips that are far more than $50 a share. Those might have the volume to add a whole new option chain.   Idk I‚Äôm just thinking out loud with my meager account. Want to sell calls, but I‚Äôm not about to buy a couple hundred shares of effin $ACB to do it. But 10 shares of PTON? Super affordable. 100 shares?
