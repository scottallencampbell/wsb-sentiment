To nobody's surprise these next, next-gen consoles don't even have disc drives because everyone buys digital copies directly from the device. wallstreetbets is unfazed and eagerly listens in to the GME Q3 2027 earnings report.      > GameStop’s chief executive officer, said, “Our third quarter results were in-line with our muted expectations and reflected operating during the last few months of a disc-less, digital version only console cycle, which pressured sales and earnings. That notwithstanding, we continued to significantly advance our strategic objectives of selling overpriced small collectibles and Skullcandy headphones.      "Buy the dip!", they cried!

It’s pretty simple tho, they’re pulling our data by scrubbing the discussion threads. These programs look for key words.

g9pg4l|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|12|# People, think about this shit before you follow a pumped / hyped ticker or DD:  WSB is becoming a household name due to all of the media exposure over the past year, *at least*.  If your fat mom recognizes it, *you know everyone in the financial industry knows about us*.  # Why does this matter?  Because prop traders / firms, hedgies, etc, etc are just as fucked up and mischievous as we are.  They likely resent us / dislike us / see us as the fun-to-beat-up-fat-kid from fourth grade.      # Why does this matter?  Because they write / do DD for a fucking *living* and have for fucking years.  # Why does this matter?  Because it would take 15-30 mins to sit down and write convincing DD in the direction that they're pretty fucking sure the ticker *won't go*.  They also know if they include the requisite opening insults, some rocket ships, and pictures, we'll jump right the fuck in without even looking at the fucking chart.  # Why does this matter?

g8um4a|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|5|Today I'm thinking of opening my first positions on ASAN and MP.  Both have had a great month due to good earnings, so the entry is not the best.  I'm thinking of opening 30/25 put credit spreads on both of them for January cycle.  If my timing is wrong I will sell the long and take assignment of the shares with the short put.  I'm cautious since this is the first time I'm playing with this tickers, plus MP entered through a SPAC, I have to search if any MP shares are coming out of lock up.  ASAN I like a lot, I'm using their platform in my research lab and it has helped increase the productivity of the group so far.|2020-12-18 06:38:51

g9jm5e|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|6|Here are a list of Apple products you cannot buy for Christmas because they are sold out, according to Barron’s today:  •	⁠iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max  •	⁠iPad, iPad Pro  •	⁠iPad Air  •	⁠iPad Mini  •	⁠MacBook Air and Pro  •	⁠i MAC and i Mac Pro  •	⁠HomePod mini  I’ll also add that AirPods Max are sold out in every color and online ordering has a three month waitlist.  Some of this was due to some supply disruptions due to Covid, sure, but there has also been insane demand. This does not consider how many signups there have been for Apple’s new subscription bundle. I myself now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life on this bundle.  I have 10% of my net worth in Apple calls. Half are LEAPS, half expire right after the ER.|2020-12-18 10:34:50

g9mifq|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|3|I'm always hesitant about giving stock advice but I'm fairly confident on this one. HALO  They have had a huge run up this year (like many others) but there is still more to come. Today is actually when a big number of $44 call options expire. I suspect that the big spender has been selling calls to collect premium and has been pushing the price down below $44.  You can see the past month or so it's been consolidating between $41 and $43. I believe with the new price target of $50 by Berenberg Bank announced the other day in addition to the expiration of the calls will push HALO up in the next few weeks.  Other things to consider:  1.

g91ce8|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|9|Tesla’s rise this year has been driven by options and hype. Think about it, every big jump this year was on some news that may or may not come to fruition, or beating quarterly “deliveries” by like 12 cars. It’s a top ten market cap and owns less than a percent of market share in its primary industry.  It’s not a tech company. There are better FSD companies out there. It’s not a battery company, it buys its batteries from the same source that GM does. At a minimum, it’s going to start to face real competition in the EV space now that every big legacy automaker is reading the tea leaves and jumping into the market. Elon floated the “consider merging with another carmaker” news because he knows all this and that’s exactly what he wants.  If you’ve made money on the rise, congrats, so did I.  But you should also be prepared to make money on the fall.  Tesla has value, but probably more in the 100-200bn range.  Only question is when, not if|2020-12-18 07:58:02

Typical daily volume is 60M, so a potentially 4x volume day.  Adjusted for the split, there were a few days above 200 Million in early this year feb. 3rd 4th 5th.   Those days had \~15% intra day movement, 3rd finished up \~16% 4th was flat, 5th was down 10%.  So, TLDR, should we expect 15% movement today? that would see an intraday high at 750 from a low of 653 today.|2020-12-18 10:34:27

gacmjf|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|2|Question semi related to covered calls. I saw a recovery strat for when you own shares that have tanked.  For every 100 shares you buy one atm call and sell 2 otm calls for $0 net. It basically lets you enter a covered call and a vertical call spread.   Ex. You own ABC and bought at 10. It goes to 5. You buy a $5c and sell 2x 7.5c. That way the stock only had to recover to $7.50 for you to break even instead of $10.  My question is, why not do this for every stock, even ones you arent bagholding? Wouldn't it double your gains essentially with no added risk? It does cap your gains but so do covered calls.|2020-12-18 13:59:43

g94ft7|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|7|I don’t know what to say, really. Three minutes to the biggest battle of our professional lives. All comes down to today, and either, we heal as a sub,, or we’re gonna crumble. cent by cent, dollar  by dollar. Until we’re finished. We’re in hell right now, gentlemen. Believe me. And, we can stay here, get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell… one dollar at a time.   Now I can’t do it for you, I’m too old. I look around, I see these young faces and I think, I mean, I’ve made every wrong choice a middle-aged man can make. I, uh, I’ve pissed away all my money, believe it or not. I chased off all those chances to buy TSLA pre-split. And lately, I can’t even stand to look at my positions on my phone. You know, when you get old, in life, things get taken from you. I mean, that’s… that’s… that’s a part of life. But, you only learn that when you start blowing up account after account. You find out life’s this game of dollars, so is investing...err gambling. Because in either game – life or investing – the margin for error is so small. I mean, one click a little too late or too early and you end up buying the top. One half second too slow, too fast and your options expire worthless. The dollars we need are everywhere around us. They’re in every dip of the market, every retarded meme stock, every potential GME short squeeze.   On this sub we fight for that dollar. On this sub we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that dollar. We claw with our fingernails for that dollar. Because we know when we add up all those dollars that’s gonna make the fucking difference between margin calls and tendie town, between Lambos and corollas!   I’ll tell you this, in any fight it’s the guy who is willing to go broke who is gonna win that dollar. And I know, if I’m gonna have any life anymore it’s because I’m still willing to go broke and die for those tendies, because that’s what living is!...the next potential 10-bagger in front of your face.    Now I can’t make you do it. You’ve got to look at the retard next to you, look into his eyes. Now I think you going to see a retard is willing to lose all of his college tuition. Youre gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for these tendies, because he knows when it comes down to it you’re gonna keep buying otm FDs too. That’s this sub gentlemen, and either, we heal, now, as a sub, or we will die as individuals. That’s r/wsb guys, that’s all it is. Now, what are you gonna do?|2020-12-18 08:28:54

What I say you do is get some calls about 2-3 months out, just outside the money. I am looking at $170-$175 for Feb since there are no March calls. IV is fairly low for those too, around 40%.

g9kpxx|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|1|Could somebody please explain to me the concept of "rolling."  I buy an under-priced option, it eventually bears fruit in the from of a price increase and accompanying increase in IV.  Fine.  At that point the option has reached its full value, and any additional future value will already be priced into longer dated calls.   Why would you buy longer dated calls without much upside available?  Continued and swift price increase would be one reason, but in the absence of that, would one not just hold the shares?  What I don't understand is, an option can blow its load into profitability, but beyond that, it's pretty much done. It's like you have one shot to shoot your shot, before everyone knows about it.  Am I making sense?|2020-12-18 10:42:35

gaauup|kfj3tm|kfj3tm|1|Norwegian Airlines (NWARF) just did a 100:1 reverse split which leaves them with under 400k shares and with current stock price, a $2.45 million market cap. This IMO is a buy right now for an extremely undervalued stock. Even if they declare bankruptcy, the planes they have as assets are worth MUCH more than their market cap. The Norwegian govt has propped them up through COVID. Also, why wouldn't another larger airline come in and buy them? Am I thinking about this all wrong? This seems like a great deal.   Edit: Never mind, total debt is $52B...|2020-12-18 13:46:56

I am worried that my 700c will be exercised to  purchase the stock for the 720c and then I will be left with $2k cash and lose a position worth $10k :( I'm not good at math but I'm pretty sure you can get more tendies w/ 10k than 2k.  &#x200B;  However, if the 700c is sold instead of executed, I would be okay with that net credit of 9-10k  &#x200B;  Should I create some type of fancy order to protect my self?|2020-12-18 12:27:02
