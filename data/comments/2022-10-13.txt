s5ftzq|y2uq32|y2uq32|12|This will be the worst global economic crisis since **at least** the Great Depression.  Central banks can't cut rates.  Companies can't rely on China for growth.  US Federal Debt is over $93,000 per citizen.  On average, this debt is paid off by issuing new debt around once every five years.  At these rates, interest on the debt will soon overtake *all other Federal government spending*.  There is no political willpower to meaningfully raise taxes or cut spending.  Even if there was, raising taxes or cutting spending further bones the economy.  They can't (sanely) boost growth by starting a war.  What happens when you go into an economic crisis but you can't lower interest rates or rely on stimulus?  We are set up for either the mother of all crashes or, worse, hyperinflation.

I think Nasdaq 16000 will be like Nasdaq 5000 back in 2000.  Will take us 10 years to get back up there.  Buy and hold won't be a great strategy, will have to be much more opportunistic buying and selling in a rangebound market.|2022-10-13 08:40:56

s5gm7m|y2uq32|y2uq32|17|Why are all of these idiots betting on a fed pivot/pause?    People need to get a damn grip.  A soft landing is a pipedream.  File that one right next to inflation is transient, the inflation reduction act, and Putin's price hikes.    A significant recession is going to be required to purge inflation.  The fed needs to stop telegraphing everything and needs to shock the market into submission, by doing things like surprise rate hikes on a Sunday just like Volcker did.  Come in with 100 bps.  The fed is still far too accommodating. Real interest rates are negative.  Volcker didn't pound inflation into submission until he had +3% real interest rates. That means the Fed needs to get to a target of 9-11% interest rates if it wants to be on a positive real interest rate side that might actually do something to kill inflation.    Stop listening to these crybabies on wall street now whining about over tightening and the fed making a mistake.

Nowhere near enough for a gain post, but I bought a 10/14 $360 SPY Put yesterday for $6.40 and sold it today at $12.00. Took the $560 in profit and put it straight into 7+ shares of VT and am now up $20 on that. I'm going to withdraw the $640 I initially gambled with.  Overall picture: after initial success following you all into GME going up about $3.5k total, I'm down $2k or \~50% overall over 5 years (some of that is overall market loss). I'm down about $1k in realized losses just this year so that $560 is tax free!  I generally only use money for this degenerate gambling that I know I can lose, but have gotten in deep enough that I know how easy it is to lose your head.

s54u3y|y2uq32|y2uq32|5|A lot of people say we are going the way of Japan.   If you invested in stocks in Japan during their hay day you‚Äôd be flat over the last 30 years. If you instead decided to buy a nice house close to a major urban center and rented it out you would have accumulated 30 years of rental come and land appreciation.   If you bought ‚Äúvalue‚Äù housing outside the urban areas you would have lost your ass because you can buy said housing in random villages now for 30k because their population collapse combined with urbanization means no one left to live in said urban areas. Similar thing happening here. Covid was a temporary blip but it‚Äôs reversing to the old trend again.   so my belief is the only way to reliable accumulate wealth and retire with passive income in our lifetimes is rental housing by urban areas.

s558u4|y2uq32|y2uq32|4|I don't think the CPI number will be as important moving forward for the next couple of months.  Obviously today you might get a big move, but the reality of employment markets being too tight and likely to remain that way means that the Fed has to keep the pressure on...  Historically there's a huge lag between rate hikes and unemployment rising.  Can be as long as 2-3 years.  This is one of the steepest rate hike cycles in history so the lag will be less but I'd still be shocked if employment takes any serious hit before 2nd quarter 2023.  That means another 5-6 months of unemployment remaining around 3.5% and 200k+ job gains.  Fed has to keep pressure up next half year regardless of CPI because of how tight jobs markets are.|2022-10-13 06:39:29

Like what on earth is the bull case on companies like TSLA, COIN, F, WF, BAC, RIVN, LVS.   No one is buying expensive EVs at 8% interest when all goods cost 50% more than they did 2 years ago.   No one is dumping their HELOCs at the Vegas crap tables anymore.   The demand side destruction being wrought overseas is going to come home to roost. How are the Japanese or europoors gonna afford anything made in America?   But sure spy should end green today. WTF.|2022-10-13 10:16:36

s5grgt|y2uq32|y2uq32|8|Seperate from this sub betting on this shit like its a fucking casino with basically 0 knowledge of financial theory.   I just want to point out, the inflation reduction act, and any action taken by the Fed is not going to be immediately felt in the CPI numbers. The rate hikes hurt now, but by midyear 2023 I would bet you that we will be in amuch better place because of these actions. As of now the jobs markets are still strong, housing has to come down at some point but buying demand is still high as millenials age into needing a home for having children. The stock market is NOT representative of the economy at large, and has been detached from it for a long time, none of this matters unless you planned on retiring between this past summer and next summer. For the average Joe they will keep their retirement portfolios in their ETFs and have the same nest egg that was projected when they last met with the schmuck from Scwhab in the spring this time next year.|2022-10-13 08:19:09

Folks now realize their house is worth at most 75% of its Covid peak. Home equity line rate went up a lot. Now homeowners start cutting back on spending drastically.  Then something breaks.

s55ozh|y2uq32|y2uq32|7|CPI needs to come in well below.  If it is unchanged then that means the FED isn't doing their job.  Combine a flat or slightly cool CPI with the jobs data and you see that the inflation is much more anchored and sticky, and thus will require bigger hikes to controll.

Because it's the EU and American taxpayer that will continue to fund Ukraine no matter what. They're in too deep at this point, can't back away and lose face now.

s6olj1|y2uq32|y2uq32|3|Ok so conspiracy time (It would make sense but who knows if it‚Äôs happening). Banks have their earnings come out tomorrow, and they probably know they are going to look like shit. It‚Äôs also reasonable to think that if Bank A knows their profits look like shit, Bank B‚Äôs profits also probably look like shit. So the day before those are going to tank, when the market starts to rally you help it keep afloat, and then buy very cheap puts or shorts on the other banks. (I‚Äôll be honest don‚Äôt know insider trading rules because they don‚Äôt effect me, so could be way off on this)|2022-10-13 13:14:25
