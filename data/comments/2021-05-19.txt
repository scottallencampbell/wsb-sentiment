yqhmep|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|18|I'm getting real fucking sick of hearing the Fed say they'll keep the printer on until we're back to full employment. They act like they're at the helm of the real economy and not just market valuations. Their QE has only had a *marginal* influence on employment levels. The pandemic boosts, as well as what wages are available, plays a *much* larger role in whether people are in a rush to go back to work or not. If the unemployment rate is 6.1% now and it was 3.5% before the lockdown, we're already pretty close to normalizing. But after being stay-at-home parents for over a year, I'm not surprised working class people aren't in a rush to go back to their shitty jobs and then turn around and pay most of that for daycare. There are some moms who will never rejoin the workforce. We just aren't going to get back to pre-pandemic employment levels without both 1. UI extensions running their course and 2. a substantial increase in median wages... and that comes with inflation.|2021-05-19 14:43:53

[Probably](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gm-and-ford-find-new-bulls-who-sees-shares-rising-40-51621442418) Barrons text: > TÔøºwo analysts new to covering Ford Motor and General Motors are finding a lot to like about the traditional auto makers‚Äîso much in fact that they expect the stocks to gain about 40% from Wednesday‚Äôs trading prices.    Matt Portillo and Jeoffrey Lambujon, a team at the brokerage firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., point out different positives in the companies.    Portillo notes that General Motors (ticker: GM), for instance, has a ‚Äúpole position‚Äù in autonomous driving, an assessment that might surprise Tesla (TSLA) investors since the electric-vehicle pioneer has been a perceived leader in driverless technology. And Lambujon is impressed with Ford‚Äôs (F) turnaround.  Tudor Pickering rates the stocks Buy. The Ford price target is $17 a share. GM‚Äôs stands at $76. Both imply gains of about 40% from the prices they‚Äôre trading now.|2021-05-19 13:28:44

Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion per month.    Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.    Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.    Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.    Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.    Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.

You put on your parka, throw salt on the walk, and remind yourself that by summertime it will be warm outside. A successful stockpicker has the same relationship with a drop in the market as a Minnesotan has with freezing weather.

yphuf4|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|18|Being in GME is like joining a cult because the weird but kinda cute girl you're interested in is in it and says she can't sleep with you unless you're also a member. You attend meetings in some dude's basement that you're pretty sure is used for either ritual sacrifices or weird sex shit based on how it's dimly lit by candles and the iron handcuffs hanging from the ceilings. You roll your eyes every time the guy in the blood red cloak and hood talks about the rewards you'll receive in the afterlife if you just pledge your loyalty and donate your wealth to the cult. Your friends and family all make fun of you and call you a dumbass.   A couple months later, you don't know how things got so out of hand but you're being pressured by the entire cult to drink the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid with them so you can all ascend to the promised land. You decide fuck it, you already lost your life savings in OTM FD's and the rest went to the cult so you could keep banging the same chick, who's been passed around multiple other members, and you've been pretty depressed so what do you have to lose? You chug down your portion out of a plastic Chuck-e-Cheese mug and then die in agony.  Pitch black nothingness. All of a sudden you feel warm sunshine on your face and smell a fresh ocean breeze mixed with the scent of mom's cinnamon buns. You open your eyes and wake up in the muscular arms of the god Thor. He whispers into your ears, "It was all true, welcome to Valhalla." He leads you to your yacht where you find 100 big bosomed women, every single one the most gorgeous you've ever seen, and all desperate to snort your unlimited supply of cocaine off your massive 12" penis (you were only 3" before). And this is exactly what it feels like to own shares of GME.|2021-05-19 10:34:12

yp91b1|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|6|So this morning my wife woke up and said "dear, you need to do laundry I am out of underwear". I said I can't today.  My wife responded "why, what are you doing today".  And I said listen bitch I am busy trading (ok, i didn't really say that.  That is derogatory and misogynistic.)  I really said, honey I am busy making fun of people i don't know on the internet.  My wife responded "is it those retards from WSB that got you all caught up in gme?".  I said yes.  My wife said, "do you want your allowance this week?"  I said if it isn't a 1k it is no help to me.  My wife said, "do you really need 1k."  I responded, no I only need $50.  My wife said, "only $50 dollars?"  I responded, Yes, just $50 for an FD today.  My wife asked, "what is an FD?"  I said,  you know those people we make fun of who buy $50 worth of powerball tickets, weekly. Well, I am that person except access to a brokerage account. As my wife slid me $50 and patted me on the head, I said the laundry will be done when you get home from work. (but not in a cuck type of way but a sugarbaby type of way.)|2021-05-19 09:33:30

ypypi8|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|4|For those of you who don't understand the basic math of a   legitimate "Short Squeeze" --   Short Sellers sell shares to buyers at the highest available   Bid price because they have calculated that they can buy back those shares at a   lower price later.¬†    For some Short Sellers there is a careful process of   research, combing through financials, assessment of market direction,   price-history analysis etc. which gives them a strong conviction that the stock   that they are shorting will go down and they will make money by buying it back   for less than they sold it for.¬† For,   most, however, the approach is much more like a pack of hyenas following a herd   of elephants . . . they assume that at some point, the biggest will eventually   fall and make for a huge easy meal.   A Short Squeeze happens when the hyenas realize that the big   old elephant that they thought was going to be a feast turns out to only be   napping.¬† And as the elephant rises, the   hyenas have to make their escape.   The only problem is, for the Short Sellers to escape, they   have to buy back the shares that they sold at the current ASK price.¬† So as the stock rises, they are forced to   chase the Ask up and up.¬† The fewer   Sellers in the market place, the more desperate the Shorts are to make their   escape.   What we are seeing today is AMD's board saying, "We're   not dead, for sure."¬† And the hyenas   all know what that means . . . unless they are certain, they need to beat a   hasty retreat!|2021-05-19 12:30:39

yovmzn|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|2|Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.  Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape- descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital marketplaces are a pretty neat idea.  This planet has ‚Äì or rather had ‚Äì a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn‚Äôt the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.  And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, especially the ones involved in digital marketplaces.  Many were increasingly of the opinion that they‚Äôd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some suggested that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.|2021-05-19 07:53:42

yovwsn|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|-3|Every time I say I'm gonna fuck celebrity chicks even though I'm ugly, y'all keep downvoting me.  I see what's happening here. You're jealous of my confidence. You're not jealous of me fucking your favorite celebrity, because you think that would not, could not, and will not ever happen so it's nothing to be jealous of. As far as you can tell, it's delusional levels of pure confidence for me to believe that I can stop being unattractive and fuck Emma Watson or ScarJo, and *that* is what you're jealous of. You don't feel capable of deluding yourself into believing you could do that and you're butthurt that I get to go through life thinking of such possibilities as real while you have to sit there being like "aw man, Emma Watson sure would never have any reason to fuck me."   It's ironic, because I'm not even delusional, and if you can delude yourself into believing my confidence is delusional, then you could delude yourself into having the same confidence, except having the confidence would inherently make it less delusional cause being confident enough to treat a celebrity chick as an approachable human being will actually make some of them wet in and of itself.

yp7onq|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|-7|# You haven't earned anything and you haven't lost anything until you sell!!!!!!!!!! STRATEGY I firmly believe this. I'll repeat it: you haven't earned anything and you haven't lost anything until you sell.  Is your portfolio up by 100%? 200%? 300%? Great, but you see, you haven't earned anything at all, because you haven't sold anything.  Or is your portfolio down by x%? Well, I have a great news: for the same reason, you haven't lost anything, because you haven't sold.  As long as you don't lose your initial invested capital, it's fine. The only thing you would lose is a potential gain. Nothing more, nothing less. So, try to secure your initial capital and you'll be okay. You'll be much more calm and relaxed during these times.  At least, this is what works for me. In the end, this is just my philosophy. Feel free to insult me or whatever. Peace!|2021-05-19 09:23:54

ypyc9n|ng1nlz|ng1nlz|1|Good Morning,     Just wondering if any other E\*TRADE account holders with OTC accounts receive this email this morning?    New rules will affect your ability to buy and sell ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù securities, including at E\*TRADE        On September 28, 2021, new requirements take effect that will impact the market for‚Äîand value of‚Äîcertain ‚Äúover-the-counter (OTC) securities‚Äù you currently hold or have held in the past. The new rules apply to ‚ÄúPink No Information‚Äù OTC securities of companies that fail to publicly report and keep current financial and other company information and will restrict the ability of U.S. brokers, like E\*TRADE from making these products generally available.   \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  They sent a link to the Amendment that was adopted last September.  I have checked a few of the stocks I hold and only ONE has met this requirement in YEARS.  Most of them penny stocks I purchased in December 2020  after the September 2020 Amendment was adopted, and are still have negative return.    Not that today's market is not bad already, then to get this email.  All I can say, is WOW!|2021-05-19 12:28:10

In turn, it creates and delivers platforms for approximately 140 betting firms across 19 countries. Some of its licence agreements are with well-known names such as William Hill, Ladbrokes, and Warner Bros. PTEC has also grown rapidly through strategic acquisitions to diversify its offering.  Internet betting has become a key activity in recent times and PTEC has been well positioned to ride the wave and to benefit. It is believed that the size of the global gaming market will be worth close to $100bn in just three years‚Äô time. That would be close to a 40% increase compared to now.
