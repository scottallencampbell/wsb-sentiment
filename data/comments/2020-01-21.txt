f6viq0|ert4bk|ert4bk|5|Official Boeing announcement   As we have emphasized, the FAA and other global regulators will determine when the 737 MAX returns to service. However, in order to help our customers and suppliers plan their operations, we periodically provide them with our best estimate of when regulators will begin to authorize the ungrounding of the 737 MAX.  We are informing our customers and suppliers that we are currently estimating that the ungrounding of the 737 MAX will begin during mid-2020. This updated estimate is informed by our experience to date with the certification process. It is subject to our ongoing attempts to address known schedule risks and further developments that may arise in connection with the certification process. It also accounts for the rigorous scrutiny that regulatory authorities are rightly applying at every step of their review of the 737 MAX's flight control system and the Joint Operations Evaluation Board process which determines pilot training requirements.  Returning the MAX safely to service is our number one priority, and we are confident that will happen. We acknowledge and regret the continued difficulties that the grounding of the 737 MAX has presented to our customers, our regulators, our suppliers, and the flying public. We will provide additional information about our efforts to safely return the 737 MAX to service in connection with our quarterly financial disclosures next week.

I left some money on the table by watching for a bottom - I at least didn‚Äôt buy into an instant bull trap.   I think the Chinese flu and reporting record are sparking really bad memories, but health care improvements with a milder disease makes me think that‚Äôs an overreaction. A panic sell off on HSI and issues in HK... what else is new, and it‚Äôs the Chinese New Year.   Earnings season is on, not-QE is still on, the US market is the best place in all of the world‚Äôs markets to park money, and QQQ is the index with the most growth potential. I expect that while there will be ups and downs, macro risk is the only really big one right now.

I'd be ok with exercising one of the contracts to buy 100 shares at $15.  I want leverage to maximize my gains going forward, but I also have 7/17 19c and Jan '21 20c, and shares and I'm holding all of those for a while. Since the 15c are so ITM, the daily moves are getting exponentially smaller as it becomes more ITM, correct?  Is there a downside to exercising one of the 15c to buy 100 shares?  I think I read something about there being high fees on exercising?  Should I sell instead and use the proceeds to roll out to another OTM call?  Or sell and use the proceeds to buy shares?|2020-01-21 12:17:47

Bulls = commies  Bears = capitalists  You see, bears are like a cartoonish evil villain from an 80s movie that wants to destroy all the poorer neighborhoods around a prime piece of real estate, so that he can build a golf resort/theme park for rich people only. The bear wants to profit off others' misery and misfortune.  But bulls, they want things to prosper which in turn helps everyone in some form or fashion. Bulls are patriotic and proud, and believe in their country's greatness. Bulls want their fellow human to prosper alongside them, because we're stronger together.

f6vfr2|ert4bk|ert4bk|-3|I'm 14 and I have about 600$ of hard earned money. Contrary to must of you autist I have learned a lot about the stock market. (I know that it can go down and up and... that's abut it). So the question is should I buy Boeing puts? Every day they realize some bad news and the stock has been taking quit a beating recently. Also they admitted that this whole crisis is probably costing them 1 billion per month so I'm pretty sure that their Earnings report (coming out the 29th) is going to be shit.
