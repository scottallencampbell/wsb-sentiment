ti8jq9|s8ggqz|s8ggqz|3|IWM is pretty much showing why you pay attention to key levels; that IWM rejection at 209 today (top ticked at 208.98) is pretty much a perfect example of how important trading levels are.  It held 209 for 11 months, finally broke below that this past week.  Russell 2000/IWM usually sells off 25-30% in rate related situations.  It's down 17% right now (IWM at 202); so I'm still skeptical we're near the bottom though I think it's safe to say we're closer to the bottom than the top of this near term move.  My target for a while has been IWM of 180, but no idea whether we go all the way down there.|2022-01-20 14:39:27

ti9ize|s8ggqz|s8ggqz|7|The biggest problem that I see for markets right now: volume is way too low; there's nowhere near enough buyers/bidders on anything right now.  It's mostly just motivated sellers.  Every previous selloff the past 12-18 months has been a high volume dip; i.e. increasing volume into the bottom then massive buying out of the bottom.  That's the pattern for every pullback the past 12-18 months.  Not right now.  We're seeing a very different selloff right now: this is a lower volume, slow moving selloff.  Look at SPY: SPY's volume is 75 million right now; probably going to end around 85-90 million today.  For context: SPY volume easily hit 130-160 million at the bottom of previous selloffs.  That's when you see a real tug of war between buyers/sellers that hints at a bottom.  There's nothing like that right now.  A slow moving selloff is far more dangerous to dip buy than a fast moving one.  I'm just waiting for volume to come in; we need some high volume days where SPY goes up to 130-160 million volume.|2022-01-20 14:45:33

ti0a3i|s8ggqz|s8ggqz|4|In case anyone hasn‚Äôt figured it out by now..   Be careful playing options into the month before a quarterly rollover. Hedge funds/MM‚Äôs goal is to hit max pain more so then than ever, the month prior to the rollover  Because.. all the calls that go ITM tomorrow will have to be delivered and rolled into February.   Even if you hate apes/meme stocks/etc. this is why last year you saw the February explosion. There was an insane amount of calls that went ITM the month prior. But this applies to almost all stocks.   The amount of calls that went ITM for   January 22nd caused February 24th  April 23rd caused the May 25th run   July 16th caused August 23rd   October 22nd caused early November   Now pay attention to the dates listed first like January 21st of this year.

ti2q1o|s8ggqz|s8ggqz|2|PLTR is on sale guys. This is a hold forever stock. Like never sell it. Karp has subtly implied that when the machines begin purging the majority of the disgusting human quagmire only PLTR holders will be spared and only if they enter themselves as unstructured data into the machine.  BUT - it is a prime candidate for a short squeeze. They have two billion dollars in gold bullion buried throughout the United States South West in various national parks and if they do a share buy back, the shorts will have to cover their positions and whatever.. I don't really know what that means but it's alpha as fuck to say it.

People are single, and dating apps suck. Subscriptions are too costly and no one buys them.   Apple goes back to $90 in the next market crash. They never hit $200. They only keep throwing us new iPhones and no new inventions.  Sony stock reaches consistent all time highs, little did people know they also did biotech and came across a cure for a very common sickness.  Sofi never gets a bank charter, tanking the price to $6.   Ford goes back to $10  Netflix adds ads to their service, the stock tanks 30%.

thcr15|s8ggqz|s8ggqz|1|   Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (SPCE) went up 6.69%, second day 3.97% and then with week, all gain was lost. December 7 and today, lost 44%     Pinterest went up 5.52%, second and third day 2.27% and 4.76% and then with week, lost everything.   7 december and now, lost 19%     Plug Power went up 6.96%, few days later lost -15%.     December 7 and today, lost 37%   Just few examples. Nothing has changed, FED meeting still happening next week and earnings will be coming out.      And today NASDAQ even gained mostly because of Chinese stocks. China cut interest rate, all Chinese tech stocks went up like crazy, this pumped NASDAQ high, now everyone are thinking that now NASDAQ is going up. Lol, really?

Fucking bullish.   *In October, Google and U.S.-based crypto marketplace Bakkt joined forces to enable nearly 10 million Bakkt users to link their virtual Visa  (V) - Get Visa Inc. Class A Report debit cards with Google Pay and purchase goods and services online, using cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Once the Bakkt cards are linked to Google's payment services, cryptocurrencies will get converted into the government-backed fiat currency seamlessly whenever payments are made.
