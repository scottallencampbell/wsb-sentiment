ctc0in|pnzrg1|pnzrg1|51|Seriously what the fuck is going on? How can anyone say that the market isn't a complete farce? What are people buying? With what money? No one is producing anything, there are shortages in nearly every sector, there is a labor shortage further hurting supply side issues, prices for everything have skyrocketed over the last two years, and the fed printed 30% of all money ever printed over the last couple years.  And the fed just says everything is fine? Are you kidding me? Who are they fooling? Just waiting for their buddies to sell their positions for "ethics" reasons at the end of the month? This shit is insane. It's literally insane. 5.3% inflation YOY and what was it last year? Nearly the same. Absolutely insane. Real wages are not increasing at that rate, they never have. People have no money to keep up with this batshit insanity and there is goddamn nothing to buy anyway! How is this ok?  Anyway calls on SPY.|2021-09-14 07:57:50

cu4feo|pnzrg1|pnzrg1|22|IRNT players, y'all gotta be patient. Only 3 days left after today. As 9/17 approaches, the pressure to have 100 shares for each ITM contact will mount. As each hour passes, your odds of success go up in this play. Just chill. Expecting every little rise to be the squeeze will only set you up for disappointment for the day.   Just know that the high volatility on very little volume is strong evidence that the gamma ramp is in effect, so each spike and each dip should boost your confidence. Come Friday MMs will have to make an informed decision. And the highly likely decision is to satisfy the call contracts they foolishly wrote.  Edit: spelling|2021-09-14 11:20:48

cuuu7u|pnzrg1|pnzrg1|10|Archegos was just the beginning.    There is simply too much leverage in the economy.  The govt and FED are out of ammo if there is a black swan, because they've leverage the economy to the tits with huge deficit spending and lax monetary policy that leaves no more room.  Tons and tons and tons of businesses are now jacked to the tits w/ leverage by taking out tons of cheap loans.    Watch everything get blown up when we have a 1980s-1990s Japanese moment once interest rates have to get hiked and there is a contagion of toxic debt that no one has any ammo left to deal with it.  USA on track for a lost decade like Japan.  Youngins will learn what a true bear market is like when it lasts 10-20 years.|2021-09-14 14:16:16

cu1060|pnzrg1|pnzrg1|2|Another bad trade i made today was selling part of my MRNA contracts to buy GS. This was such a simple trade but i messed it up. The inflation data today was obviously less severe so investment banking stocks like GS will prob take a hit. My retarded brain saw the insane pump that GS was getting this morning and immediately ignored the fundamentals. Ended up using part of the MRNA money to buy GS contracts and proceeds to get butt fucked by their pump and dump.|2021-09-14 10:57:59

cts91z|pnzrg1|pnzrg1|-4|I truly don’t understand why people are against me on the tipping situation.  I used to be a waiter, I made well well above minimum wage to the point where I didn’t think it was justified for the work I did. Hell I made as much as some tech workers.  If waiters don’t make above a certain amount, they are compensated by their employer to get that wage limit (this has almost never been the case for people i know and work with in the industry).   I’m saying that you shouldn’t be obliged and EXPECTED to tip everywhere you go. If you get basic basic service like water, they dont really check up on you, not that she was mean or giving bad vibes, but it was a basic one or teo time service of coming by to give you water, nothing special. In those cases I think you shouldn’t be expected to tip.  I DO TIP everywhere right now because it’s frowned upon society if you don’t. IMO if the service is good, timely check ups, tone, attentive, caring, apologetic when mistakes were made by the kitchen, accommodation, that’s when I give a good tip.   You should not be expected in society to tip no matter what restaurant you go to. It’s just not a good norm. Take a look at asia, etc for example. They take pride in their food, adjust food pricing accordingly and waiters/waitresses are paid well. It’s a different story when these people are gettig paid 6 figure salaries doing a basic job.|2021-09-14 09:58:39

ctuy14|pnzrg1|pnzrg1|-11|The market will crash in the first half on 2023. The next year and a half will be increasing austerity on consumers. This will push people swimming in debt underwater, bankruptcy filings will skyrocket. All the money they've printed that was pumped into the market will be wiped out. Media will blame the poor, the term "sub prime" will be the buzzword of 2023 just like inflation has been for 2021.   Source: Predicted the 2020 crash in 2018.|2021-09-14 10:17:08

ctab0f|pnzrg1|pnzrg1|-1|So like... I enjoy shitposting just as much as the next guy, but isn't 5% inflation yearly bad? I believed jpow back when we compared numbers with the pandemic bottom in March 2020. But now we're comparing with August 2020, a very high point. And the numbers are still so fucking high.  In 5 years, if we keep 5% inflation, your shitty life savings of 10k is going to be worth less than 4k. Think about that holy shit|2021-09-14 07:42:52
