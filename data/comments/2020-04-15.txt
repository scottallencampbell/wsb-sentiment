Large money, REAL money is not buying shit right now. End of day, trump will open things open in certain places - market will go down and everyone will scream "good news = stonks down" but its not going to be the case. To be honest, anyone with any wits is going to see the economy opening as a terrible idea for the long run. We will all be back in the same place months from now.      Like easter - trump will likely soon scale this back and open up one small industry that means nothing.

We will see the decisions of the others soon but I would be surprised if anyone other than FL sees May 1 as realistic. Once this unfolds this week we will see what comes next.|2020-04-15 11:56:25

On monday we dipped a few percent and VIX was only up like 2-3% IIRC. Now its up over 13% on a 2.5% gap down in the SPY/SPX. Fear is back in the markets, big boys are buying a LOT of puts right now.

That is where we played around almost all day. Thought we were going to pull it out and close above but got corrected.

nh6rws|g1pvny|g1pvny|7|Boys I am going to write a longer DD on this. But you should look at buying $VIRT calls for 05/15 @ 30c or 25c. $VIRT is a market-maker, they make money off volatility. Their ER report is going to be absolutely insane and it will be released on 05/07.   I made a DD about this in March and gave April 17th as the date. That was mistimed because $VIRT needs a catalyst which will be the ER beat. I also didn't expect it to be apart of the larger equity sell-off.   $VIRT hit it's ATH at 37 in Q1 of 2018 when the VIX spiked and SPY fell hard. But that was after their ER report.  If $VIRT hit $37 in Q1 of 2018, then I think it could hit 40-45 after this ER from Q1 of 2020. The market has had probably the most volatility past few months in the history of the stock market. $VIRT makes money on that volatility. It is trading at $24 right now. I suggest getting 05/15 calls @ 30c, 25c, or maybe even 35c as a more fun bet.   TLDR: $VIRT is gonna sky rocket after ER on 05/07, so buy $VIRT calls for 05/15 @ 30c, 25c.|2020-04-15 08:10:26

Nobody knows, not even the experts. COVID is still a wildcard.   Every V recovery forecast is predicated on the presumption that there is no second wave. How the hell would anyone pretend to know that? They don't. Fact is ever more experts are expecting a second wave. Your V just went ∆. Who's modelled another round of shutdowns? Nobody.  And without a vaccine available and distributed a 2nd wave is not a probability to be dismissed outright.|2020-04-15 15:36:05

nhppkh|g1pvny|g1pvny|26|Hello, my name is Ernie and my grandson (William) sent me to this website.  He said it was a good place for help with the stock market.  I called my broker this morning because John who plays dominoes at the VFW told me that Boeing (the airplane company) and Disney (they have amusement parks) were trading very low and it would be a great time to buy!  It sounds crazy I know, William says buying stocks is called a "YOLO" (Bing says this means "you only live once" L-O-L!)  My stock broker (James at Fidelity at the Oklahoma City location, off of 4th St. near the new McDonalds) said that I had to update my "account security questions" and I dont know what that meant.  I am going to fax him some questions to use like "What is my favorite hole at the City Club".  But then James said I had to log into the "web portal" to change it.  Since my grandson (William) said this was a good place for finance advice could anyone help me understand how to log in to the "web portal"?     Edit:  I will be speaking with William's mother and making sure he does not continue viewing this discussion web site, it is very crass with some foul language and people do not seem very helpful|2020-04-15 11:04:57

nh11e2|g1pvny|g1pvny|6|Quick recap why GRIZZLY bear market is coming:  * US 10 year treasury bond is +0.43%. People moving money from stocks to the bonds. * VIX is up about 8% today. High volatility is back! * Gold is going down due to deflation caused by oil. -0.96% * Short term headwinds for stocks: SPY Optimism Index has reached 98, the highest level in almost a decade. When short term optimism was this high in the past, the S&P usually pulled back in the short term.  And tell me this. When was the last time that a bear market has ended with the highest optimism level? The answer is never, lol.|2020-04-15 06:57:44

LTRPA & LTRPB will fall in line to its true value of holdings in TRIP. One or the other will have to go down 35%+ to account for it. As an aside, there was a premium to TRIP from LTRPA & LTRPB of 15% that existed couple months ago, so this is the ceiling.  Edit: Premium existed to account for the voting control over TRIP.

nhfue9|g1pvny|g1pvny|3|Boys, I am telling you $VIRT is going to sky rocket after ER on 05/15. Today it is down because the rest of the market is down. But this means it is a perfect buying window. Get your 05/15 30c and 05/15 25c $VIRT calls now while they are cheap.   $VIRT is a market maker, they make money on volatility. Their Q1 performance is going to be absolutely insane. $VIRT hit it's ATH in Q1 2018 after a huge spike in the VIX and a drop in SPY. Q1 2018 is a cake walk in comparison to  the past few months.   I will be posting a longer DD this afternoon on this but you should get in now, while it is a good buying window.|2020-04-15 09:40:06

nhcojm|g1pvny|g1pvny|2|Volume drying up, resistance at 2760, RSI low on 15m. Could see a small breakout towards 2780 here, just shortly. Nice scalp opportunity. https://i.imgur.com/YFNqe6e.jpg   Edit: Still looking to break out but rejected despite closing over and 30 RSI on 15m https://i.imgur.com/G1N7WnV.jpg   If we don’t see a bounce here we’re gapping down to 2710 NOW.  Break below 2755 is a gap fill to 2710. Break above 2772 is a gap fill to 2785 test again. Enter your trades accordingly.  Here is the current channel I’m looking at https://i.imgur.com/wn3cK1P.jpg  Edit 2: to clarify. The gap fill to 2710 will not be instant. We still have support at bottom of channel (yellow) as well as price level 2750, and lower VWAP (white). With RSI touching 30, we will see a bounce to the upper range of the channel (yellow) or trendline (purple) before heading back down. https://i.imgur.com/dbGGtnI.jpg  In short, support causing bounce to 2760 or even 2775 before going back down to bottom of channel with resistance at 2750. I’ll be looking to enter my scalp at 2760 here and some more at 2765-2775.  Edit 3: Entered some puts at 2760. If we go to 2765-2775 I’ll buy more, if not I’ll be happy with my profits as I will sell some at 2750-2755 and sell rest at 2745-2740. https://i.imgur.com/j2E7NTq.jpg at which point I will pick up some calls to play the bounce back up.  Edit 4: This https://i.imgur.com/0HIgLyh.jpg  Edit 5: Sold partial puts at 2750. Still holding rest but will enter calls if we don’t get back in this wedge. If I do enter calls I will exit at 2760-2765.  Edit 6: Entered calls at 2755. Selling at 2760-2765. Will hold one more call on an off chance we retrace to 2775.  Edit 7: Sold calls at 2765 except for two. Still holding those partial puts from earlier that I will sell at 2760-2755.  Edit 8: Sold partial puts at 2762 for small loss but gain on other puts was larger so overall net profit on puts, net profit on calls, of which I’m still holding two, looking to sell at 2770-2775, then load up on more puts as it’ll be a steep drop once we start testing that 2770-2785 mark again as VWAP will be great resistance. Big rejection coming.  Edit 8: Still waiting to break out of trendline into 2770 to sell calls and load up on puts. Broke out as I was typing lol https://i.imgur.com/I5OZpB0.jpg  Edit 9: Sell orders for calls and buy orders for puts will execute at yellow line (upper channel) https://i.imgur.com/PJ2POPV.jpg  Edit 10: Like I said 😏 https://i.imgur.com/AwIrYB2.jpg —-> https://i.imgur.com/t2gNa0J.jpg  Edit 11: Line touched. Orders executed. Out of calls. In puts now. https://i.imgur.com/keN0SpY.jpg https://i.imgur.com/QN9qLMg.jpg   Targets: 2760, 2750, 2745, 2735.  Edit 12: https://i.imgur.com/BUOXF7Q.jpg first target reached.  Edit 13: First target broken https://i.imgur.com/m7P8PV9.jpg 2755-2750 next.  Edit 14: Approching 30 RSI on 15m. Maybe able to touch 2750 before a small technical bounce. Taking some profit at 2755 but still in most puts. Out of puts if we break out of 2760 https://i.imgur.com/nZyyQX1.jpg  Edit 15: 15m shows why 2755 is so important and why we go to 2750-2745 one we break below. https://i.imgur.com/xWLKn6X.jpg  Edit 16: Found support again. Out of puts if we touch 2764. Im still expecting rejection and for us to break below 2755 since RSI is back up to 37 and 5m is at 47. Should break below soon as bulls are running out of steam to hold it up.  Edit 17: Still in puts. Pretty big falling triangle forming. Sticking to original thesis. Moved stop loss to 2768.  Edit 18: top of triangle getting lower and lower. Will be ugly when we break 2755.  Edit 19: look at 15m, 5m, or even hourly. Then look at this https://i.imgur.com/IumEE01.jpg textbook falling triangle.  Edit 20: One last push I guess. Upper channel about to cross ~2763 level. Should see rejection here. https://i.imgur.com/uaty49U.jpg  Edit 21: RSI on 5m back above 50, upper channel crossed price level, VWAP about to hit 2775 within the hour 👀.  Edit 22: Stop loss hit. Sold half puts. Very bullish action breaking out there. We’re still technically in a falling triangle until we hit 2770 which is the second ‘peak’ of this falling triangle. If we break through that, upside is big until VWAP at ~2776.  Edit 23: Out at 2770. Next level of resistance is 2776 (VWAP) then 2780-2785 (50% fib retracement).  Edit 24: Rejected VWAP. Going back in my puts if we break below 2770 https://i.imgur.com/t7Q9Dbv.jpg bearish.  Edit 25: If we break below 2770, ~2763 will be decent resistance. Below that and we’re stuck in the 2763-2755 range again which would be bearish and make it easier to break 2755.  Edit 26: Break above VWAP (2776) and we go to 2782-2785 easily. If VWAP dips below 2775 (unlikely) it would be incredibly bearish and edit 25 will be taking effect.  Edit 27: In calls if VWAP starts trending higher (currently 2776.33 flat)  Edit 28: RSI on 5m approaching 70. Rising volume on this 5m candle to pump it over VWAP, if unsuccessful we will see a strong rejection.   In calls if the following conditions are met -	VWAP trending higher (currently 2776.33) -	5m close above VWAP   In puts if the following conditions are met -	5m close under VWAP -	VWAP trending down  Edit 29: as I was typing it broke and met the calls conditions fml 🤦. Getting ready to average down in puts from 2780-2785 now.  Edit 30: Averaging down in puts now.  Edit 31: in solid amount of puts now.  Targets: 2780, 2776-2775, 2770, 2765.  Edit 32: Bearish as we’ve rejected new upper channel and 50% fib retracement https://i.imgur.com/FG39Yc5.jpg  Edit 33: VWAP now starting to trend lower. Going to be a hard reject. Might see a small bounce at 2775 but overall going down.  Edit 34: Bottom of channel here. Could see bounce back to VWAP or even 2780. Still holding my puts. https://i.imgur.com/aFLIuNf.jpg  Edit 35: Should see an effort to go back in. Should fail, followed by dip to 2770 https://i.imgur.com/gKBCqNm.jpg  Edit 36: 2770 target here. Taking some profit.  Edit 37: Next target 2765. Facing a lot of resistance at 2770 but if we break below it’ll be a very easy gap fill to 2765, where I’ll sell most of my puts and only hold a few.  Edit 38: Something to look out for: we are currently making a head in a head and shoulders pattern. Bounce from 2760-2765 might seem bullish but that would make the last shoulder in order for us to break 2755.  In the event that it happens it will look something like this https://i.imgur.com/xHZONSD.jpg  Edit 39: Double top could form here. Would be very bearish if we do (Batman pattern lol). Still holding my puts. Stop loss at ~2786.  Edit 40: (jeez): https://i.imgur.com/7yN6NB1.jpg New channel formed with top at 2782. 2782-2785 is 50% fib retracement. The volume simply isn’t there for us to go any higher than 2785.  Edit 41: Another thing to look out for is the trendline (dotted white) that has acted as support and resistance (drew it on Tuesday) https://i.imgur.com/SBdAJtJ.jpg  Edit 42: Upper VWAP on SPY, 70 RSI approaching on 5m, 60 on 15m, volume drying up. Rejection here. https://i.imgur.com/Ohdh3AH.jpg  Edit 43: Not as much selling pressure as I would like. Still think rejection but if we break this then 2800-2820 could happen by EOD. My stop loss is a hair away from being touched. This test right here will tell us what the rest of the week will look like. Break this and we go back to test 2820-2850 like Tuesday. Fail and we test 2710 like Monday.  Edit 44: For tomorrow 2780 is the magic number. Close today above it, and we test 2800-2820 again tomorrow. Close below today and we test 2750-2710 tomorrow.  Edit 45: Took awhile but rejected. Need break below 2782 to confirm rejection. Moved my stop loss earlier to 2790 and it was just a hair shy of being triggered. Still possible for us to bounce off 2782 to retest 2790.  Edit 46: Stop reached. Out of my puts. Looking for entries now. If we go back to 2785 then I’m entering calls if selling volume looks dry. If we touch 70 RSI (62 on 15m and 67 on 5m now) and we still haven’t broken 2790 then I’m re entering puts.  Edit 47: RSI was super close to 70 while we were still ~2790. Got back into puts ~2787.5-2790. Got calls to hedge as well at ~2785. Will sell puts once we break 2780 and only keep calls. Will keep puts and sell calls if we retrace to 2785.  Edit 48: Bounce off VWAP to 2782.5 is possible. https://i.imgur.com/3iOqhjG.jpg  Edit 49: Out of my calls off of the retrace to 2785 as per edit 47.  Edit 50: If we bounce off 2782-2780 again then I’ll sell my puts too and just wait. This is super choppy RSI is balanced, price in the middle of VWAP and Upper bound, volume picking up yet no direction in particular. No clear picture here if we bounce off 2782-2780.  Edit 51: Cup and handle forming on 15m. This indicates very bullish direction here. Especially if we don’t break VWAP again at 2777. EOD rally looking likely if we don’t break dark blue right now https://i.imgur.com/xbsVQYi.jpg  Edit 52: Selling partial puts here at VWAP.  Edit 53: Out of all positions. Too much uncertainty here. Close above or below today at 2780 will tell us where we’re headed tomorrow.  Edit 54: A bounce at 2770 would be the creation of the last shoulder needed to fulfill the pattern. https://i.imgur.com/PwGMozy.jpg  Edit 55: If reached today. I will be buying puts at the top of this shoulder forming.  Edit 56: 2780 2780 2780. Below and we go to 2755-2710 tomorrow. Above and we go to 2800-2820 tomorrow.|2020-04-15 09:10:53
