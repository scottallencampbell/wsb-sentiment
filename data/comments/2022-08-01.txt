ijmezc|wddk5t|wddk5t|13|PSA: Please keep in mind that especially in times of fear, like right now, plenty of people on here will be promoting their own subreddits, discords, youtube channels, trading clubs and courses, etc by taking advantage of what fear does to people.   These people do not have your best interests in mind, and some of them will be very good marketers of their product. Because we're facing a potential recession, the format of that promotion will come in the form of shallow claims about how a recession is in, how "they" are manipulating you, lying to you, etc...  The first thing to check is if the person has something they're promoting. It's a red flag, but not by itself a sign of con artistry. Next, test the statements being made. If they're circular, contradictory upon being questioned, crafted to speak to a particular mindset that is reactionary, then there's a really good chance that you're being played even (especially) if the claim on the surface is emotionally reinforcing.  There are people on here actively doing this and some of them are good at just slipping in "hey, if you like this, come to my subreddit/discord" with crafted messaging which is against WSB rules. The mods understandably have to strike a balance with this in order to keep the sub fluid, but keep in mind that lots of people in here want to take advantage of your emotions and many are taking directional bets or selling contracts on top of that and reach on this sub is pretty high.  Be actively skeptical, especially right now.|2022-08-01 14:13:53

ijseci|wddk5t|wddk5t|6|I'm seeing lots of confusion lately about VIX spiking on green days. Volatility exists in both directions. The tactical belief that VIX only spikes down exists because of backward chart reading bias.  Directional downtrends increase overall volatility because sell-offs tend to be violent and short time frames with high upward volatility on short unwinding and cover during rallies.   When zooming out and reading the VIX chart, the trend overtakes the actual movement and makes it appear as if VIX spiking correlates ahead of downtrends when it's actually a reactive measure of overall market movement. That's why your VIX elevation signals on the daily aren't generating reliable sell/put signals during rallies.|2022-08-01 14:52:29

If anything, Chinese government officials are trying to draw up patriotic support by using Taiwan as a means to do it. China historically has bloody revolutions every time their people begin to suffer, and so I think all this Taiwan talk is Chinese Officials trying to rally the people to suffer for a “greater cause” to avoid being overthrown in case of economic hardship.

iihix3|wddk5t|wddk5t|2|Pelosi 100% determined to poke the bear regarding Taiwan. Latest from Chinese social media people expect her to attempt to land in Taiwan somewhere between tonight (US time) to tomorrow late morning. US sources were saying tomorrow night, who knows?  This is an extremely big deal to China and will 100% cause a reaction. Likely pushing BRICs closer to a formal alliance standing directly against NATO, and more economic warfare. Direct warfare between China and US still looking unlikely, unless US forces it. China's plan regarding US is to heighten and exacerbate existing potential rupture points, and let US degrade/collapse under its own weight. Heightening the trade war plays into that, at least short term. Xi has no desire for actual direct military engagement but would likely seek to cause proxy wars further overextending US military forces, who prefer direct involvement and more expensive material support for their proxy wars than China does.|2022-08-01 09:48:01

The stop -- the first for a US House speaker in 25 years -- is not currently on Pelosi's public itinerary and comes at a time when US-China relations are already at a low point.  The Taiwanese official added that she is expected to stay in Taiwan overnight. It is unclear when exactly Pelosi will land in Taipei.|2022-08-01 08:53:18

ii3l4p|wddk5t|wddk5t|1|The scary thing is if China wants to shoot down Pelosi there’s not much the US can do to stop them. She’ll be escorted by fighters (likely some right next to her transport plane and others many miles away maintaining stealth), fighters that would wreck China’s fighters. But, the US fighters almost certainly won’t be given authorization to shoot down Chinese planes until the very last possible moment. If the Chinese jets launch a few missiles her transport plane is gonna go down in flames, it won’t be able to dodge them. The Chinese fighters will then get shot down too, but the damage will have been done.|2022-08-01 08:02:14

All I can say is good luck but it's funny because if it did run similar then by Sept this year we would see TSLA around 1300 and when I went into the options chain there is steady OI correlated to this type of move, your best bet would have been grabbing a 1800c Jan23 in Jun for probably less than .80 at the time  if you felt this confident you would be up big with the recent movement this past two weeks.|2022-08-01 11:36:04
