6trwjn|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|8|Ugh. Can someone give me some sort of direction in this craziness. I've been too far out of the loop while my dad was in the hospital. He passed. Now the bills are stacked and his wife is being totally irresponsible with everything.   Last thing I did for him was tip him to $DIS 130c's back when it was 110. We started a successful business together and the wife took all the money that was supposed to be invested in it.    So basically I'm fucked. Went from having 15g play money to literally 30$ in my name. Had to put everything back into the business and I probably won't see any profit margin. Might clear 10,000 this whole year. 40,000 less than it should have been.   No sympathy. I have plans and I was doing pretty well for myself. Ive been back in for a few weeks and I'm just fucking clueless. I've never felt this way trading. Any tips would be extremely well appreciated by my family and I while we get our shit back together.|2019-11-07 13:00:56

6srbd4|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|5|Didn’t want to buy spy calls yesterday because we were too high. Lmao boy was I weong|2019-11-07 08:57:35
6sroyy|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|6|Okay brothers.  Still a mother fucking macro bear BUT, I have **closed** all short term put positions.    AMD 11/22 34's- out loss  SPY 11/8 & 11/15 305's and 303's--out loss  BBBY 11/15 12's--out loss  Also closed by one bull hedge 12/20 310c position on SPY---very nice return and been riding that for a few weeks.  Was not enough to cover the puts drainage however.  Still riding a decent size Jan 2020 SPY 300p position.|2019-11-07 09:00:11

6swzl9|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|7|Well boyz, I’m DONE with options. My 7.2k in puts was worth 4K this morning. I’ve officially lost 10k.   Going to get my capital losses tax deduction spread over the next three years and look forward.   Opened a Roth IRA today and transferred the max of 6k over, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while now. Any advice on what I should buy? Open to any advice. May wait for up to 6 months for a pullback to actually scoop stuff up.   May my bear brothers make it out of this fake and gay market alive   -A bear|2019-11-07 09:35:25

Stock is up 1% this morning so it seems like a good time to sell calls, plus Disney’s earnings release is tonight. I feel like if disney reports no significant news on Disney+ sign ups it won’t really impact Netflix stock, but if they surprise with big preorder numbers for a Disney+ and it gets all over the news,  that could hurt Netflix stock a little.

6tpxvh|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|2|So, FSLY, I know no one cares about this stock anymore, but there might be a play here....  Short interest was super high yesterday, which FSLY still seems to be feeling today.   With the short interest divided by daily average volume, it'll take about 3 days for shorts to covers. This starts the short squeeze.   I'm thinking this short squeeze starts tomorrow after earnings, or Monday.   Yesterday's short interest was 36.49; in the last 10 trading days, every day short interest was above 30, FSLY was red, and all the days it was under 30, FSLY was green.   I don't think we'll know what today's short interest is until tomorrow, but if it's under 30, I think there might be a play here to ride the short squeeze for 3 days.  Not buying calls for earnings, but I may enter into some ITM calls tomorrow at open depending on their earnings and if the short interest numbers come out early (I'm by no means an expert on this shit, but if anyone knows a better place to look up short interest and when that shit gets updated, let me know).|2019-11-07 12:48:29

If we are at the end of this cycle and about to enter a recession, they have to push it over $300 for a little while to trap longs before the next flush. Push it over $300 for awhile and get everyone comfortable and then dump it back to $180-$200. (a mild recession at only -35%)|2019-11-07 14:14:35

I could be wrong, but I'm nervous enough that I'd rather hold cash and watch folks gain 3-5% (index holding chumps, which I would be otherwise) then buy in at the moment.   Some smart china folks say China wants trump to win in 2020....But now that Biden is doing better in the polls, I really wonder about that. If warren was ahead, I think they may prefer Trump, but Biden is pro Beijing and is bought and paid for. I realize this is suuuuuuper simplistic, but I really wonder whether China is just dragging its heels till campaign season starts. My original thesis, which I didn't follow, had the trade war hitting maximum bullshit in January-March 2020.|2019-11-07 09:46:20

6tkm19|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|2|Just wanted to point out some unusual activity on $BMRN to anyone who hasn't seen [my post on this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsxsup/bmrn_unusual_options_activity_yesterday/) The TL;DR is that a $500k+ bet expiring on 11/15 was placed yesterday on a pharmaceutical company just 2 hrs before said company announced an important investor conference on 11/14.  There's more DD on the whole situation in that link. So far $BMRN is +1.28% today likely on just the news of that conference happening. There may be further upside just in the lead up to the 11/14 conference. Best case scenario is that the $500k bettor has more inside info that the expected drug results are actually good, and $BMRN pops after the conference.|2019-11-07 12:12:00

6tvmr7|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|-3|Hear me out - so many people are bullish on ATVI that the obvious play is the contrarian/inverse play for puts. However, the contrarian/inverse play is so obvious that I think calls are the play here. However the ultimate shocker here would be this stock continue to tank after today’s dip, which now makes me think again that puts are the play. However, I have calls and I’ve been killing it lately so the trend might continue so calls are the play, but also this can be the end of my streak and puts are the play and you are fucking retarded for reading all of this.|2019-11-07 13:24:29

6ulrh6|dsw7tk|dsw7tk|1|anyone know whats going on with CAT? they recently announced earnings, and missed revenue and net income. They also lowered full year guidance and fourth Q is expected to be flat, along with a decrease in production due to less demands from dealers. After all this, the stock is actually gaining really fast.  EDIT: they also laid off 120 workers.  EDIT 2: not to mention this is their 7th straight quarter of missing earnings. Each time, those "analyst" lowers the expectation for the following quarter. Only for CAT to miss again.|2019-11-07 16:10:33
