r7hr5p|rvrs79|rvrs79|5|I just looked at the patent awarded to AAPL for the seat with reclining mechanism:  >	Systems that implement automatic adjustment of the vehicle seat based on the identity of the passenger may gather and use data that is available from various sources to adjust the vehicle seat based on the preferences of the passenger. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, twitter ID's, home addresses, data or records relating to a user's health or level of fitness (e.g., vital signs measurements, medication information, exercise information), date of birth, or any other identifying or personal information. As one example, information describing a passenger may be collected and stored in a profile that can be accessed and used to determine seat settings according to a determination of the identity of the person that is sitting in the vehicle seat. As another example, the vehicle may include sensors that are used to control operation of the seat adjustment system, and these sensors may obtain information (e.g., still pictures or video images) that can be used to identify persons that are present in the vehicle or near the vehicle.   It is basically a smart seat that will memorize the contours of your butt cheeks and remember your fat ass so it can optimize comfort settings. I imagine each AAPL car will be able to locate a person if they are in a different car. This will some day evolve into absorbing fart molecules and advising how you can optimize your diet.

r8w2iw|rvrs79|rvrs79|2|The reasons to be bullish are, massive amounts of money in pockets, paychecks and accounts of American citizens. Every month, hundreds of millions, billions and billions of dollars get deposited into IRA and 401K accounts. That money must be put to work somewhere. That's it. All it is is new money chasing old money. And once in a while a wave of sellers greater than the moment of fund manager deposits hits the markets and we sell off a little.  The selling is not a f'ing mystery. The buying is not a f'ing mystery.  The whole world knows the US Fed is going to raise FFR all the way to .75%. WOW. Can banks afford to borrow at .875%? Can they pass  that on to the consumer? I wonder.  And how about Crowd Strike? Can they afford to borrow at two or three percent annual?  Go to your favorite porn site. Jerk off two or three times. Come back tomorrow. Money will be put to work and your rag shares will be worth more tomorrow than they were today.  Good luck fellow degenerates. I love ya. Really.  May God bless you, keep you and use you for His great glory. May you submit to His will and not get burned to shit in a lake of fire for being too much of an asshole.|2022-01-04 12:51:11

There is still a great opportunity to get into this true YOLO trade here in the mid $30s. Once the co. issues the all clear for AXS 05 the stock should move to $50 and never look back. We may wobble a little as we wait the FDA final approval of the blockbuster anxiety / depression drug. But when that does happen we'll near certainly launch to triple digits, up to $150 before the FDA review of the second drug, AXS 07, on April 30. And then go even higher from there.

r7e5ff|rvrs79|rvrs79|-7|Sharing some morning comments by UBS' Paul Donovan:  >Amateur virologists are likely to be prominent today, as the US reported over a million new COVID cases on Monday (the actual number will be higher). As the infected isolate, there will be fewer active workers in the economy—although inventories and changing working patterns will mitigate that. Demand is likely to be hit—quarantine limits consumers to online shopping, and in the absence of government help some incomes may suffer.   >   >UK data hinted at the effects of fear of the virus (when combined with an obsession about Christmas). The December BRC shop price index showed inflation, but only for food consumed at home (as consumers stayed in to avoid the risk of a Christmas quarantine). Non-food prices remain in deflation.   >   >German retail sales were stronger than expected in November and, of course, the previous month’s data was revised stronger. French consumer price inflation for December is expected to rise a little.   >   >The US ISM manufacturing sentiment survey is due. The general unreliability of surveys is made worse in the US by political polarisation generating biased responses. If the data were reliable delivery times might be a useful indication of demand trends. When demand surges, companies with weak pricing power delay deliveries rather than raise prices.|2022-01-04 06:21:07
