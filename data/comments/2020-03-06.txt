joktj9|febypd|febypd|14|So something interesting happened with that late move today. Unlike the previous big up days this week, VIX futures actually dropped correspondingly. Before what was happening is when we go up, VIX futures dropped a bit but when we went down, VIX futures spiked. This means people were super eager to buy the front 2 months futures at all times. As I was saying yesterday this also accounted for the huge overnight drop the last 2 days since VIX futures were bid so high (hence why VXX and TVIX started up like so high today at the open).   The fact that VIX futures dropped in a usual correlated way with the up move end of day is kinda good. It's still super high but it gives it a higher chance for a less volatile week next week and some stability.  It's also a slightly positive sign for bulls next week. The less demand for VIX futures, the better chance the market goes up. A lot of algos have ES, VIX futures, and the 10 year rate as 3 huge factors in how they trade since they are usually correlated.   Oh also my brothers friends dad got the cornavirus.....my brother isn't old enough to trade though.  They are probably gonna shut down his school which is kinda stupid imo but I guess they want to be safe.  But yea it was the first case in that state, so I think we can all pretty much agree every state will get it.|2020-03-06 15:22:47

jp30gt|febypd|febypd|21|Some great trading advice/quotes from well respected traders.  ‚ÄúThe less I cared about whether or not I was wrong, the clearer things became, making it much easier to move in and out of positions, cutting my losses short to make myself mentally available to take the next opportunity.‚Äù -Mark Douglas  ‚ÄúYou need to ‚Äòchange your thinking‚Äô. The goal is to reach a ‚Äòcare-free state of mind‚Äô.¬†When a pattern presents itself, don‚Äôt think. There‚Äôs nothing to think about. Take the trade because you have an edge. Then odds, probability and your risk control mechanisms will take care of everything. In the end, the key is to learn more about yourself. The most important lesson though is the importance of viewing every single trade as being part of a series of trades.‚Äù -Mark Douglas"  "In a narrow market when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range, there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be- up or down. The thing to do is watch the market, read the tape to determine the limits of the get-nowhere prices, and make up your mind that you will not take up interest until the price breaks through the limit in either direction."- Jesse Livermore  "When I put on a trade, all I expect is that something will happen."- Mark Douglas"Ninety-five percent of the trading errors you are likely to make‚Äîcausing the money to just evaporate before your eyes‚Äîwill stem from your attitudes about being wrong, losing money, missing out, and leaving money on the table. What I call the four primary trading fears."- Mark Douglas  "We need to¬†be rigid in our rules so that we gain a sense of self-trust that can, and will always, protect us in an¬†environment that has few, if any, boundaries. We need to be flexible in our expectations so we can¬†perceive, with the greatest degree of clarity and objectivity, what the market is communicating to us¬†from its perspective."- Mark Douglas"It always seems the best trades are the small ones you don't care about. In that case, make them all small to take your emotions out of the equation and let the power of the¬†trend¬†and whatever edge you use do its thing."  "When dealing with options, using stops take you out of the trade entirely. You never really know what the market will give you on any given day. If one assumes a 100% loss right from the start, and sizes their position appropriately, you can let the position expire painlessly but still have a position to take advantage of if something crazy happens within your option timeframe."  "Despite your best efforts, you never really know which edges are going to work and which aren't so stop trying to predict outcomes. By taking every edge, you increase your sample size of trades, which in turn gives whatever edge you are using ample opportunity to play itself out in your favor, just like the casinos."- Mark Douglas  "It is exactly like options, trial and error, not getting stuck, bifurcating when necessary but keeping a sense of broad freedom and opportunism. Trial and error is freedom.‚Äù- Nassim Taleb¬†¬†  "Markets are simple in that $1 in and $1 dollar out at end of day only generate trading volatility but does little to push prices higher. Markets need buyers who are willing to hold invesments overnight to sustain price moves. When these are absent, markets drop until levels are reached when these same buyers feel prices and conditions are attractive enough to hold investments longer term.  ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen much correlation between good trading and intelligence. Some outstanding traders are quite intelligent, but a few aren‚Äôt. Many outstanding intelligent people are horrible traders. Average intelligence is enough. Beyond that, emotional makeup is more important.‚Äù- Mark Douglas  ‚ÄúWhy do you think unsuccessful traders are obsessed with market analysis? They crave the sense of certainty that analysis appears to give them. Although few would admit it, the truth is that the typical trader wants to be right on every single trade. He is desperately trying to create certainty where it just doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù ‚Äì Mark Douglas  Tune out the intraday noise. Use end-of-day, week or month as a guage for the general sentiment of your stock within the timeframe you're playing.Randori is a term used in Japanese martial arts to describe free-style practice. The term literally means "chaos taking" or "grasping freedom," implying a freedom from the structured practice of kata. Randori may be contrasted with kata, as two potentially complementary types of training.  "The goal of the trader, paradoxically, is not to make money. The goal is to trade well."- Alexander Elder  If markets are "rigged" or not really doesn't matter. Making money consistently from what the market has to offer is what matters.  It's one thing to have an answer for everything. The creative have a question for everything.The market moves in waves that can last anywhere from weeks to months. Then a correction or setback starts, which can last anywhere from 5 to 8 weeks or even as long at 4 to 6 months.- Dan Zanger  History shows 3 out of 4¬†stocks move¬†in the same direction as the overall¬†market, either up or down. So if you buy¬†stocks¬†when the¬†market¬†is trending higher, you have a 75% chance of being right. But if you buy when the¬†market¬†is trending lower, you have a 75% chance of being wrong.- IBD  On average, every month has about 22 trading days. Based on the ebb and flow of market action, trending up/down, to range-bound, there will be 3-5 days great for trading with less risk, another 3-5 days great for trading with manageable risk. So based on this, one only needs to trade 5-7 days or 1/3 of all trading time in a month. Be patient.Sentiment Questions: Are dips being bought or sold? Are pops being bought or sold? Are the general market moves tight orderly or loose? Is the market making higher highs, lower lows or trading within a range?¬†How are ¬†the previous questions also playing out in other time frames?¬†The real challenge is to exploit the winning periods and limit the damage during the losing periods.- Peter BrandtHow do you know when you're in a bull market? -- whenever you get out, you must pay up to get back in- Peter Brandt¬†The 5 Fundamental Truths of Trading:  1. Anything can happen. 2. You don‚Äôt need to know what is going to happen next to make money. 3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of¬†variables that define an edge. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing¬†happening over another. 5. Every moment in the market is unique.The 7 Principles of Consistency: 6. I objectively identify my edges. 7. I predefine the risk of every trade. 8. I completely accept the risk or I am willing to let go of the trade. 9. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation. 10. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me. 11. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors. 12. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success¬†and, therefore, I never violate them.|2020-03-06 18:23:19

It's basically like the next 2 weeks are the entire market's earnings call and we're pricing in a 10-15% move on the whole market.|2020-03-06 13:25:12

job3h6|febypd|febypd|8|If you're having anxiety about prices looking cheap, just zoom out...  Things can still get cheaper, we're only 10% off all time highs.  Don't get anxious about missing out on prices we first hit in November 2019.  I don't think we retrace all the way back down to S&P 2000 or something like that, but a move down to S&P 2500-2700 seems reasonable given the massive uncertainty about coronavirus and the recessionary threat that it possesses.  The most important rule about trading is that there's always another trade.  Don't chase something or create FOMO in your mind or you'll make a mistake.|2020-03-06 13:50:01

jnk4l1|febypd|febypd|6|So basically the lower the bonds go the higher the flush in equities. All FED needs to do is to cut its fucking treasuries purchases and for that to reduce fucking repo. FED is in trap.  &#x200B;  If FED continues to buy treasuries at whatever raates to hedge their repo exposure they are accelerating the bonds rally and contributing to lowering rates what in fact increases the risk premiums of the stocks and overall perception of its riskiness. AMs and public funds are forced to sell high beta stocks and overall forced to decrease their exposure as per their mandates. Also add an increased volatility on top of that. High beta stocks are doomed to get fucked further.  &#x200B;  If FED decides to start selling off the treasuries they are accumulating risks on their books worth trillions of dollars or they have to reduce repo which they cant do as well as without liquidity banks wouldnt be able to borrow just like in October and this will lead to rally in overnight rates. Subsequently banks wouldnt have enough reserves as per mandates and would not comply with regulatory objectives. They will be forced to sell off their books to raise cash and get fucked.  &#x200B;  Morale: FED is in trap and god only knows how they gotta get the fuck out of this situation.   Its not coronavirus that drives these markets nuts its greed that resulted in inability of the financial system to react to external shocks.|2020-03-06 09:38:22

jn28l5|febypd|febypd|12|Key level is S&P 2855 (or SPY 285); that's the bottom from last week.  I'd assume that's where we'll see a real attempt to buy the dip like last week.  If we break south of that, all hell can break loose.  There's no real floor on the market until you get back to December 2018 levels around S&P 2500.  Markets are just looking so panicky right now; we're seeing a 100% chance now of a 0.50 rate cut in 2 weeks, and treasury markets look like a full-blown panic is setting in... just look at the 10 year.

jn46tq|febypd|febypd|11|Imagine entering a recession with rates at 1% and US budget deficit at $1 trillion+.  There's very little recession-fighting ammunition left guys.  That's partly why there's such a huge flight to treasuries imo.  There's little faith in the ability of policy makers to stop a recession right now.  Yes, markets can be pumped up in the short term through Fed action, but the Fed is powerless to actually stop the economic shocks that we're seeing now.  The only thing that can reverse this is if the US coronavirus outbreaks are brought under control quickly.  That's it.|2020-03-06 06:21:39

jn22c6|febypd|febypd|5|MGM Puts.  Nevada has now seen its first case of the beer virus.  As time goes on less and less people are going to be willing to sit in a crowded casino with a bunch of other potentially sick people.   US will begin mass distributing test kits within the next week or so.  This will significantly increase the reported number of cases that were previously played off to the common cold.  As that data slowly comes out more fear will cause market decline.  Im figuring we will see a sharp reduction in people booking trips to Vegas and far less people willing to go into a crowded casino during their main tourist season.  Edit: Forgot to mention, age 65+ makes up roughly 25% of the Vegas demographic each year based on one study; the age bracket most affected by the virus.|2020-03-06 05:43:45

Regardless of how this plays out the big winners(assuming we recover from this in a couple of months) are online stockbrockers like **TD Ameritrade** and **Charles Schwab**.

jo4kqh|febypd|febypd|4|A phenomenon frequently observed during liquidity crises is [flight to liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_to_liquidity) as investors exit illiquid investments and turn to secondary markets in pursuit of cash‚Äìlike or easily saleable assets. There are often large liquidity premia (in some cases as much as 10-15%) in [Treasury bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_bond) prices. An example of a flight to liquidity occurred during the [1998 Russian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis), when the price of Treasury bonds sharply rose relative to less liquid debt instruments. This resulted in widening of credit spreads and major losses at [Long-Term Capital Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management) and many other hedge funds.|2020-03-06 12:46:37

joejoq|febypd|febypd|3|Near record short positions on the S&P500.  You know what that means.  Will probably go lower (see example of record short vol bets and the following couple of months).  But afterwards, when support is found, these unwinding shorts will be rocket fuel for the multi-month rally that follows.  I would be much more afraid if this whole selloff up to now was organic fear selling from retail but since the selling is being exaggerated by institutional shorts it gives me confidence the bull market isn't dead.|2020-03-06 14:22:48

jofxwr|febypd|febypd|4|The IChing was right about spy not going below 290 today and now when I asked it if I should buy calls for the weekend it said    ‚ÄúYou are blessed with an opportunity to resuscitate that which others have abandoned as beyond repair. This ruin wasn't caused by evil intention, but by indifference to decay. Just by addressing yourself to the problem, you exhibit a new awareness, a fresh perspective. This is a time of recovery, renewal, regeneration.‚Äù  Recession over!|2020-03-06 14:36:02

jog9it|febypd|febypd|4|You look at charts during crashes in the past and it looks like everything just imploded on itself. Zoom in though and then you realize how long it took...  The 08 crash had 3 months after the top before the first correction, then another 6 months before the next drop, two more months to drop again and then it was a free fall after that.  Not saying this will be exactly like 08. Just saying it may be a bit before we see serious action. Especially if that foreign bank/eurodollar theory is true.

Think about how Monday will look when your puts are negative as shit because IV is gone and the market goes up.

jorp91|febypd|febypd|11|Hey man. Sorry for all the shitty people on here asking for your ban. Don‚Äôt listen to them, this is an exciting first step and we‚Äôre here to help! I‚Äôll do my best to try to break it down for you.  First, you need to find yourself a reputable broker. I suggest Robinhood. They have a great track record. Another good broker is Gatsby. Stay away from ThinkOrSwim/TastyTrade/ETrade.  Once you have your broker set up, it‚Äôs time to deposit your money. Pretty exciting stuff. You can deposit as little or as much as you want. The more you deposit the more you can potentially earn. When I started out I dumped everything I had in my account.  If you don‚Äôt have a lot, that‚Äôs okay! There‚Äôs this thing called margin. Your broker will literally give you risk free money to use. It‚Äôs a pretty sweet set up, all you have to do is check some extra boxes during sign up.  Now that you have your account funded it‚Äôs time to make that first big investment! Stocks, options, forex? The world is your oyster bud. But the best way to maximize your potential investment is to look at options, specifically calls. Look at the 5 Year chart for any major market following ETF, it goes up. So what you should do is look for calls that expire within a day or two and are well above the current price the specific stock is trading at. Why? They‚Äôre the cheapest so you can buy more calls and maximize those gains bud!  Feel free to DM me with more Questions.|2020-03-06 16:25:21

jnkmsi|febypd|febypd|4|A basic lesson in stock pumps for everyone if you‚Äôre curious about these pumps (government or large share holders)   Shareholders obviously have massive stakes in these companies. The same people also have tons of $$$  So let‚Äôs make this easy (small numbers), if you have   100x SPCE that you bought at $10.00  (obviously imagine this at a large scale)  Spce starts to crash, you‚Äôre stocks are losing value and your investment in that company is going to tank for the quarter (Cruise stocks). You can get a better investment elsewhere so you want to get money out. This is better quarterly return.   That share holders is currently down to $9.60 each for his shares.   He buys 15x SPCE which might spike a rally.  That rally brings up the stock price to $10.00 per say.   The shareholder then sells large quantities to minimize losses, rinse and repeat.   This eventually runs out of steam.|2020-03-06 09:43:21

jor0gw|febypd|febypd|5|Hey man. Sorry for all the shitty people on here asking for your ban. Don‚Äôt listen to them, this is an exciting first step and we‚Äôre here to help! I‚Äôll do my best to try to break it down for you.  First, you need to find yourself a reputable broker. I suggest Robinhood. They have a great track record. Another good broker is Gatsby. Stay away from ThinkOrSwim/TastyTrade/ETrade.  Once you have your broker set up, it‚Äôs time to deposit your money. Pretty exciting stuff. You can deposit as little or as much as you want. The more you deposit the more you can potentially earn. When I started out I dumped everything I had in my account.  If you don‚Äôt have a lot, that‚Äôs okay! There‚Äôs this thing called margin. Your broker will literally give you risk free money to use. It‚Äôs a pretty sweet set up, all you have to do is check some extra boxes during sign up.  Now that you have your account funded it‚Äôs time to make that first big investment! Stocks, options, forex? The world is your oyster bud. But the best way to maximize your potential investment is to look at options, specifically calls. Look at the 5 Year chart for any major market following ETF, it goes up. So what you should do is look for calls that expire within a day or two and are well above the current price the specific stock is trading at. Why? They‚Äôre the cheapest so you can buy more calls and maximize those gains bud!  Feel free to DM me with more Questions.|2020-03-06 16:19:03

joheek|febypd|febypd|3|Media was pushing the narrative that Americans are stupid. ‚Äú34% or Americans say that won‚Äôt drink corona because of virus‚Äù. Then we all assume society is stupid and doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming... except outrage is everywhere on the internet about this. That data was actually misreported and they later addressed it - after the fake shit already went viral. We assume a recession is going to hit because confirmation bias and we thought we were stupider than we are. Everyone knows about the virus. The number of cases of it existing doesn‚Äôt change just because we don‚Äôt test everyone - everyone is doing the numbers and trying to figure out what the real numbers are. It‚Äôs priced in. We take information we found out ourselves and have to spread the news and we do that by making things look bigger and scarier. Everyone is scared, but when everyone is scared, they‚Äôre predictable. And if you know the people‚Äôs next move, the big money people who could move the market take advantage. The recession may be coming, but it won‚Äôt come when everyone is expecting it (like right now).  TL;dr - we‚Äôre all getting played. Recession and panic is priced in.

Hey guys,  Rookie ass question but I would be lying if I wasn‚Äôt drooling at the screenshots I see on here of your guys redic gains. Can someone please guide a rookie/noob on how you guys are picking these stocks? Is it here? Do you here it somewhere? Or is there a website you guys can track what‚Äôs going up right now and then you research it and decide to buy it not? Thanks so much for any help. Can I pay anyone to share their stock picks? I want to get in on this corona virus money machine before it‚Äôs too late lol|2020-03-07 09:52:49

jp070z|febypd|febypd|-6|I may be complicating my trading too much so I need to ask what is the best way to tell which way a stock is going on the 1m chart?  I think I sorry certain shapes a few candles make and they seem to do the same thing more often than not. Also I've seen the cup and handle a couple times but didn't trade because I didn't know how well it'd work on the 1m. I'm a swing trader and don't like the market so I'm trying day trading.   I've been using the 9ema 20 SMA and 180 sma. That along with support and resistance lines intraday and from there overall stock movements. Things are kinda overwhelming.
