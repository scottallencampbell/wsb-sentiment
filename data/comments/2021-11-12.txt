kc3jnf|qs8s63|qs8s63|5|Elon is selling very slowly to benefit retail. He hates institutions and knows retail is on his side voting-wise. Rather than result in stagnation, this is creating a game theory situation (details inside) so expect a slow but increasing uptick in buying pressure over the next few weeks  The lists of catalysts next year are going to be huge. The insurance program being expanded, progress on full self driving, closer and closer to Dojo going online… The 4680, Berlin and Austin are ramping up at the same speed of Shanghai, the semi truck program launching in earnest... New mega pack factories in California and now Canada.  Wallstreet knows this. They know the company is worth more than it is now, the acceptance that test that is going to be the biggest company on earth within five years is gaining traction outside of the cult.   It may seem like a short period of time but it is completely possible that Elon sells his shares like a trickle out of a spigot over the next month. This does create a game theory scenario where, because the circumstances aren’t going to change and because there are many underweight spy tracking funds.  I expect a growing awareness that the status quo —that  elons share selling approach isn’t changing — will lead to slowly increasing buying pressure|2021-11-12 08:30:24
