2urtbx|tswdse|tswdse|6|I've heard some describe the market as lifeless. Coldly inorganic. They say its fluctuations seem robotic, random even. But I disagree. To me, the market is very human. That's probably because, despite the ever-growing presence of algos, it remains a reflection of human sentiment and human experience.  To me, no part of the market represents this better than VIX. It reminds me of the way I love my wife. For our mental and physical health, we spend most days with a low VIX. In fact, like UVXY and VXX (before it broke), we're perpetually at lower lows. Every year we've had together, we're more mellow. More settled into coexistence. It gets progressively easier. Less volatile.  But that doesn't mean we're never volatile. And it doesn't mean I don't cherish our volatile times. The volatility spikes come with the most significant moments in our relationship. Usually just before a big moment--when fear of the unknown is heightened--like the way VIX rises in the moments before Fed meeting minutes are released.  The first time we kissed. The first time we said "I love you." Every time we have suddenly, wordlessly fucked. Every time we have suddenly, wordfully screamed at each other in anger. When we decided to have a baby, and the violent, magical moment that baby arrived in the world. We were so filled with the terror of wondering if it would arrive with ten fingers and toes--if it would arrive alive. To date, that's the biggest volatility spike on our all time chart. But I don't pretend it will always be the biggest spike. In fact, I hope it's not.  Don't wish for all green days. Don't wish for a slow melt up. Let the market kiss you. Let it wordlessly fuck you. Let it scream at you in anger. Let it take the incredible risk of a near-death dip because that is the only way it will slingshot and birth the child of new, inconceivable wealth--new, inconceivable heights.  Let the market say "I love you."|2022-03-31 09:56:03

When the crisis becomes apparent we're going to get March 2020 again but without the fast recovery. Don't get me wrong, I will throw every dollar I have into that dip but until I see that dip I'm holding cash.

And any time the price goes down, it's the result of 'short ladder attacks' and 'manipulation resulting in halts'. The governing agencies of the SEC are also in on it"  but also  "The hedgies are defeatable if we can buy enough shares and DRS them, and we will eventually have $1,000,000 per share, because we can defeat the hedgies" even though they are playing within the system they say the hedgies are in control of and even the governing agency is not to be trusted.

2uadsl|tswdse|tswdse|2|MU will look interesting for tomorrow's opex if it holds around $79-80 today.  Solid open interest in the $80-90 range of calls  due to its earnings this week.  But it'd have to hold around $79-80 today for any potential gamma ramp to work tomorrow; there's very low open interest below $80.  I got a 10x on December's post-earnings gamma ramp (on Dec 23), but this setup looks a bit worse due to the post-earnings selloff yesterday.  Still, I think it's possible that we see a potential breakout tomorrow if it stabilizes close to $79-80 by today's close.  (No reason to jump into this early, just watch and wait imo).|2022-03-31 07:47:51

LEAVE Cathie ALONE!...Please.  Cramer talked about professionalism and said if Cathie was a professional she would've pulled it off no matter what.  Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional to publicly bash someone who is going through a hard time.  Leave Cathie Alone Please! Leave Cathie Wood alone! Right now! I mean it!

2u2l66|tswdse|tswdse|3|So let’s see here…looking back last 5 years, you typically have some sort of rally around February-ish followed by a smaller but rapid corrective drop shortly after. The big run up (apple going green 11 days in a row, for example) appears to have been broken.   We have 2 competing catalysts for today- Biden announcing we will be drilling US oil is a positive catalyst, while Ukraine surrender talks not going anywhere will hurt, especially chip makers who, for some weird reason, seem to trade in tandem with ukraine news more than anything, and violently so.   I think These 2 catalysts cancel each other out but the historical precedent of March retracement from February rallies means we will see a slight drop in the averages. When a small drop is expected, sell calls.|2022-03-31 06:33:53

She asks me what I want to watch on Netflix and I choose New Girl. I sit on her bed and put my arm around her. She seems eager to have sex. We make out and take off our clothes. She asks me if I’m okay because I’m shaking. I don’t find her very attractive. She also smells bad. I finger her vagina and she calls me daddy. She tries to give me a handjob, but it doesn’t work very well. I ask for a blowjob and she declines. I rub my penis on her leg and ejaculate. I decide not to insert both because she’s unattractive and because she didn’t say anything about a condom. We get dressed and cuddle for a little while. Return.|2022-03-31 07:23:05

2u5z34|tswdse|tswdse|-1|Alright so after many requests from my fans here is my pork rib bites recipe:  I used between 4-5lbs boneless pork ribs cut into bite size pieces.  Seasoning: 1tsp onion powder 1tsp garlic powder 1/2tsp smoke paprika 1/2tsp chili powder 2TBSP Italian seasoning Salt and pepper to taste *** 2TBSP Baking Powder ***  Toss in bowl to get seasoning mixed well on pork. Air fry that shit. (Mine took about 25-30 minutes in my ovens air fryer on a wire rack. Put rack on a cookie sheet to catch grease. May take more/less time depending on size of bites.) should be getting darker and crispy on outside when done.  /u/spreadtrader /u/tonyaustin6|2022-03-31 07:08:13

2vf1th|tswdse|tswdse|-9|Something I discovered recently and is 100% real. Eating a girl's ass who has attended a music festival, preferably a all day long festival in the middle of heatwave, is by far the most enjoyable experience. First, the heat and humidity provide a hot, sticky, and succulent environment for the asshole and crack. Second, she's obviously been outdoors all day using port a potties with cheap toilet paper, so wiping isn't nearly as good as like home. Cheap paper will leave behind remnants and residue. The heat and humidity liquifies the remnants and mixes with her pussy discharge, and it creates a most succulent, delicious, and scrumptious asshole flavor. Third, all of the constant dancing and the heat trapped in her crack from being underneath underwear and tight shorts just add to the flavor. I would literally eat ass like this on a daily fucking basis.|2022-03-31 12:24:35

If I am Russia, I rather flare off my gas than get paid in EURs right now. What will happen is the biggest scramble for oil you have ever seen as european utilities scramble for any oil barrel below $200 to power their dual fuel generators previously running on NG. Given their NG equivalent is already $200/barrel.  $200 oil in the next month is not a ceiling, it is a floor.|2022-03-31 10:16:35
