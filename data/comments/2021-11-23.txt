lrawn5|r0asp7|r0asp7|41|Around 1 year ago today I started to YOLO all my accounts, as in risk trade 90%+ of my net worth (per account) on trades. And over the course of the next 1.5 month leading to 2021 I went from 15k worth to 185k worth.  I then lost about 95k+ in less than a week the last week of January and from then on for the next 10 months I made sure my risk tolerance exposure was absolutely minimal.   That was until last Thursday I yolo'd one of my entire accounts on a 1dte and made 320% overnight. And all I thought about over the weekend was why I even stopped yoloing.   So yesterday I threw that same account into a new weekly this week. And I am proud to say I now fully remember why I stopped the yolo's... and how it feels again. the position today will be -90% come market open. Wish me luck boys.|2021-11-23 05:54:52

lrzuvf|r0asp7|r0asp7|7|Posted this last night but wanted more opinions. Memes aside is TSLA at its peak? It‚Äôs valued at 1.1T which very few companies are even close to. It now has real competition because congress has included billions of dollars for charging stations in their bill and companies like Ford and GM seem to be capitalizing on this to introduce their own electric vehicle lineup. TSLA also has a pending lawsuit which isn‚Äôt very large in terms of their valuation right now but could make mutual funds wary to invest in the future. On top of this you have Elon battling congress by selling his own shares to the company in massive amounts. All the while this information appears to have not affected the stock price at all. My drunken reasoning behind this makes me feel as if TSLA share price is ready to drop but hasn‚Äôt yet, also I‚Äôm wary with watching GME that the people investing in the meme stocks will forever refuse to sell and keep the price propped up for a while.|2021-11-23 09:32:13

It slams the breaks at every intersection causing people to almost crash into it from behind. It flashes high beams at every car it passes. It loves to take blind 90 degree turns then stop in the middle of the road so you almost get T-boned. It's a total disaster and the only reason there aren't dozens of deaths is Tesla Stans know that turning it on = instant death, so they never turn it on. I am convinced its actual purpose is as some sort of CIA assassination program where they will program the car to crash itself and kill the driver or whatever target they want.

Who says martingale doesn‚Äôt work?

lsxtuk|r0asp7|r0asp7|-4|Before Lucid's tech the E-Racing scene did only half the race on a battery. Now they do full races on a battery. Every single car at that top level uses Lucid. You guys forget Lucid did powertrains and battery setups before they decided to make cars.   Their first vehicle? 2021 Motortrend car of the year. And their CEO said their end game isnt just luxury vehicles forever, they want everyone on the planet driving an EV. They already are working on an SUV and a more affordable vehicle as well ($25,000 ev)   The last earnings report didnt have their current deliveries but said we are looking at about 17,000 already. That's 1.7 billion dollars right out of the gate. They are expected to ramp up production year after year and in a couple years that goal is to ram up to 400,000 to half a million a year. Their giga factory is already built and producing cars as we speak. They have delivered cars to customers. All your doubts should have been crushed right then and there.  Did I mention they have around 5 billion in cash to play with already?   And the most important part, tech. Luxid were the first and only EV company to break the 500 mile range barrier on a single charge. That's 100 miles more than Tesla even (and Lucid's claims are actually third party and epa verified) Your boomer car companies, some who gad a ten year start over everyone are planning what? 200 to 300 mile range clunkers coming out in 5 years? You can look at stat comparison's and Lucid is blowing away the competition.  Another thing, a lot of car companies get all their parts from a bunch of other companies. Lucid does mostly it all in house with their own tech. Hell, Lucid might be doing the powertrains for your favorite boomer company lol  The shift worldwide to EVs is obvious too.   Like Tesla, the sales are direct to consumers. I can walk into a Ford dealership and leave it buying a Honda.    Simply put,this aint Nikola.|2021-11-23 13:14:23

Even just on the topic of covid alone I can think of further examples, including just as strong of examples, but no counterexamples.   From your perspective reading this, it could hypothetically be selection bias, but I'm confident I remember times when I'm wrong, they stick out in my memory like a sore thumb, so from my perspective it's pretty reasonable to be confident it's not selection bias.
