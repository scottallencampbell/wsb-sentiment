It’s all a bunch of people making up random names for TA patterns.  “Classic double dong drop, seen it before. Buying puts.”  “[insert stock here] can’t hold the trailing trebek average, shorting now”  “The MACD just diverged from the Tropic of Capricorn”  That’s how it reads to me. Like how is it any different then astrology girls? Saying the stock will drop because it dead cat bounced is just like saying your personality is predicted by the month you were born in.

u5umyz|scb4z5|scb4z5|4|Complete consensus everywhere I look that we reached capitulation yesterday and that a red open is good, we should retest yesterday's lows and that January selloffs are always sharp and brief. There is no way we've touched bottom. This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better but should be over sometime in the next couple of weeks.  So many people simply do not understand that true capitulation isn't something people spot, laugh about and buy the bottom. They capitulate too. Everyone does because real panic takes hold. People always assume everyone else is irrational right up to the moment they give in to it too.|2022-01-25 09:24:50

Your competition is International Math Olympiad Gold Medalists quants at DE shaw who are pricing in the effect of variations in the earth's rotation on corn futures.     Just boomer it up and focus on improving your income.

If rates rise to control inflation, debt burdens can skyrocket out of control.  Yet if the fed doesn't control inflation, then inflation will ravage the economy.  Stupid fucks leveraged the shit out of their businesses and the country.  Now the piper must be paid.  Wait until 2022 turns into a historic debt crisis contagion that roils the global economy and sets off a massive recession.  USG has gotta get the national debt under control.  This is exactly why its so fucking stupid to carry this much debt. And we have a lotta idiots in the govt who believe in insane shit like Modern Monetary Theory.|2022-01-25 07:27:36

The fact that there is no Fed put this time is what's roiling the market.  The Fed must focus on price stability and has tons of room for being hawkish now that full employment has been reached.  The stock market has had 10+ years of a historic bull run. It was built on over a decade of cheap easy money, fast liquidity, and low interest rates.  That era is ending.  It's literally an asset bubble that's been inflated for 10 years, which is why the drawdown is going to be so painful when the easy money ends.

u6vhz3|scb4z5|scb4z5|6|Dude on CNBC said earlier that if a great stock like Apple goes down the fed will know something is seriously wrong and will come in to help.  So now the fed is picking and choosing which stocks are sound investments and using that to guide policy. And people actually believe this will happen. And doubly believe that the fed can directly control stocks. I must be taking crazy pills. JPow ain't gonna say shit tomorrow that's any different than what he's been saying since November. Just because people long stocks want to pretend inflation will magically disappear doesn't mean it's going to happen.  At this point the fed has to be more worried about the inflation narrative than the stock market and if they pivot again they'll lose any credibility they had. Not gonna happen|2022-01-25 13:15:04

Bear thesis  Could dilute (I’d need to read the SPAC terms). Could suffer from tightening pocket books if stagflation goes wild.   The financials on this look strong though.  I still need to look at the PE the competition though and what CAGR they are returning compared to bark and debt profiles.  10q https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001819574/d1cd5723-f976-4f65-a9a9-c2aa7bd9ac5c.pdf|2022-01-25 14:24:24

u6cyul|scb4z5|scb4z5|6|Yo apes- WTF? Your enemy is now your buddy?  > Bloomberg. January 25, 2022.   File this one under, "if you can't beat them, join them".  Ken Griffin, CEO of market maker Citadel, speaking at the Gotham Investment conference today revealed that his firm has taken a significant stake in Gamestop (GME) call options.  Gamestop became famous almost a year ago when hedge funds, like Griffin's Citadel, shorted the video game retailer to over 100% of available stock.  The short position created a quick squeeze and Citadel, along with partners like Melvin Capital, lost massively on the price movement.  Since January of 2021, Griffin says that Citadel has been buying call options on Gamestop.  Call options are an investment strategy where buyers are wagering on 100 share blocks to increase to a certain value over time and the buyer has the "option" to buy the stock at that determined price or sell that option for a profit.  Griffin said that he was upset by the loss last year but that he is in this business to generate value for his clients- sometimes that means joining your former foe.  Griffin did not reveal the values of his calls options on Gamestop but he did say he remains bullish on the stock despite the current economic downturn.|2022-01-25 11:20:43

u77inj|scb4z5|scb4z5|0|So I've been saying for a bit now that they would never drop the market when it was to obvious so retail could make money or jump put before the margin calls in mass.  I also frequently wonder why each of these red days why everyone forgets they send in the rescue team to stop the market from dropping too low, as if they turned their brain off.  You could take all the posts earlier today, apply them to even last week and you couldn't tell the difference, same level of panic.  Once again the Rescue Team has lifted us up to near green AGAIN. There is still time to hit green like yesterday. Even if not we aren't at the low from earlier.  I don't know how you guys keep forgetting about the Rescue Team after them showing up 5 trading days in a row.|2022-01-25 14:29:58

However, as the day wore on and Microsoft began its comeback, sentiment in the options market quickly changed.   >   >“We did see calls outpacing puts by \[a ratio of\] about 3-to-2,” Optimize Advisors CIO Michael Khouw said Monday on CNBC’s “Fast Money.”   >   >“The four most active options were all weekly calls. The most active of those were the Jan. 28 weekly 300-calls. We saw over 27,000 of those trading for $4.84 \[in premium\]. Buyers of those calls are risking just over 1.6% of the closing stock price to bet that the stock will finish higher after they report earnings,” Khouw said.   >   >Those call contracts, which expire this coming Friday, have a break-even underlying stock price of $304.84. That’s just about 3% higher than where Microsoft closed Monday’s session, or half of the magnitude of the stock’s implied move between now and Friday’s close.   >   >Not only did call contracts eventually outpace the trading volume of put contracts in Microsoft during Monday’s session, but calls made up all of the top four most active contracts in the name by the time the closing bell rang.  Monday, there were more puts than calls. Now there are more calls than puts. Hmmmm|2022-01-25 13:41:19

u6zsuv|scb4z5|scb4z5|-5|- What a surprise, - says Bill Gates, greeting an unexpected guest , - what do I owe?  - I just decided to check on my boy, - Tim Apple replied, smiling. - I saw your stonk. I'm really sorry about what happened.  - Come on, it's fine, - Bill said listlessly, but everything Tim saw said the opposite: a faded look, a strained smile, slightly shaking hands.  - I know how you feel. - You need a distraction. Tim came a little closer - Do you want to watch a movie? Or we could just sit in silence.  - Are you alright? - Bill jokingly put his hand on Tim' forehead. - Why is Sir so caring?  Tim grinned.  - Enjoy it while I'm kind - he sat down on the sofa like it was his house and patted the empty seat, inviting Bill.  - Well, I don’t deserved it but t's not every day that I miss earnings and give no guidance...|2022-01-25 13:42:02

Market participants want certainty, and Powell will give that. However, the market will not recover entirely to its previous highs, I'm thinking we retest the 460s before the VIX picks up again. Dip buyers will show up and attempt a V shape, but the defining point will be when we get back to 460s.
