u5ilu8|scb4z5|scb4z5|11|Cramer is just so completely irresponsible most of the time.  He knows that smart money is selling on valuation concerns yet he keeps going on and on and on about how "if you were willing to pay $320 a share in late 2021 why won't you pay $290 now?"  You can always buy during a bubble-like uptrend and hope to sell to somebody else, now's the wrong time to take that approach.  Have to look at P/E and P/S now and make sure that they make reasonable sense for the next 12 months; he knows that but he plays the circusmaster on TV.|2022-01-25 07:58:53

u5dp2e|scb4z5|scb4z5|10|Full employment has arguably been reached.  The market *wants to hear* that the Fed will step in to support the market, but they aren't going to get it this time.  The fact that there is no Fed put this time is what's roiling the market.  The Fed must focus on price stability and has tons of room for being hawkish now that full employment has been reached.  The stock market has had 10+ years of a historic bull run. It was built on over a decade of cheap easy money, fast liquidity, and low interest rates.  That era is ending.  It's literally an asset bubble that's been inflated for 10 years, which is why the drawdown is going to be so painful when the easy money ends.  We will be back to the days of when 5-7% portfolio returns are 'good'.|2022-01-25 07:18:46

Just because people long stocks want to pretend inflation will magically disappear doesn't mean it's going to happen.

u6cyul|scb4z5|scb4z5|6|Yo apes- WTF? Your enemy is now your buddy?  > Bloomberg. January 25, 2022.   File this one under, "if you can't beat them, join them".  Ken Griffin, CEO of market maker Citadel, speaking at the Gotham Investment conference today revealed that his firm has taken a significant stake in Gamestop (GME) call options.  Gamestop became famous almost a year ago when hedge funds, like Griffin's Citadel, shorted the video game retailer to over 100% of available stock.  The short position created a quick squeeze and Citadel, along with partners like Melvin Capital, lost massively on the price movement.  Since January of 2021, Griffin says that Citadel has been buying call options on Gamestop.  Call options are an investment strategy where buyers are wagering on 100 share blocks to increase to a certain value over time and the buyer has the "option" to buy the stock at that determined price or sell that option for a profit.  Griffin said that he was upset by the loss last year but that he is in this business to generate value for his clients- sometimes that means joining your former foe.  Griffin did not reveal the values of his calls options on Gamestop but he did say he remains bullish on the stock despite the current economic downturn.|2022-01-25 11:20:43

u77inj|scb4z5|scb4z5|0|So I've been saying for a bit now that they would never drop the market when it was to obvious so retail could make money or jump put before the margin calls in mass.  I also frequently wonder why each of these red days why everyone forgets they send in the rescue team to stop the market from dropping too low, as if they turned their brain off.  You could take all the posts earlier today, apply them to even last week and you couldn't tell the difference, same level of panic.  Once again the Rescue Team has lifted us up to near green AGAIN. There is still time to hit green like yesterday. Even if not we aren't at the low from earlier.

However, as the day wore on and Microsoft began its comeback, sentiment in the options market quickly changed.   >   >‚ÄúWe did see calls outpacing puts by \[a ratio of\] about 3-to-2,‚Äù Optimize Advisors CIO Michael Khouw said Monday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúFast Money.‚Äù   >   >‚ÄúThe four most active options were all weekly calls. The most active of those were the Jan. 28 weekly 300-calls. We saw over 27,000 of those trading for $4.84 \[in premium\]. Buyers of those calls are risking just over 1.6% of the closing stock price to bet that the stock will finish higher after they report earnings,‚Äù Khouw said.   >   >Those call contracts, which expire this coming Friday, have a break-even underlying stock price of $304.84. That‚Äôs just about 3% higher than where Microsoft closed Monday‚Äôs session, or half of the magnitude of the stock‚Äôs implied move between now and Friday‚Äôs close.   >   >Not only did call contracts eventually outpace the trading volume of put contracts in Microsoft during Monday‚Äôs session, but calls made up all of the top four most active contracts in the name by the time the closing bell rang.

I'm really sorry about what happened.  - Come on, it's fine, - Bill said listlessly, but everything Tim saw said the opposite: a faded look, a strained smile, slightly shaking hands.  - I know how you feel. - You need a distraction. Tim came a little closer - Do you want to watch a movie? Or we could just sit in silence.  - Are you alright? - Bill jokingly put his hand on Tim' forehead. - Why is Sir so caring?  Tim grinned.  - Enjoy it while I'm kind - he sat down on the sofa like it was his house and patted the empty seat, inviting Bill.  - Well, I don‚Äôt deserved it but t's not every day that I miss earnings and give no guidance...|2022-01-25 13:42:02

Dip buyers will show up and attempt a V shape, but the defining point will be when we get back to 460s.
