Lower demand for luxury rentals has to push prices down; the owners in many cases can't afford to let things go vacant for *too long,* as they likely have steep mortgages to pay off on the units.  I'm talking largely about all the AirBnB rentals that would normally be outside your price range.  Maybe give it some time.  But I'm thinking about Colorado in late September.  :D|2019-08-28 09:32:57

ycr6wc|cwj9cz|cwj9cz|3|Heres some info i gathered for the folks that are so heavily invested/has interest in FSLY. Disclaimer; i hold no positions. This requires some IT knowledge to understand. So my friend use to work as a TAM (technical account manager) for FSLY. Here is a direct quote from his time working there. I changed nothing:  &#x200B;  >They are Varnish based on SSDs, engineered for speed, fast deployments, and devops friendly.     >   >   >   >They monitor cache evictions and can figure out how to optimize cache retention based on that, by adding more local storage easily.     >   >   >   >Their clusters have nodes that talk to each other, to optimize space, no need for duplicate copies, maximizing space efficiency, while maintaining speed.     >   >   >   >They colocate in the best data-centers, by airports, to ensure the best bandwidth and network.     >   >   >   >They excel the most in front line customer support and online documentation.  All of their front line is highly trained, good natured, usually have good load balancing backgrounds.  Internally, they have a developed training regimen.     This still doesnt sway my decision when i say they're doing nothing different from the major competitors. So take away what you will from that info|2019-08-28 10:23:13

ycwdg8|cwj9cz|cwj9cz|7|This is a confirmation of ideas that I've been posting about for awhile.  The writing is on the wall re:  The Trade War.  China isn't going to cave - instead they're just going to work around us.  >China is preparing for a battle that could be as long as the U.S.-Japan trade war in the 1980s that lasted more than a decade, according to Yi Xiong, China economist at Deutsche Bank.   >   >“We think China is neither aiming to quickly reach a trade deal, nor trying to hit back at the U.S. as hard as it can,” Xiong said in a note on Wednesday. “China’s current strategy likely has a long time horizon embedded in it. The time horizon may also go beyond the life cycle of the current U.S. administration.”   >   >While China will remain open to further negotiations, it’s less likely to make concessions given its effort to diversify its supply chain, the economist said.   >   >China is accelerating efforts in other countries to reduce its reliance on the U.S. The official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party People’s Daily on Sunday published several articles about China’s improving cooperation with other countries including Thailand, Japan, Korea and Latin America.   >   >The country is also strengthening its domestic market. The State Council on Tuesday outlined 20 measures to support consumption, including applying new technologies to promote the circulation of products, improving infrastructure of commercial streets and accelerating the development of chain convenience stores, according to state-run media Xinhua.  ...  There's also this:   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt\_and\_Road\_Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative)  >The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government involving infrastructure development and investments in 152 countries and international organizations in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas.\[1\]\[2\] "Belt" refers to the overland routes for road and rail transportation, called "the Silk Road Economic Belt"; whereas "road" refers to the sea routes, or the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.\[3\]   >   >The Chinese government calls the initiative "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future".\[7\] Some observers see it as a push for Chinese dominance in global affairs with a China-centered trading network.\[8\]\[9\] The project has a targeted completion date of 2049,\[10\] which coincides with the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.  China is making huge moves.  Of course, we've neutered the State Department, and are completely unable to use our influence to talk the world out of letting China establish a foothold in their countries.  ...  >"When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!"  \- \*Donald J. Trump, the 45\*\*\**^(th)* *president, and the fucking idiot who isolated the USA from the world markets, accidentally making way for the totalitarian Chinese government to establish a new sphere of control over world markets.*|2019-08-28 10:56:06

If you look back at July 2018 when the initially tariffs went into effect, the market mooned the entire month. Look up July 6 2018 to July 26 2018.

However with earnings in less than 2 weeks, I think ACB has the chance to really standout and take the market cap lead.
