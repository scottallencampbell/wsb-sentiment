pnnhpi|gehav8|gehav8|9|The ADP numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for April on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. That report is forecast to show the unemployment rate rose to 16% last month and that more than 20 million jobs were lost.  That would easily surpass the post-World War Two record unemployment rate of 10.8% reached in November 1982.  But economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago are estimating that the true rate of unemployment could be between 25.1% and 34.6%.  &#x200B;  SPY 330 CALLS GO!|2020-05-06 07:30:05

po4ens|gehav8|gehav8|8|On Vegas and reopening...my point isn‚Äôt that so many people would be scared to go.

Casino hopping would be a pain...it pretty much kills a major experience of going in the first place. Inside the casino they‚Äôll have to sanitize cards and chips and remove table capacity. Everyone will be waiting and waiting.  Demand will drop for leisure travel if the experience is a high friction stressful hassle with lines and checks everywhere.

ppdxs5|gehav8|gehav8|10|This earning season's reminds me of my first few parties in college.  I was super-excited, had all of the right clothes to wear, and was definitely looking forward to flossing the new-and-improved me.  The first party was definitely cool, as I felt my way around, filled with nervousness and anticipation.  I laughed off the fact I didn't actually go home with a woman that first night, or even get a number, or even talk to a woman, but I had a nice buzz and was prepared for my next shot.   It was kind of like my bet on Dominoes this earning's season, in hindsight it didn't work out, but I had done the research and looked forward to the next round.  The next few parties in college, I began to resent how easy it seemed to be for everybody else to have a good time, and get apparently what I was looking for.  I was beginning to get less and less optimistic, and that initial sense of euphoria and confidence was slowly turning into self-loathing and the feeling of petulance of not belonging there.  As I bet AMZN and MSFT this earnings season, the same feeling became me.  Why didn't I just click on FB instead, why did I blow $1600 on an expiring weekend SPY Put.  None of it makes sense, to anybody.    Eventually at the end of my freshman year, I realized that parties weren't for me, and maybe I'm just a weirdo.  Maybe earnings aren't for me either, but I could just be broke.  In either event, I have no business being there or here.|2020-05-06 16:28:44

pozb47|gehav8|gehav8|5|I know $LYFT puts is the most obvious play ever and its hard to know what the market expects and what's priced in, but what I can say is looking at the shape of Uber and Lyft's charts over the past couple months...even though Lyft has recovered less, the gap is still smaller than it should be. Uber is so much better capitalized to weather a few months of downturn.  Uber has the Eats business that is booming and replacing some of the lost rides revenue, whereas Lyft does not.  Uber has more firepower to fight the big California worker classification suit that hit both companies today.  Lyft usage is even more tilted to a few major urban areas where reopenings are far away.  There is upside to ridesharing - once big cities do open up, anyone living in a transit-friendly city like NYC but wealthy enough to take a rideshare will be opting for the rideshare way more often than public transit, whereas they may have used transit before. But it will be a bumpy road to get there.  Make of all of that what you will, I'm not 100% certain Lyft will fall after earnings but I am quite sure they will fall even further behind Uber as a result of all of this mess, and there's a good chance that this will be obvious on Friday after both companies have reported.|2020-05-06 14:27:19

pqcjec|gehav8|gehav8|3|Ok so rtx is only about 15 percent above the March low. Most other defense stocks are around 30 percent plus up. Even BA has bounced higher.   Drawing a little red line from March 18 to today seems to show today it hit the trendline. Williams R, which some say shows things a bit sooner than rsi, is showing oversold.

pneqcu|gehav8|gehav8|4|Nothing to see here...   (CNN)In no particular order and with varying degrees of urgency, here's a list of companies that have just in recent days said they are under extreme stress as a result of the coronavirus shutdowns.  These are companies that are in crisis: undergoing massive layoffs, posting record losses, and in some cases, filing for bankruptcy. Massive conglomerates Disney's parks are closed, its movies aren't in theaters, its cruise ships aren't at sea. The company said Tuesday that its profit plunged 91% in the first quarter. (It also said its Shanghai park will reopen next Monday.) GE is permanently cutting a quarter of its global workforce. Clothing companies J. Crew filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday. The Gap is running out of money and stopped paying rent. Retailers J.C. Penney has missed debt payments and is in negotiations with lenders. Neiman Marcus has a crushing debt load. Sears has been distressed for years. Food Tyson Foods has warned of more meat plant closures even as Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to keep plants open. Fitness Gold's Gym filed for bankruptcy. Foreign airlines Lufthansa is losing $1 million an hour. Domestic airlines United says employees should consider voluntary separation and also laid off a third of its back office staff. Boeing, which was already in trouble because of problems with its 737 Max, will cut 16,000 people. Cruise lines Norwegian Cruise Line's accounting firm said in a government filing that it may go out of business. Hotels and housing share services Airbnb announced massive layoffs. Marriott and Hilton have both furloughed employees. Autos Hertz got an emergency lifeline from lenders. Car companies are having difficulty too. Ford told investors it will lose $5 billion next quarter. Oil companies If oil stays extremely cheap, hundreds of US oil companies could go bankrupt. Not all companies are under stress. Amazon views itself as part of the national shelter-in-place infrastructure and it is reaping handsome rewards. It's making $10,000 in sales every second.|2020-05-06 05:18:59

pp2b5j|gehav8|gehav8|2| What if the elites (especially older ones), based on incomplete data from China, panicked and assumed a 4-6% mortality rate of the Coronavirus, and that the virus and measures to control it would cause a global economic collapse on par with the Great Depression, and positioned themselves accordingly (going to cash and gold, selling property, shorting stocks and other assets).   What if newer evidence suggested that the virus wasn't that dangerous after all, that it probably had a .1-.2% mortality rate, and that social distancing and mask wearing would be enough to control it.   Do you seriously expect these people to just say "well, Depression cancelled" and cut their losses?   No. They will demand lockdowns go on for 1-2 years (or longer) to make their bearish bets pay out.|2020-05-06 14:52:00

The website is also down more often than not and you can‚Äôt buy a single call through the app. Na you gotta buy a near the money strangle. Countless times I call, wait two hours for some jerk off who doesn‚Äôt trade or invest say ‚Äúhuh I don‚Äôt really see the problem.‚Äù No you don‚Äôt see the problem in buying at the highest ask and selling for lowest bid? ‚ÄúUh no dude have you tried uhhhhh buying and holding over the long term?‚Äù Cocksucker have you even looked at the fucking economy?!|2020-05-06 07:17:30

pow8nd|gehav8|gehav8|4|Finally. We can all take a rest now. The Simpson theory has finally been confirmed  MAJOR UPDATE  Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.  But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Global markets are in turmoil. People don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves.  Well, I bring good news.  In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.  The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.  This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA  In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....  Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....  Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason  I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you‚Äôll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it‚Äôs about to get crazy  The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.  ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren‚Äôt available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.‚Äù  The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.  They proceed to follow Bart‚Äôs plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious ‚Äúboss‚Äù.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don‚Äôt need to worry about that andn I don‚Äôt need to explain it....  But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.  America‚Äôs passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.  I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you‚Äôve earned it.|2020-05-06 14:02:11

Market volatility drives these companies' top line and volatility is not going away any time soon. Firms are also now forced to accelerate adoption of electronic processing, also driving up the size of the market.  Given how conservative TW is.. it is telling in my view that they priced their follow-on at just $50. Look at stock history since IPO.

poyp80|gehav8|gehav8|0|Insane how anybody who thinks Peloton isn't pricing in quite a huge beat. The downside is soooo much more pronounced right now when the majority of people who buy the bikes have smaller or larger businesses, which in March was completely uncertain what was to happen and no stimulus or PPP till April just about. 35% in a month, 10b company. I do agree its a great company but as of now rich people aren't really spending money either. Lotta people got them for Christmas resulting in a massive last quarter but yeah, idk. Seems high. I mean who really knows, I only bought so I could feel something while I am at work lol. Puts are cheap for the possibility, nice lottos. I am excited either way, nothing I can't completely lose. Not really too worried about the 600. Their financials are not what a 10b company should have. FAD, never seen more people biking outside this past few weekends in NY, why would you wanna stay inside when you are always inside. people wanna get out|2020-05-06 14:22:23

pnr7t2|gehav8|gehav8|-6|queers stop comparing this time to 2008 and 2000. There are key major differences. One Donald fucking pump does not care how much the debt goes up, or how bad the numbers look. He sees the economy as the stock market. We have a parabolic debt to GDP ratio. Whats the dons answer? Cut capital gains taxes. The other key major difference here is the fed vowed to do ANYTHING to keep the market higher. ANYTHING. Wanna know why warren buffet isn't buying? He wanted to buy stakes of companies like Disney and boeing. The fed got in his way of that. The fed immediately jumped in with junk bond buying. The companies hurt the most by this raised enough cash. We faced something worse then the 08 financial crisis and stocks didn't go nearly as low. Is this good for the long term? FUCK no. Will the fed throw in the towel? Yes by next quarter if you cant get your shit together you are fucked. For now though the stock market will go higher. Also the amount of stock buybacks we are seeing is still monstrous. Apple and google are big enough to move the entire nasdaq and S&P. No ones buying them here? No one wants them at these valuations? That's fine they are buying back their own shares. Guys just buy calls until the next quarter when we realize the long term damage of these shutdowns is never going away.|2020-05-06 08:13:31

ppa7oy|gehav8|gehav8|-8|Finally. We can all take a rest now. The Simpson theory has finally been confirmed  MAJOR UPDATE  Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  So as everyone knows, this information leaked, and people around the world have gone into a panic... Staying almost exclusively in their homes so that they can rewatch Simpson and gather clues and hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.  But not only has the world of Simpson changed, our own world has changed. The streets are empty. There is panic in the air. Global markets are in turmoil. People don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves.  Well, I bring good news.  In the nations concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Simpson, we have all come together to reach a massive consensus: YES, it is confirmed that the Simpsons are IN FACT, CIA operatives, pulling a rouse on the citizens of Springfield.  The Simpsons have been gathering evidence on a MASSIVE scale for almost 30 years , completely undetected.  This was found by a viewer https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIffbQK0wlA  In the clip we can see Homer, who, now knowing what we know, is ALWAYS mimicking and pretending to be a Springfield citizen. We can see him slide away from a shifty situation , and we can hear his internal dialogue ..... very concerning.....  Homer pretends to be incompetent solely to keep his cover and continue retaining critical information on the citizens of Springfield....  Another viewer has told me, thy found a clip of Bart Simpson exiting a CIA van.... however, this clip has been stripped from all internet platforms , and for good reason  I have also received a VHS tape of a Simpson lost episode... one that was never aired, and you‚Äôll see why in a moment. Due to copyright infringement, I cannot share this clip, but I will articulate it as best I can, hold onto Your hat, it‚Äôs about to get crazy  The Simpson family sits in their kitchen room, under a gloomy light, looking defeated. No one speaks, until Bart breaks the silence.  ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll say it, the new measures are not working ... we are not collecting enough Information, and the boss is not going to be happy .. we need to take it up a notch. My plan is to increase the video and microphone budget. We will cover the whole town in the new technologies that are available today that weren‚Äôt available in season one. We will cover every inch of this city until we know everything about these people.‚Äù  The whole Simpson family nods in agreement.  They proceed to follow Bart‚Äôs plan.... and it works wonderfully , they receive more funding from this mysterious ‚Äúboss‚Äù.... the B storyline was about Apu so you don‚Äôt need to worry about that andn I don‚Äôt need to explain it....  But finally, we have uncovered the real truth.  America‚Äôs passion for Simpson has brought us all together .... and now we know the truth.  I want to thank everyone in the world for watching Simpson over these past few weeks trying to figure this out. I think we can go Back to our regular jobs now, as our problem has been solved. And we can all breath out a collective sigh of relief. Watch more Simpson tonight America, you‚Äôve earned it.|2020-05-06 15:57:11
