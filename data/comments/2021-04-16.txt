Can I be wrong YES, however statistically speaking the pull back is increasingly more likely than an additional surge.

uprjns|mrzzt0|mrzzt0|7|I have a conspiracy theory. So banks have tanked on earnings for a couple of reasons, one of them is that I believe they were able to make increased profit because they took money out of their loan loss reserves. Now why would a big bank(like jpm) do that if they think a crash might be coming? The simple answer is bc they can. Jpow has been going on about how economic recovery is better than expected, no inflation, etc etc. Jamie dimon is probably one of the most tactical CEOs, everything he does is borderline tactical genius. When you see shitty companies like airlines or cruises getting government money for ‚Äúbeing important to the economy‚Äù it‚Äôs easy to see why any big bank, which is a backbone of the us and even global economy(banking) would want to open themselves up to more risk. They have essentially a government who is willing to print any amount of money to keep this ship afloat.|2021-04-16 07:11:01

upwsei|mrzzt0|mrzzt0|7|Might do a more comprehensive DD/Technical post with charts later, but looking at the market currently there's some things to note:   - Both SPY (/ES) and QQQ (/NQ) have pulled away from their 21/50 day SMAs and are a large way away from their 200 day SMA. If you look at the past year, when these gaps have widened significantly we have had a pull back, a regression to the mean.   - We are coming down off a massive peak in GEX (gamma exposure) which will probably unwind today given the monthly opex. Edit: Forgot to mention this has generally preceded (exacerbated) volatility in the market.   - For the last three months, the back-end of the month has been choppy to the downside, post-monthly opex it would seem.   We could very well grind higher for another week, but if the pattern follows I would expect us to see volatility to the downside towards the end of the month, and significant at that, not just chop. Thinking %7-10 pullback is possible here.|2021-04-16 08:01:12

Even though the people I was arguing with about it a week or two ago had their puts become worthless, most of the open calls - including mine rip - will also expire worthless, and I think the problem with the play was the overuse of super short dated options instead of shares.  I sold my shares to get weeklies, but now I fully regret it. Even (at least one) bear agrees that the share price will eventually reach analyst targets in the high 30s/low 40s. I've been a bull for this stock since i found out about it and it hasn't disappointed me, but I feel like if it was capable of emotions then it would be disappointed in me.

Futures are pointing a bit higher as of 0630, with small caps leading indices (Russell 2000 up 0.3%). Dow and S&P are up 0.1%. The Nasdaq is down about 0.1%.  There are more earnings on tap today, with a bunch of banks led by Morgan Stanley reporting in the pre-market. It‚Äôs been a banner earnings season so far, with just about everybody beating analyst estimates. If a company does fall short you can expect the market to punish its stock.  Nothing doing on the economic calendar for today so things may be relatively quiet barring some unforeseen news.  Commodities are pushing higher, led by the so-called ‚Äúsoft commodities‚Äù: Corn and soybeans are at 52-week highs this morning. Wheat is pushing higher as well. Maybe a sign of inflation concerns.

I was against it, but I see how it helps Americans."|2021-04-28 08:21:48

uqg0jc|mrzzt0|mrzzt0|-9|Fellow apes, it's bear hunting season. This time, they're coming for Skillz, a gaming company that specializes in esports. I am long on this company, as I like the company's potential based on solid fundamentals such as growth, earnings, and industry. I also think it's technicals merit a good entry point right now because it has established support at around 15 (250 DMA, RSI oversold, MACD histogram showing reduced selling pressure).  The reason for this oversold position is due to them being caught up in the recent Archegos incident (Bill Hwang's a legend by the way), and greedy short sellers taking advantage of the recent share lockup period that expired at the end of March. This presents a good opportunity to get in, as earnings season is coming up, and they absolutely crushed it last time!|2021-04-16 10:28:11
