giksq4|eyoh7t|eyoh7t|39|>   >   >Fun fact: Tesla is not part of the S&P 500, even though it’s now the number two car company on the planet. **Would the index look different if the galloping shares of Tesla were in the mix? Yes**.   With a market cap of \~$140.6 billion at yesterday’s close, Tesla would be the 50th largest in the S&P (nestled between Nvidia and PayPal). At that level, every 1% move in the stock adds \~0.16 point to the S&P 500. Tesla, however, has been on a gargantuan run, up 86.5% YTD. **If it were in the S&P 500, it would have added roughly 13 points to the index, making it the second most influential stock this year**. The only other company contributing that many points is Microsoft which has added 15.4 pts, accounting for 85% of the index’s gain, according to Bloomberg’s historical movers function.      >   >The Russell 3000 index gives an idea of what the stock market leader board might look like -- the biggest point contributors to its YTD advance are Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet.   >   >Here’s the macro point: if Tesla joins the S&P 500, it’ll be one more reason to look at the index as a different breed of equity animal. Elon Musk’s creation, like that of the other American titans, is about more than cars -- it’s about a platform business and building a moat around that business. Tesla has a 10-year head start on the industry, and can leverage that advantage in all sorts of areas related to cars, mobility, solar panels or efficient homes, as stock holder Ron Baron argued on CNBC earlier. If Tesla becomes a stable growth company, it could differentiate the S&P from its peers and support the index’s sticky and lofty valuations.    >   >N.B: Given Tesla’s prominence, its entry into the S&P seems inevitable, along with the index-fund buying such an event will engender. When is the big question. Tesla meets all the S&P’s requirements save for four consecutive quarters of positive earnings, and that might be true when 2Q results are reported in late July.|2020-02-04 07:55:11

girlzx|eyoh7t|eyoh7t|24|I know there's a healthy way to trade and an unhealthy way to trade.  I'm usually pretty good about keeping a healthy mentality but this TSLA stuff has my mind in a pretzel right now.  The regret of not buying options when it broke resistance... I could retire.  Usually "what could have been" doesn't eat me up but I was so heavy into watching TSLA that it just hurts.  While this has exceeded my wildest expectations and I would have sold prior to $1,000 (is it at $1,000 yet?  It's going up so fast that I'm sure it'll be at $1,000 by the time I'm done typing)... it's just killing me inside.  I need to leave until I can get my head right.  I just put my money into a couple of ETF's to buy and hold in meantime.  Good luck!  See you guys soon!|2020-02-04 09:15:53

giigbm|eyoh7t|eyoh7t|6|Ron Baron on CNBC pumped the hell out of TSLA and I agree don't fight this and ride it to the moon. Thing is his argument was so confusing to me.    His point was in 10 years Tesla will sell 10 million cars a year. Right now they hope to set a record in 2020 with 500k in maxed out facilities. So they'd need to invest to build more factory capacity for 40x total cars or 38 more factories equal to the 2 they have today. OK possible but  highly unlikely.  When asked why Honda, Toyota, VW, etc... have to stand by and watch instead of compete his answer was they'd need to invest in brand new factories.    He's filthy rich and may be %100 correct but he made no logical sense.|2020-02-04 07:23:38

gj9in5|eyoh7t|eyoh7t|6|Lol. Which of you thudfucks was this, I wonder?  https://images.app.goo.gl/imjs8ybuSEMbJwNS8  "My ex husband and his circle of closest friends were big into this for a number of years. After all they're high earning guys with computer science and mathematics degrees, they're "smarter than average", why wouldn't they succeed!  I'll spare you the full story but none of them made millions. We're not married any more and actually I don't think any of them are, friendships were ruined, jobs were lost, there were arrests, high risk situations in illegal casinos, hospitalizations, theft, secondary abuse of substances from stress. While a high earner myself with a good net worth I still carry around some financial fallout and I was never part of it.  Gambling addictions are an absolute curse. I went to some of the Gamblers Anonymous meetings or whatever they're called and the stories told by various people would stand your hair on end. These addictions wreck you and every relationship you have, they lead to abuse of alcohol/drugs/food/whatever, they ruin futures. And as they are not well understood you are less likely to find help or sympathy than if you were hooked on booze, it's seen as a character fault.  Do not get involved in this shit. You're not "different". Much safer to be one of the people selling the dream and the systems and the training courses. But then you're an abusive parasite. "|2020-02-04 12:07:38

If we ever have something like a 2008, or remotely close to it, all these people who think markets are free money are going to be cashing in their 409Ks and swiping the sell faster than you can imagine even if they lose money.

gihko1|eyoh7t|eyoh7t|-4|Hey guys, I’d like to get into options but I’m terrified of being assigned or a naked call so I’m trying to understand both.   If I buy a call ITM OR OTM, make a profit and then turn around and sell it, is there any risk of being assigned or losing more than my premium? I’m more worried of being assigned. I use Robinhood and heard bad things about it.|2020-02-04 07:10:55
