Bond yields have tumbled over the last two months, a sign investors expect poorer economic growth and potential rate cuts from the Fed and other central banks.   Long-term government bond yields have held below the level of some short-term yields, including the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate, for much of the past two months, a so-called inversion of the yield curve that has often preceded rate cuts.   "Maybe the fed-funds rate is a little bit out of kilter with market-determined rates," Mr. Kaplan said in an interview Tuesday morning. "I'm open-minded to at least arguments on that subject."   The persistence of the yield curve inversion "would make you consider at least a tactical adjustment -- not a change in strategy, not the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle," he said.   >   >**Any reduction in the benchmark fed-funds rate, currently in a range between 2.25% and 2.5%, should be "modest, restrained, a limited move,**" Mr. Kaplan said.  &#x200B;  **2.

There's just no chance of it.  They can just devalue the Yuan if their economy tanks.  They have no incentive to cut a deal right now given that they can go for devaluation if tariffs bite harder.

tx7sfp|cdvkq7|cdvkq7|1|    **Fed's Kaplan Says Rate Cut Could Be Warranted Based on Bond-Market Signals**  >WASHINGTON -- Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he ***could*** be convinced by arguments to cut rates based on signals coming from bond markets, even though he hadn't penciled in any rate cuts this year at the central bank's June policy meeting.   Bond yields have tumbled over the last two months, a sign investors expect poorer economic growth and potential rate cuts from the Fed and other central banks.   Long-term government bond yields have held below the level of some short-term yields, including the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate, for much of the past two months, a so-called inversion of the yield curve that has often preceded rate cuts.   "Maybe the fed-funds rate is a little bit out of kilter with market-determined rates," Mr. Kaplan said in an interview Tuesday morning. "I'm open-minded to at least arguments on that subject."   The persistence of the yield curve inversion "would make you consider at least a tactical adjustment -- not a change in strategy, not the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle," he said.      >   >**Any reduction in the benchmark fed-funds rate, currently in a range between 2.25% and 2.5%, should be "modest, restrained, a limited move,**" Mr. Kaplan said.|2019-07-16 11:10:37

txg3vj|cdvkq7|cdvkq7|0|Idiot who bought options without knowing what they are here. Have since read up.   Still holding AMD $35 calls expiring this week at a loss. Sell now or wait to see if it shoots up tomorrow? Time decay is something I still dont fully understand, I get that the closer to expiration the less chance for the call to go up but I dont know how "real" a hit theta is. Like, if I do wait till tomorrow will the shorter time cancel out any improvements in stock price?|2019-07-16 12:36:44
