That would be a 20% correction from the top assuming there was no earnings growth but since there was and there will be more, 15% off the top would be the p/e ration inline with interest rates.

v57nye|shsbxg|shsbxg|7|#Housing  Simple math:  A $500k mortgage at 3.0% interest rate is a $2,108 monthly payment (avoiding mortgage insurance, property tax, and insurance).  A 500k mortgage at 4.5% is $2,533. A 500k mortgage at 6% is 2,998.  We are about to see one of the wildest housing markets in many, many years. And the pure mania of people trying to buy now with rates still low is going to cause an absolute implosion.  The FED is stepping away from mortgage backed securities, which is leaving a void that requires higher interest rates to satisfy buyers‚Ä¶ as someone else mentioned in a different thread, when rates move, they move fast, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see 6% mortgages by end of year.

v4mcxs|shsbxg|shsbxg|1|There's one thing üåàüêªs really don't understand well.  They think the Fed is some illuminati cabal with a secret agenda rather than fallible humans that can easily be incompetent.  They're not just trying to pump markets, they look primarily at real economic data.  If the Fed is known to rug pull, they have no credibility providing support in the first place.  Why invest in a semi-conductor fab facility when demand is going to evaporate?  Everything is gradual on purpose because it has to be that way.  They don't just want a soft-landing because of vanity, it's to prevent from destroying the Fed.  In an emergency they will act and at some point maybe they will feel like they need to but it won't be without reason.  Right now they are praying that their "transitory" thesis is intact just way longer than they thought.  Memes aside the truth is probably in the middle somewhere.|2022-02-01 07:09:55
