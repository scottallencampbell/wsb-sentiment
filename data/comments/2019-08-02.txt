The chances of a 1% positive market move today are probably better than the chances he had on the previous two moves given the market has been down for 4 straight trading days.

Got in some semis puts QCOM 3. Kept 8/16 SBUX 100c. averaged down a bit on those (I hate averaging down and wouldnt recommend) 4. Got in MCD calls. Volume looks good here and yesterday's daily candle at the bottom might be a good print for a reversal. Usually considered safe haven stock during trade wars along with KO. 5.

vt5sad|cl2nsp|cl2nsp|2|Anybody chasing BYND in either direction needs to just sit tight and wait to see what happens when the new 3.25 million shares come online.  Either that will alleviate short pressure and there will be quick profit taking by those new shareholders (up $20 per share automatically) as well as an additional 1.5-1.7 million shares available to short.  Or those new shareholders will sit tight and the new shares available to short will get shorted fast to little downside effect thus keeping borrowing costs high.  If that happens, we could end up with another pop upwards.  Just wait to see which scenario we end up in; most of these things will be clear next week.|2019-08-02 11:30:29

This is a key point, we don’t know whose on the sidelines, and this could very well be the market sell off test they have been waiting for.  I think bear gang is gonna get disappointed again.  With more rate cuts coming, side liners are coming in next week, so they don’t miss out on the dip they’ve finally been waiting for.  I say this with only having 1k on Apple calls.|2019-08-02 15:26:21

Between Trump's tariffs, China's response to Trump's tariffs, a weaker than expected jobs report that's coming 2 days after a rate cut,  S&P is down 2% in 2 days, it's August which is generally a lower volume month but stock are still up almost 20% for the year, cult favorite BYND is down 25%, cult favorite TSLA went from $265 to $228 to $242 to $233 in 8 days, APPL has been up and down, isn't the yield curve still inverted... I guess my point is that the market feel more like chance than strategy today.|2019-08-02 08:03:09

New Tariffs take effect Sept 1st 2. Tariff increase delayed beyond Sept 1st 3. Tariff % increased/decreased  The down move was already made, it's wait and see if we get a bounce. GUSH & DRIP are trading great v-patterns.. can't wait for NUGT to pullback again. And I say anytime SPY gets oversold, I'm buying calls when it bounces.

The other thing is that I want to be in the S&P long term and actually want to buy and hold so should I chill out and just leave the money in there? I want to be in the market for over a decade anyway.    Edit: I bought 10k in shares of VOO the Vanguard ETF.
