This is an investment, not a trade. How good will it feel to see a Nikola truck on the road for the first time? You'll own a part of that truck.”  The next post reads: “To all those that bought in at 10, 14, 19, 26, 34. The next days, weeks, months are totally insignificant when we're talking about a nationwide hydrogen infrastructure roll out with a new breed of hybrid trucks.

sz89jg|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|9|>What happens is a hurricane. Boom. It's the D-word. And I don't even wanna mention the D-word. It took many years to recover from 1929. 10? 10. Ok. I heard 13 or 14 years. But Larry says 10, so let's go with 10. And it's gonna get better fast. Because a lot of numbers we've seen, they're not even numbers. They're from last month. And, by the way, you had the greatest 50-day rally we've seen on the exchanges. And we have a lot of protestors, and we have something else--it's called a pandemic. And we have progress. So it's tremendous. It's been an incredible thing to see. It's a good thing to see. Of course, economists say we've had incredible numbers of year. And this year. This will turn around. Your 401(k)s. The numbers. With the pandemic. And with one of the worst things that's ever happened. Our country's never lost anything close to this. Whether it's Pearl Harbor. Or the towers. The world is suffering. The fact that we're doing well, I see already, we'll work with China too, 186 countries, what happened should have never happened. It's shocking. I watch Jim Rose. I watched Charles Kramer, Charles Payne. A lot of people got it right. They had confidence in me. We were in uncharted territory. Renewal and restoration of this country is gonna be my big focus because it's taken care of itself and also opportunity zones criminal justice reform.

sz69y4|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|10|   Bots won't let me publish my DD so fuck it... I'll publish it here:  **Silicon Motion (SIMO)**  Autists - Today I would like to share a growth stock that's been undervalued for a while. Became more attractive than ever with today's dip. Our DD today is on Silicon Motion Technology Corp. - they engage in the development, manufacture, and supply of semiconductor products for the electronics market. They offer embedded and expandable storage, radio frequency integrated circuits, and embedded graphics. The reason why I've decided to take the extra leap of doing DD is because I saw a few technical signs that the stock may see a big spike soon. Here's a summary of my findings:  * **Exceptional Earnings Performance:** While the historical EPS growth rate for Silicon Motion is 3.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 22.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 1.5%. * **Positive Outlook Into Q2 Earnings:** The current-year earnings estimates for Silicon Motion have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.2% over the past month. * **Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio:** Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator for companies like SIMO. Right now, Silicon Motion has an S/TA ratio of 0.71, which means that the company gets $0.71 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.66, it can be said that the company is more efficient. * **Solid yield will soon attract big money:** With a seven-year payment history and a 3.3% yield, many investors probably find Silicon Motion Technology intriguing. Shareholders always check that Silicon Motion Technology’s dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. I think Silicon Motion Technology has an acceptable payout ratio and its dividend is well covered by cashflow. This, coupled with the earnings growth, is a good sign that large institutional investors will soon buy into SIMO. * **Competitors have surged, it's now time for SIMO:** The company’s main competitors (and peers) include Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) that is trading 21.93% up over the past 12 months. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) is 28.87% up on the 1-year trading charts. * **P/E Ratio:** SIMO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.51, which is far below the semiconductor industry average of 19.48. For reference one of SIMO's main competitors, LSCC has a forward P/E of 35.90. SIMO outperforms competition based on this metric. * **Improving Sentiment On Asian Markets:** Although SIMO is not technically a "Chinese" stock, it is important to note that Hong Kong’s stock market recently had its biggest gain since the end of March, even though the United States is set to scrap its special trading status, as optimism rose that the Trump administration will not sanction Beijing for passing a controversial national security law for the city. Regardless of this, SIMO is a HSI stock and is compliant with international trade regulations.  Bottom line: Silicon Motion is a solid growth stock with stellar fundamentals. The company is long overdue a big spike, so I expect this stock to jump anywhere from 10-15% in the next rally this month, so load up on June/July calls for maximum gains. You'll also find that IV is pretty low (around 38% for June calls) - an opportunity for those who want to ride the IV fluctuations for quick gains.|2020-06-05 09:40:53

They believe there is going to be a further crash etc etc. They were cheering where markets were crashing because it would reflect bad on Trump.

John Kerry and Dick Friedman were sitting around a dinner table talking about Trump with a few other people. I was around to hear it. Dick Friedman told a story about how in the 80s he went skiing with Trump and their wives. Donald bought Ivana, his ex wife, a brand new skiing onesie. The type they would wear in the 80s. Trump had also invited his gf but she was supposed to keep her distance. Ivana and the gf ran into each other on the mountain and they were wearing the same brand new skiing onesie😂😂😂 and proceeded to get in a huge fight.  The end.

syo2gw|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|7|I submitted this as a post but the shit didn’t go thru (mods are fags), but I’d like to have this discussion with you $5K RH traders making $100 gains a week  I found this video from 1998 which, I think, explains why Buffett divested from a large portion of Berkshire’s holdings earlier this year. In the video, he mentions that he only thinks the market is overvalued if:  1) Interest rates are likely to rise  and  2) Corporate profits aren’t likely to stay at sustained levels   The second reason is why I think he sold off the airlines and bank stocks like JPM and GS. Sure, he could’ve made money in the short-term, but these companies are overwhelmingly likely to be increasingly unprofitable in the short- and mid-term future, thus leading to over valuations in the market during these time-spans.   tldr; buffy smart, u dumb  BRKB 7/10 $195c  [Link to video](https://youtu.be/nbGjQ4_cCLc)|2020-06-05 06:32:05

syrwi0|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|3|What are your thoughts on theta plays for AAL today?  I've been analyzing and re-analyzing because it looks like there is significant put skew.  With IV so high, why not sell a ton of Jan 2021 puts in the $4-8 strike range? I'm thinking if IV crush doesn't take it to 50% profit in the next month or two, expiration isn't that far away and you're looking at a significant ROC. Maybe make it a spread between the $1 and $8 strikes to manage BP reduction.  Worst case: even if you sold hundreds of the $1 or $2 strike puts, AAL would have to go 100% bankrupt with no redemption or hope for you to take a loss - in the next six months. That's a non-zero possibility, but in their past bankruptcies (like a typical airline) shares haven't become worthless. When the prices dipped under $1 in 2012 they shot back up to like $60 the following year (some of that was from consolidation).  Might be worth it to take a look at naked selling the Jan 21 $40c as well. If IV crush doesn't make it profitable then that's plenty of time to buy shares to hedge losses before the strike is hit.  What do you think?|2020-06-05 07:20:46

sz0h46|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|3|For those who are worried it's too late to join the AAL and other airlines party - I've just loaded into Air Canada.   Its still down massively compared to other airlines and I'm sure at some point it'll be next in line for the insane boost / short squeeze / whatever it is.  Especially whenever the announcement comes that the US / Canada border is being reopened.  Can't give a put/call as I'm the UK and we don't really do many options here, we do spread bets and CFD trading.  I'm sure there's a gazillion reasons why it's not great from a fundamentals POV but the market is beyond rational now and I'm just targeting whatever might be in line for the next pump.|2020-06-05 08:49:28

syvdxi|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|2|08:44 AM EDT, 06/05/2020 (MT Newswires) -- AstraZeneca (AZN) will start manufacturing a potential vaccine for the coronavirus, Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told the BBC on Friday. "We are starting to manufacture this vaccine right now - and we have to have it ready to be used by the time we have the results," Soriot said in an interview with the BBC's Today Programme. The chief executive said that trials of the vaccine are still under way but the company decided to move ahead with production in order to meet future demand for the vaccine if proven effective. He also said that early production will allow AstraZeneca to supply two billion doses of the vaccine. "Of course, with this decision comes a risk but it's a financial risk and that financial risk is the vaccine doesn't work," Soriot said. "Then all the materials, all the vaccines, we've manufactured will be wasted."|2020-06-05 07:59:32

I know how to keep track of and avoid free riding and have enough cash to handle it, but I just can’t determine anywhere if it’s possible to get hit with PDT rules in my Roth, and even if I did, wouldn’t I be ok due to my minimum equity requirement met of $25k?|2020-06-05 08:05:52

I bought some super OTM GM calls as a last Hail Mary which brought me up to $45 the next day. Rolled those out to some slightly less OTM GM/Ford calls expiring June 12. Today I was up to $250 in my account. I cashed out for a profit at open and reinvested about $35 back into some more slightly OTM GM/Ford calls expiring in 2 weeks on the dip. Those calls are already up 200%. Gonna sit the rest as cash gang and sleep easy this weekend. I have a feeling things will consolidate a bit early next week, and that will be my re-entry point. If shit does keep going up, then those slightly OTM calls will have worked in my favor. Shit feels great.|2020-06-05 10:53:39

Maybe there won't be a leg down, and if that's the case then at least I'm holding a bunch of boring winners and divvy stocks like T and NOBL, and obviously I haven't dumped my largest position by far (BA) because they're not even close to fully recovered.

szh2t3|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|1|Need help!    I bought WTRH yesterday at $1.97 on thinkorswim.  Now thinkorswim shows the "Cost" as $2.07, but still shows my trade price as $1.97.  I never purchased at $2.07.  I have no idea where this $2.07 number came from.  Yesterday, all trading after I bought in at $1.97 showed my P/L relative to the $1.97 price.  Now, today - it shows P/L relative to the $2.07 cost.  So right now the price is ABOVE where I bought in but my account shows me LOSING money.

On the plus side, the SPX3200C I bought two weeks ago is already ITM, so that’s nice. On the downside I sold 40k of UPRO last Thursday on the China news. Screwed myself again.

szr5uo|gx1vt8|gx1vt8|1|Not sure why no one's talking about CHK, it's up 36% as I'm typing this.  Everyone thought they (CHK) was heading for bankruptcy so they shorted it, making it one of the most shorted stocks on the market.  Today's initial bump looks like it's caused a short squeeze, meaning (I think and hope, because I bought $18 calls this AM when it was up "only" 17%) it will rise throughout the day to crazy levels.  I imagine it might crash back down Monday, but if you have a day trade to blow you could maybe make a few bucks.  It might be better as a stock buy/sell rather than an option play because the options are really low volume and the bid/ask spreads are terrible.  Oh - another thing, they did a reverse 200:1 stock split a few weeks back meaning they have a really small float, thus more volatility.|2020-06-05 12:29:24
