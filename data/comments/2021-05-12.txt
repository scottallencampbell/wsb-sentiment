xuv7pb|nal19o|nal19o|5|To all the people who think Powell won‚Äôt start tapering sooner than he says because he‚Äôs been clear that he won‚Äôt- you‚Äôre incorrect and here‚Äôs why. The dude said in mid 2018 that the fed was ‚Äúa long way from accommodative.‚Äù Why? Because he assumed that‚Äôs what Wall Street was expecting. Once it was apparent Wall Street was not expecting this and he had caused a small panic he immediately did an about face and took rates lower and began the entire narrative they have now. This did not start post Covid, Covid merely gave him permission to be completely unambiguous and never divert from the no hiking policy.  However over the last weeks calls have been growing for him to explain why we need such loose monetary policy in the face of higher inflation and a booming economy. I truly believe his position is going to become more and more uncomfortable and with CPI numbers going up it‚Äôs going to get that much harder for him. I believe a statement is coming real soon that they will see what happens or react as needed- something much more reserved than what they‚Äôve been saying.  In short J Pow does what he thinks Wall Street wants him to. This has been pretty obvious for almost three years. If you think he‚Äôs got some internal drive to keep inflation high and will do whatever he wants regardless of what the talking heads say you haven‚Äôt been paying attention.|2021-05-12 09:30:26

xuhc1s|nal19o|nal19o|13|JPow/Yellen can shout "inflation is transitory" all they want but nobody will trust them if the jobs situation means that we won't see rate hikes for 18-24 months.  Economy can look stagflationary if inflation gets out of control.  Only thing we have right now is the hope that supply chain normalization reduces pricing pressure.  But that's a slim hope when you see what's happening with housing markets and everything else.  Housing/used cars/chips/metals/resources... none of it looks transitory.  There's a lot more stimulus sloshing through the economy than can be absorbed.  And there's trillions in deferred consumption from past 15 months that will try to come back next 18 months.  If inflation hits high single digits, it can easily spiral out of control.  JPow/Yellen have to know that.|2021-05-12 07:38:26

xvb2py|nal19o|nal19o|12|This is not a bear market, but we are in a sideways consolidation pattern due to inflation concerns.  Most important thing to keep in mind is that right now we're in a tug of war between Fed/bond investors over whether inflation is transitory.  Bond holders have been dumping treasuries because they think Fed isn't going to be able to control inflation (or is wrong about it being transitory).  We need to see either of these things: 1) much faster job gains over next 5-10 months (something big like several million jobs would help) that would allow investors to price in rate hikes in mid/late 2022 to prevent an inflationary spiral, or 2) signs that inflation is actually transitory (which we aren't going to see/know for some time).  Either way, the worst possible route for stocks would be slow job gains and high inflation because it really means that the Fed will have to choose how hot it lets the economy go with a lot of pressure points for consumers and job seekers.  I don't think we're going to see the bottom fall out, but the next couple of months could look bumpy; the "easy money of 2020" is probably in the rearview mirror, and we're going to be for a lot of brutal rotations into and out of sectors (i.e. lots of growth/value rotations) as things bump along moving mostly sideways in aggregate.|2021-05-12 11:20:35

xu75kl|nal19o|nal19o|9|Futures are lower again this morning, with small caps leading the drop. Russell 2000 down almost 1%. Nasdaq down about 0.4%. Dow and S&P about 0.2% lower. The VIX is spiking, up 3% to close to 22, its highest level since March. That‚Äôs as of 0630.  This all follows a day of massive reversals. Tech was being bludgeoned yesterday morning while large caps were higher. By the close the Nasdaq was flat, while Dow finished down 1.4%, its worst day since February, and S&P was off 0.9%.  Today is all about the CPI report, due out at 0830. Economists are expecting a MoM figure of 0.2% and YoY print of 3.6%. This would be the highest level since 2011.   You‚Äôll be hearing a lot about that if the number meets or (God forbid) exceeds estimates. Further ramifications are discussed in the audio. Don‚Äôt feel like typing it.  One worrying sign are copper prices, which hit fresh all-time highs overnight. Unlike oil prices, this is not due to a temporary supply outage but very much about inflation.|2021-05-12 05:45:49

Those fears are likely unfounded though, because Jerome Powell has made it pretty clear he will prioritize full employment, just listen to his talks. I believe he will let inflation run in the pursuit of full employment, meaning even with high CPI he wont move rates until we see a lot better employment numbers.

He should have been made to serve his remaining years in prison and then have to work at walmart for the rest of his life. His actions are the reason why companies do accounting the way they do today, Enron was one of the biggest scams in human history the company was almost completely fraudulent and practically erased workers entire pensions because it was all tied up in enron stock  And to give you an idea enron was considered a safe investment at the time, it was the blue chip stock to be in everybody recommended it, it declaring bankruptcy was literally not even in people's minds.

xv3iwz|nal19o|nal19o|6|When the pandemic crashed the index down 30%, a lot of people declared that was the end of one market cycle and the beginning of a new one. I'm not so convinced it should be viewed that way since the pandemic was a unique event that, at least from the market's perspective, was quickly printed out of relevance by the Fed. It's not related to naturally occurring economic cycles, so a couple weeks later we were back to euphoria. I think we're still in the bull market that began in 2009, and we have the Fed printing at full speed so that all they have to do is stop, and the everything bubble will pop.

xuqea8|nal19o|nal19o|14|Just visited the USA. Hard to believe that just hours ago (before the CPI report) it used to be considered a developed and first world nation. In just a few months the crops were dead the electricity was cut off all the buildings were burnt the water supply was poisoned and chaos was everywhere.  I tried to buy some bread in American currency but it was inflating so rapidly that the store clerk asked me to barter instead. I pulled out some Euros and he fell at my feet begging for the EU to save them and how passing the stimulus bills was a mistake. I went outside with my bread and was stared at by the starving locals. Some child soldiers of the local warlord approached me and demanded the bread. When I refused they shot me with their guns, however as they were too poor for real guns they could only afford water guns. They then lead me to the local strongman warlord. He asked me if I was a foreigner and I said yes. Then he fell to his knees and begged me to buy the diamonds he had mined because he was failing to feed his child soldier army. I took pity on the man and handed him 5 euros. He thanked me and the entire city held a festival in my honour.|2021-05-12 08:54:05

I made some profits on GME, and AMC when they were rising a large amount on here a few months ago. I'm seeing these inverse etfs as a good choice now. I think the dow could go down for a few weeks and that would make dxd rise. My call is for it to be 50 by next week.

As many of you may have heard on Fox News, and others, but I like Fox because they are very fair and cover the story very beautifully, there was a hack of one our pipelines, which many say is the just one of the best pipelines in the world, just a tremendous pipeline. And I think we all know who is behind the hack, even if its not politically correct to say it. I'll say it. It was Chyna. They have just the meanest hackers. They train them over there, from a young age, with their chinese video games and phone apps and kung fu. I read recently that some of the chinese children even have more fingers so they can hack faster, can you believe that? CNN says 'oh no, you can't call him the chinese hackers', but I like to call them the Bamboo breachers. But America is strong, stronger than it has ever been. So strong, that we are going to build a new pipeline, without computers, that will be the biggest and best pipeline in the world. And we are going to build it from the east coast, to the west coast, all the way over the ocean, and to china. And then we are going bury China underneath a mountain of oil, and light the whole thing on fire.   Gas index ends the day up +256%.|2021-05-12 14:53:46

Read up on the gigantic asset bubble in Japan during the 80s and 90s that was caused by expansion of money supply, low interest rates, and lax fiscal policy. At one point, the small area of land around the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more than all of the entire real estate in CA.  It all crashed very badly when the central bank of Japan had to increase interest rates. It ended so, sooooo badly. It is scary how much the US has in common with 80s Japan. Increased money supply? Check. Sugar rush of low interest rates? Check.  Lax fiscal policy? Check.   Now what happens when the Fed copies the Bank of Japan and the fed has to start increasing interest rates?

Just a over a year ago all 3 traded from $0.50 to $2.50 and all of them are going back there.  There are several other companies which are the real deal or have true potential innovation.

xvgm75|nal19o|nal19o|1|DD on SWN:  We need electricity to power those Teslas and other Evs. We need electricity to power all of our computers (reddit access manchiens) and phones (reddit access machines and tendie makers).        Renewables are just not there yet, neither is battery tech. The market knows this, and govt. subsidies only go so far to push it.        Nuclear energy, even if it is "the future", is at least 30 years out at best. Worst, we probably won't even see it in our lifetimes.        NG is the best compromise and is replacing coal worldwide as countries develop.        Thus, I bring to you SWN:        Trading at $5 now, was $50 in the past. When NG prices shoot up, SWN will go INSANE.        It has no maturities until 2025 and positive free cash flow with proved reserves of 15 tcf and a total enterprise value 5.5 billion which is only about 40 cents per thousand cubic feet, which translates to $ 2.40 per barrel of oil equivalent. It has been destroyed over the last 4 years by Wall Street shorts and all nat gas producers have been savaged by the Wall Street analysts for Morgan Stanley etc. especially Morgan Stanley. Nat gas has been in a bear market since 2008 but with the destruction of the space last year there has been a collapse in drilling and there isn‚Äôt even oil drilling which used to bring associated gas with it.        Gas demand is still surging both as a power plant fuel replacing coal and export of lng to places like China where it‚Äôs been cold as shit. NG was recently going for $30 per thousand cubic feet in China lng market while trading at 2.75 here. Can‚Äôt go on forever.        Printing money just adds fuel to fire        Buying a producer with massive reserves is better than buying NG futures because there is no time limit. You can hold till you‚Äôre right. Which you have to be eventually. ESPECIALLY WITH INFLATION.|2021-05-12 11:57:51

xuz9pq|nal19o|nal19o|-2|So real quick hear me out fellow apes, with GE doing their reverse stock split of 8:1 , for ever 8 shares you own, it will become one share at a magnified price of equal value of those 8 shares combined. So my question to you all is if I were to buy call options for GE at say $50+ which is obviously unrealistic as can be until they do the reverse split. And if it were to happen before my options expire would that be ITM or am I just that stupid? Like to me this makes valid sense to buy tons of options at a very high price for expirations very far out in hopes of them activating the reverse stock split. Please any input would be great .|2021-05-12 09:59:29

Cathie Wood loves them, and in April their revenue exceeded the estimate and yet the short interest seems high at almost 30%.  They've exceeded guidance and I think they are on the cusp of how we will buy property in the future.  This seems like a perfect short squeeze opportunity, and at its current price of $15, easy for many to hold.  What am I missing, or is this as good as it looks?|2021-05-12 13:50:26

Back to same heavy short positioning on the dollar as in November/December/January.

This brought a small float stock with increasing revenue and covid testing down to yearly lows.. This company even PR'd today that they are still focusing on their IBD product that touches a $30 billion market.  The float is around 10 million with strong institutional and insider ownership. Blackrock and other reliable names are in it. PTs are $10 even without the IBD product.  The short float was over 10% before today and it was running out of shares to short today so it likely increased quite a bit.. Moreover, the volume was a 4200% increase from the average volume. Shares are trading and liquidity is up.  Comment if you are in on a squeeze soon.
