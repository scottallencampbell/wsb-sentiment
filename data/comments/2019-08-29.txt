yh1wni|cwzd17|cwzd17|35|If you were wondering what's happening with Fastly...it's a pump and dump. Tilray was also low vol pump. I'm waiting until November to short this (post lockup period)    While Fastly has a little over 93 million shares outstanding, most of those are in the hands of insiders and venture investors. Most Fastly shares are still subject to the post-IPO lockup period, which expires in November. For the moment, only the 13 million shares sold in the IPO are available to trade.  And that number is shrinking, thanks to Abdiel Capital, a New York-based investment firm that has been scooping up shares of Fastly with both fists. A few days after the IPO,¬†Abdiel disclosed ownership of 1.8 million of the company‚Äôs class A shares, those that were issued in the IPO, via a 13-G filing, indicating a passive investment, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A few weeks later, the company converted that into a¬†13-D filing,¬†which implies a more active investing posture.  By last Friday,¬†Abdiel‚Äôs stake had increased to 3.8 million shares.¬†That is 29% of the float prior to the expiration of the lockup. In short, the supply of Fastly shares is shrinking, and that is driving up the price.|2019-08-29 07:08:07

But most occur in waves, a bunch of days of upward movement followed by a few days (1-5 days) of consolidation or selling.  BYND's short squeeze had around 4-5 waves.  TLRY's had around 3 waves.  Some only have 1 wave and then go bust.  FSLY just finished its first wave.  Nobody can tell you what will happen next or whether there will be a second wave, but this is a part of how squeezing stocks move.|2019-08-29 13:27:19

"Hold tight, because McDonald's is bringing the heat starting in September," a McDonald's spokeswoman said.  Some franchisees don't trust McDonald's to get it right. The company invited a handful of restaurant operators to try a new breaded-chicken sandwich at its Chicago headquarters in May.

Short-term traders would look to sell just after the holiday while longer-term investors would wait until year end. Both strategies have proven to be profitable plays. The theory behind this effect is that traders are lightening up their holdings (selling) prior to the three day holiday in order to avoid any unexpected bad news. The selling pressure drives stock prices down, making those days a good opportunity for buying lower in the range."|2019-08-29 10:43:58

Trump‚Äôs comments followed signs from China that it wouldn‚Äôt immediately retaliate against the latest U.S. tariff increase and wanted to focus on removing new tariffs, to prevent a further escalation of the trade war.  ‚ÄúThere is a talk scheduled for today at a different level,‚Äù Trump said when asked in a Fox News radio interview if planned September talks with China are still on.  Read more: Wary of Trump‚Äôs Flip-Flops, China Prepares for Worst on Trade  Trump is under increasing pressure from Republican senators and others who say that uncertainty on trade is contributing to a U.S. economic slowdown.  Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, had told Politico: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question that trade uncertainty is contributing to the slowdown.‚Äù  Trump responded during the radio interview that he wasn‚Äôt going to give up, saying tariffs are working.  ### ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre Winning‚Äô  ‚ÄúSo what does Pat Toomey want me to do? Does he want me to say, let me put my hands up, China? Continue to rip us off, just continue,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúLet me give up right now China, even though we‚Äôre winning.‚Äù  A report earlier Thursday showed U.S. economic growth decelerated in the second quarter by more than initially reported, suggesting the president‚Äôs trade actions are weighing more heavily on the pace of expansion.  Stocks across Asia pared losses and U.S. stocks rallied alongside European stocks Thursday as investors saw reason for trade-talk optimism. But investors have sent bond yields plummeting in recent weeks amid growing concern the record-long U.S. expansion is approaching an end.  ‚ÄúChina has ample means for retaliation, but thinks the question that should be discussed now is about removing the new tariffs to prevent escalation of the trade war,‚Äù Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng told reporters in Beijing on Thursday. ‚ÄúChina is lodging solemn representations with the U.S. on the matter.‚Äù  When asked if that meant China wouldn‚Äôt retaliate at all for the latest escalation by the U.S., Gao didn‚Äôt elaborate but repeated the same comments. Gao‚Äôs commented amid signs China‚Äôs economy slowed further in August, according to a Bloomberg Economics gauge aggregating the earliest available indicators from financial markets and businesses.  Read more: China Indicates It Won‚Äôt Retaliate Now on New U.S. Tariffs  The U.S. announced new tariff rates earlier this month on $300 billion of Chinese goods that will come into effect in September and December. Beijing then retaliated last week, announcing its own higher import taxes on U.S. products.  That prompted a reaction from Trump, who tweeted that existing 25% tariffs on some $250 billion in imports from China would rise to 30% on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. He also pushed higher planned levies on $300 billion in Chinese goods due on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15.  ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs been ripping off the United States,‚Äù Trump said in the interview with Fox News. ‚ÄúI think they want to make a deal, I sort of think they have to make a deal, and we‚Äôll see what happens.‚Äù  ### Chinese Visit  Trump‚Äôs remarks follow comments Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said U.S. trade officials expect Chinese negotiators to visit Washington, but wouldn‚Äôt say whether a previously planned September meeting would take place.  ‚ÄúWe continue to have conversations. We‚Äôre planning for them to come,‚Äù Mnuchin said in an interview, declining to say whether the September encounter would happen.  On Monday, in off-the-cuff remarks to reporters at the Group of Seven summit in France, Trump claimed that Chinese officials called ‚Äúour top trade people‚Äù and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get back to the table.‚Äù Chinese officials weren‚Äôt able to confirm that account.|2019-08-29 11:49:08
