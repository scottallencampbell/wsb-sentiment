bdyrje|v5zgo8|v5zgo8|21|Much is made of the joys of parenthood. People love to say, “You get to experience childhood again through them.” And this is true. A child makes the first snow, the first electric guitar crunch in an amp, and the first tiger at the zoo all amazing again. But it’s simpler than this. And no one explains this. When I came to my daughter first thing in the morning, at 6 months old or so, her face said *Hey, it’s you!* and *Wait, I get to do this again??* She was surprised to wake up again. Daylight in and of itself seemed miraculous. Do you know what that did for me? To learn through her that waking is a privilege again?  My dad died last Friday, her “Pop,” and at 2 and a half, she doesn’t get it. She thinks we all get the miracle of waking up. Every day. She keeps asking when and where we’ll see Pop. I don’t want to rush her to understand; I want her to believe in snow, and guitars, and tigers, and life as long as she can. But eventually she will come to see death as a part of life.  Just like Bulls.  SPY 380P 6/13|2022-06-06 12:16:28

beacpq|v5zgo8|v5zgo8|7|QT doesn't actually start until the 15th. That's when the first treasuries mature and the FED won't reinvest all of it back into bonds. So we should see bonds ripping after that day, and it could create a lot of choppiness, perhaps enough to move the stock market down, but idk, low liquidity market can move massively like that 6% rally we had two weeks ago. The bond market on the 10 year will be the leading indicator, if we pass 3.12% we are in uncharted territories, and you bet people won't bid on the new notes if the FED doesn't pony up higher rates. Value stocks could come into play again and multiple compression hits the QQQ and we test 381 on the SPY. BUT we won't know until the 29th when we get preliminary Q2 GDP data, we could be in a recession from then on. Who’s gonna bag hold?|2022-06-06 13:39:18

belk17|v5zgo8|v5zgo8|6|This is actually getting a little ridiculous. I’m on a hot streak. On my “real” portfolio with 90% of my investment cash, I bought and sold GME from 91 to 120 and LULU 290 to 307. For my little casino fix I do options on RH with like $1000 just for fun. I made about 600% on TSLA puts last week, took out most of the profit, used the rest in SPY calls that I sold this morning and then just bought TSLA calls. Every option I buy or sell tends to move in the direction I want as soon as I trade it.

Yes it took 10 years to recover in 1929 but do you realize that back in the day you didn't even know how your stocks were doing until you got the Sunday paper? The speed of the market was slow.  iPhone came out in 2009 even during the most recent financial crisis people still had to call their broker on the phone to place trades during working hours, virtually nobody had smartphones yet, nobody offered smartphone trading it was in its infancy.   The speed of the market quintupled since then now people can trade hundreds of thousands while sitting on a toilet in minutes! Not only retail but all traders too.  You will never see multiyear bear markets anymore, the speed of the market changed.   Stop looking at past performance or compare charts its pointless.|2022-06-06 12:53:46

If you had told me all of that would happen 3 weeks ago, I'd have assumed SPY would be back at 440+ by now.  This market is completely just flatlining in such an unusual way.  Not really that many historical patterns that match the trading action of the past couple of weeks.  Feels like we're winding up for a big directional move given volume is drying up as well (past 4 days has been declining volume on SPY, assume today will be even lower).

For the last month and a half, every half wit fuckstick with 50 bucks to spend on a put and a cell phone has called themselves “a bear.”    You guys aren’t bears. You’re beggars.  Beggars, begging for a crash every single day for any single reason. This is not the bear way. The way of the bear is to stack and to snipe and then to strike and walk.

We will continue cutting them,” Erdogan said, speaking in Ankara after a weekly cabinet meeting.   The lira extended losses to as much as 0.9% after his comments to near 16.6 per dollar. The currency depreciated 19.8% this year, the worst performance among emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.

bdrk6y|v5zgo8|v5zgo8|2|QT doesn't actually start until the 15th. That's when the first treasuries mature and the FED won't reinvest all of it back into bonds. So we should see bonds ripping after that day, and it could create a lot of choppiness, perhaps enough to move the stock market down, but idk, low liquidity market can move massively like that 6% rally we had two weeks ago. The bond market on the 10 year will be the leading indicator, if we pass 3.12% we are in uncharted territories, and you bet people won't bid on the new notes if the FED doesn't pony up higher rates. Value stocks could come into play again and multiple compression hits the QQQ and we test 381 on the SPY. BUT we won't know until the 29th when we get preliminary Q2 GDP data, we could be in a recession from then on. Who’s gonna bag hold?|2022-06-06 11:25:20

bcrwg9|v5zgo8|v5zgo8|0|“Puts are cheap” .… “The restaurant with notoriously bad reviews and failed health inspections has a lot of availability tonight. Let’s go there instead because it means faster service!”  Bears stop. You don’t recoup your losses by doubling down on failing positions or by continuously buying the opposite way of the short term trend. You hop on the call side for a few hours/days and profit THEN you get puts if you feel it’s necessary then. I see someone of you blow up your accounts for no reason.   You don’t think in a bear market there can be legitimate green days ? Today might be one, use your brains for once. Just because the restaurant has availability doesn’t mean it’s good. You go the extra 5 minutes for quality (money) and then reevaluate after dessert (market close, breaking news stories)  Best of luck today to everyone, let’s play ball!|2022-06-06 06:16:53

bdo3fa|v5zgo8|v5zgo8|3|> I don’t really expect that we will get fireworks at the auction this week. The Fed won’t bid for zero—they own $132bln of securities maturing in June, and they are only trimming $30bln per month from the portfolio, so their bid will likely just be a few billion less in each auction.  >It’s the constant drumbeat of trying to find new money that will be the challenge. The last time around, it was more like watching paint cans explode. But this is the cost of quantitative tightening. If easing is good, then tightening is bad. It can’t be otherwise: if adding liquidity was good but removing it had no impact, then we could have a perpetual money machine by switching between QE and QT. That’s obviously nonsense.  http://www.investing.com/analysis/weekly-inflation-outlook-the-fed-paint-begins-to-dry-200625352|2022-06-06 11:00:34
