7w2ngv|j62ihd|j62ihd|6|RKT is an interesting one. A holding company trying to position itself as the upcoming tech leader for home, title and auto financing. I think a lot of people just own them because 'RKT' is their symbol and Rocket is their name.  The question needs to be asked - what is the benefit of owning all of these services together? It sort of reminds me of GE around 2000 claiming that synergy amongst all of their holdngs will pay big dividends (And we saw how that went).  I know people want to just jump on that fact that interest rates are super low but all of these fields that RKT is involved in are very competitive and all of their competitors are benefiting from the same low interest rates. I think the key to RKT increasing share price showing that their technology and marketing actually capture more market share against their peers.  (For Transparency) I own shares of RKT, am holding long. No options currently held.|2020-10-06 08:01:48

7wgxi8|j62ihd|j62ihd|4|What happens when everyone’s last dime is in the market because we can’t find yield anywhere else?  Maybe we should invest in the real estate asset bubble instead?  Or what about 0% yielding bonds or bonds with yield from companies that will soon file for bankruptcy.  The equities market is a house of cards, but until there is another place for a store of value to go, it is what it is.  Maybe if they shut off the printer there would be a run to the dollar.    My current hypothesis is that there will be a run to the dollar sooner or later even with stimulus.  Because it doesn’t last forever, and if we can’t get low income workers working again, no one is buying stuff and circulation of money (actual inflation) isn’t going to show up.|2020-10-06 10:16:47

7w11jl|j62ihd|j62ihd|5|Why didn’t you guys buy DKNG yesterday? If you bought puts, why? If you follow the NFL you would see that only positive news has come out. No new titans positive. No new patriots positive. Games all successfully rescheduled as byes or to Monday. This thing had crazy momentum and if you watch the stock closely ( which I have ) you would see that when it belongs at a price, It gets there and it gets there quick.   DKNG 65 EOW DKNG 70 next week|2020-10-06 07:43:44

7wxwvy|j62ihd|j62ihd|2|Bets on Apple event, "Hi, Speed"?  I am betting Apple skips an iPhone 'upgrade' and instead unveils an exercise bike called the iSpeed that hooks up with the latest iWatch to track your personal fitness. I predict they're doing this because people can't justify spending money on a new iPhone during a pandemic, but if they're stuck at home they will happily finance an exercise bike so they can "stay in shape" at home.   Source: my ass, and AMD felt like making a bike so maybe APPL is feeling fisky and want to try to undercut PTON. The play? 10/16 PTON strangle in case Tim 🍏 pulls a left field and buys PTON but in the likely event they dump when AAPL announces iSpeed.  Or maybe they just announce the iSpeed which you can inject directly into your forearm.|2020-10-06 12:32:15

Go look at iron ore prices, look at the 1 year chart and max.   https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/iron-ore-price  Look at July through now. Iron ore hasn't been this high since 2014. Vale has earnings on the 22nd. Their expectations are set reasonably high, but they missed Q2. Specific talk surrounding Tesla other EV nickel needs. Even if they don't get into specifics with Tesla on earnings call (which I doubt), they have a reasonably high likelihood of going up.  The October 30th 12C at the moment is basically FD territory price wise and has little risk. Can probably even get out of it for a scalp between now and earnings.  TO VALEHALLA|2020-10-06 06:44:16

7xflbm|j62ihd|j62ihd|1|today, a real trader was born... since april have been trading spreads monthly calls and long calls... after september 4, gained some perspective nd lost some money... started making money on both puts and calls and either buy true leaps(2023) monthlies on faang or fd's on indexes. Today i became acquainted with qqq fd calls. the volume is so high on those calls that you can buy 50 and sell 50 in a heartbeat... its really easy to ride the wave on indexes imo cuz the moves aren't elevators up or down (besides just now lol). I was buying 50 qqq calls for like 12k and make like hundreds in seconds. It was so fun. Almost got caught holding 50 while the dip happened tho lol. I did get caught holding 10 puts I got at the bottom and closed 10 mins later for -1k but given how i usually play and lose in these situations, this is a success! QQQ ALL THE WAY|2020-10-06 14:35:50

7xkdwu|j62ihd|j62ihd|-2|my thought is that the smart money already knew stimmy wasn't happening until after the erection .  so, this drop is either an acknowledgment of blue wave, and thus lower EPS due to higher taxes or  this drop is a recognition that a spiteful Lump will not participate in a stimmy process, and will veto anything that comes his way if he loses erection, which is an increasingly likely outcome given the polls|2020-10-06 15:08:01

7x7evl|j62ihd|j62ihd|-6| I've been deeply thinking about this for a while now. If everyone is buying options, who is buying the stocks, and therefore driving the underlying asset's price higher? What is going on here? Can someone who's familiar with finance please cue me in? I recently purchased 4 contracts of November 11 2020 $100 strike price AMD calls because I read a thread on this subreddit, but I'm not actually buying the stocks right? So who's actually bidding up the price if everyone is in options?|2020-10-06 13:39:30
