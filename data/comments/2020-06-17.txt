"Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy.

We bounce either slightly up or down and you try to sell your options but your brokerage app crashes. By the time it works again, you‚Äòre down at least 10% so you decide to hold. Once you‚Äôre down 20%, you panic sell and the market instantly reverses and heads in the other direction.  source: my trading history|2020-06-17 06:36:14

v4j32h|haof9a|haof9a|9|The edges of your world fade while the radiant figure of Jay fills your vision. He plucks up your still-unlocked phone from a pile of dollars and debris, pushes his glasses up, and reads the screen. Without warning his powerful frame crumples in defeat like an ancient sun giving way to inevitable singularity.   ‚ÄúI am too late.‚Äù he laments in barely more than a whisper.  As if to echo his grief, across America millions of voices cry out in a single unified GUH as their positions approach negative infinity. Then that too fades and all that remains is a broken room, a broken man, and a broken printer.  A reflection of your phone screen remains in his spectacles. Staring back at you in his eyes is the option that brought tragedy and doom to you, to the once great Jay, and to the entire nation. The last thing you see as the coldness reaches your core is that accursed screen:  ‚ÄúWoohoo! üò∫ Your order to buy to open 2 contracts of MSFT $200 call 7/17 has been filled at an average price of $4.20 per contract.

v57wd3|haof9a|haof9a|13|I know "priced in" is a meme, but this is a PSA for anyone who actually believes that anything is priced in - it rarely is. The market was fucking MOONING all through the first 2 MONTHS of grim pandemic news at the beginning of the year. It wasn't until the last possible second that the market reacted to it and the crash was monstrous.  2021 isn't priced in. Future profits aren't priced in. Second wave isn't priced in. Trump winning or losing the election isn't priced in. ZM is at P/E and Hertz flew up hundreds of percent after catastrophic bankruptcy news. If you trade based on "priced in," prepare to get fucked.

v402oc|haof9a|haof9a|32|(reminder post : 2)  #It's your boy chimpu, back with some updates and insights    Indian nifty is looking weak. ,Down 0.3%   Asia having over all a choppy day  Europe holding on to yesterdays gains and are slight green   Nikkie cooled down a bit after yesterday 4%+ dong rally   US futures kind of still holding yesterdays range   #Ranges of spy we will be dealing, 307 being a good support and 315 being resistance.   Introspective bias is that today will be contactionary day rather than expansionary, thus concluding that we will trade between 310 and 314   Personal recomdation : Don't hold derivatives position overnight and look forward to day trade  Small research say this is the season of small profit each trade with many trade   Today follow through is not looking on cards and most probably 2 points will be determined in first hour and we will trade between them through out today   For long term investors : market is still on up trend and vix on down trend when compared to previous month, so it's good time to purchase few stocks for long term, highly recommend SIP strategy to benefit the volitality   In medium term it's likely market might take breather each time NASDAQ touches all time high, so keep an eye on it, personal insight is that Nasdaq might consolidate between 9500 and 10000 for a while and most likely will break upwards, so keep an eye on that   Random tip of the day : '' support your position that is doing good by more funding rather than dollar averaging the one that is doing bad "   Good luck traders and investors, I hope you have a good and profitable day    #It's your boy chimpu, and will be back with more insights and update|2020-06-17 05:54:32

Then, once every one has been grilled, I can leave every one who has a 401K and shit holding their bags full of inflated equity.

v4t49o|haof9a|haof9a|4|**HTZ**  Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has told bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc (HTZ) it has issues with the car rental firm's plan to sell new shares, the agency's Chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC television on Wednesday.  Last week, Hertz won bankruptcy court approval to sell up to $1 billion in stock. It announced on Monday plans to sell up to $500 million in new shares, as it takes advantage of a strong rally in its stock since filing for bankruptcy last month.  Clayton did not elaborate on what the issues were with Hertz's plan, but indicated that the company was unlikely to go through with the offering until those issues were resolved, according to CNBC. (https://cnb.cx/3dax0PJ)  Hertz has warned that its shares would be eventually "worthless", but the stock sale could benefit creditors seeking to recover more of their claims during the bankruptcy process.|2020-06-17 10:55:00

Goldman and Deutsche Bank leading the deal.  CCXX ‚Äî $1.1 billion raise, largest in history. Previously acquired Clarivate Analytics, which is up 100% post acquisition.  Both of these have the potential to be a Virgin Galatic/DraftKings-level deal. Will have to be more patient than with something like OPES or FMCI that is further along in the process.

Tech is packed, no more room in the clown car. Everything else was people telling themselves what they wanted to hear.  Things are going to go back to normal, but not as fast as our short attention span, impatient society wants it to.   Food producers, grocery stores may still have some oomph.

Introspective bias is that today will be contactionary day rather than expansionary, thus concluding that we will trade between 310 and 314   Personal recomdation : Don't hold derivatives position overnight and look forward to day trade  Small research say this is the season of small profit each trade with many trade   Today follow through is not looking on cards and most probably 2 points will be determined in first hour and we will trade between them through out today   For long term investors : market is still on up trend and vix on down trend when compared to previous month, so it's good time to purchase few stocks for long term, highly recommend SIP strategy to benefit the volitality   In medium term it's likely market might take breather each time NASDAQ touches all time high, so keep an eye on it, personal insight is that Nasdaq might consolidate between 9500 and 10000 for a while and most likely will break upwards, so keep an eye on that   Random tip of the day : '' support your position that is doing good by more funding rather than dollar averaging the one that is doing bad "   Good luck traders and investors, I hope you have a good and profitable day    #It's your boy chimpu, and will be back with more insights and update|2020-06-17 09:02:05

As well, there's legitimate proof that Robinhood investors were dumb and naive, which actually sort of adds in a liability component.   I mean it's probably a pipe dream, but the stability of the world economy is sort of being destroyed by the retart/HFT fomo loop.|2020-06-17 13:49:22

Smart motherfuckers with samurai swords and fat wallets played there.  Everybody ran away in March, and at the same time, an army of retards in cargo shorts with the intellectual capacity of first graders and Karens who wrote food blogs no one read for a living ran in, seeing the place abandoned and cavorted their ignorant assholes all over the equipment.    Look at why they did! The hertz table will never be the same.  They destroyed the price discovery table.  There‚Äôs a guy who just shit all over the Boeing booth.  Now those dudes with the wallets are coming back in.  They‚Äôre pissed, and they want the retards money.  The result will be what you would expect when 200 five year olds attack at nazi machine gun nest.

v3ybvk|haof9a|haof9a|21|Today is the first time in my life I'm rooting for Congress Democrats, **Go AOC , take down that boomer JPOW !**  üåàüêª  Edit 1 :  Just in case congress staffers are in this thread, things to ask :  1. How do you feel about QE, since it is   basically a wealth transfer from milllenials and future generations to boomer pension funds. 2. Why don't we print money for pro minority programs 3. Who decides which corporation's bonds we buy. 4. What happens if the corporation default, will the Government be a creditor in a chapter 11 proceedings ?  **Edit 2 : AoC, if you actually manage to do this ...**  I'll move to queens just to vote for you in November.  **Edit 3 : Please also ask from the comment below**  What evidence do you have that QE and buying corporate bonds helps fulfill your mandate to achieve full employment? It took over a decade to do that after the financial crisis.  Why aren't banks lending despite the unprecedented amount of QE?  Why are you buying corporate bonds when the markets are clearly providing enough liquidity?  If the corporate debt markets, which you have stated multiple times are now functioning well, are not comfortable lending to certain companies, what makes you think they are a safe investment for the Fed? If those companies default, is it not the American people who have to pay the Fed for the loss?  **C'mon üåàüêª we can do it, call you congress rep now !**|2020-06-17 05:27:10

You voraciously hold it down as you crane your neck up to gaze back to the screen.   ‚ÄúBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr‚Äù is printed in a pleasantly bland font on an equally bland background. You cannot contain it anymore and a euphoric moan escapes your lips, only to be echoed back at you and redoubled by the voices of your neighbors and indeed the entire American working class as they too all Print. You know it is but a fraction of divinity as compared to Jay as he sits locked upon his Printer Throne. He dedicates the entirety of his almighty JPower to convert the ‚ÄúBrr‚Äù signals into liquid currency to print the USA into safety while kindly reassuring the good people that all is well.

v46xc2|haof9a|haof9a|9|Well guys I think this may be one of my last days. May be up for a few more to lose the rest but I have lost 2900 and now I‚Äôm about to lose another 600 once it opens. I‚Äôll have 700 left to yolo and the chances I make 600% gains are not very likely.  4200 gone is shitty but I enjoyed this. This is gambling. Be careful with your risk tolerance. I was at mine but looking back 4200 could of been my cars brakes or paid off my car loan. RIP|2020-06-17 07:28:01

v52fa1|haof9a|haof9a|1|>Five federal agencies today announced a proposal to change the swap margin rules to facilitate the implementation of prudent risk management strategies at certain banks and swap entities.  >The swap margin rule would no longer require swap entities to hold initial margin for uncleared swaps with affiliates. However, inter-affiliate transactions would still be subject to variation margin requirements. Swap entities regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve Board also would be subject to requirements under sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Board continues to work on proposed amendments to Regulation W that would, among other things, clarify the treatment of bank-affiliate derivatives under sections 23A and 23B.  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191028a.htm  Note: Not new news, but the margin swap that was brought up in the hearing.|2020-06-17 12:10:30

Current curve fit for the infection rate is f(x)=2748e^0.0303x which implies that 10,000 cases will occur in 14 days in the area. Statistically, 10,000 cases is "a milestone (media)," and will probably have all negative pressure hospital rooms occupied (although they can double occupancy if needed).  Hospital beds, vents, and other resources are doing well, but resource managers are going to daily updates from tri-weekly, which suggests some concern.|2020-06-17 12:48:31
