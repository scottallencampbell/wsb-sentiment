In a research note, the investment bank has predicted that S&P 500 index will have fallen by 15% by the summer.  Its new mid-year target for the S&P 500 is 2450 points - compared to 2,882 points last night (and 3,386 back in February!).

k7qlr1|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|32|It's important to not get caught up in any single day's move.  The overall trend is down; we are in a bearish market (even if not technically a bear market yet until S&P hits 2710).  In a bear market, you get extreme 3+% up/down moves regularly, sometimes multiple moves of that magnitude a day as we've seen the past couple of weeks.  Be a nimble trader around these moves, and stay in cash if you don't like any day's move.  Take profit quickly on short-term trades because they can reverse quickly.  Finding the bottom in a bear market is a process; it requires information about the cause of the economic slowdown, which in this case requires more testing data from the CDC/local governments and information about whether the Italy/European shutdowns work to halt the extent of the spread of the coronavirus.  I still think we're 2-3 weeks away from the bottom.  The bottom will occur when markets buy even on bad news related to the coronavirus.  That can admittedly start happening at any time.  It will happen if governments start doing enough to reverse the damage that the coronavirus is causing.  But it also won't happen until we see the real extent of the US spread and whether it's containable in Europe.  This is still 2-3 weeks away in all likelihood.  Once the US reaches max acceleration in case growth, that's really where I expect to see a bottom.  But again, nobody knows when that is.|2020-03-11 10:49:06

My only advice is to cut your losses and don't be ashamed or afraid to ask for help, even if it's reaching out to your fellow autists. I got crushed last fall chasing losses after CRM had their earnings call early and wrecked me. First people to reach out were people here. Messages, comments, all that. Since then, I've tried to pay that forward because it meant a lot at the time.    ‚Ä¢ This is real life and this is real money, yes. We all know a thing or two about risk. That said, COVID19 is positioned to fuck us all with a Theta crush. Don't take your physical well-being or that physical well-being of your loved ones for granted: take care of yourselves.   That's it.   TL;DR: wash your fucking hands, take a deep breath.   0327 SPY 275P|2020-03-11 13:46:37

k7n0wl|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|14|I think the downside to this market is really tremendous. Trump & Co are fucking up the coronavirus response, and it spreads at an exponential rate if kept unchecked. The promising containment figures coming out of S Korea, Italy, and even China come from extraordinary measures like widespread testing and broad lock-downs/quarantines. We are so decentralized here, and so stubborn about muh freedoms, that neither of those strategies are going to scale well.  We haven't been testing so we have no idea how many cases are actually out there, which makes it impossible to know how quickly it's about to spread. Based on reported figures, we're going to have at least 10K cases next week, then 100K the next week, then 1 million by April 1st if we don't get our shit together. Continued exponential growth after April 1 (to, yes, 10 million by April 8) is a non-negligible probability falling in the fat tail of the distribution of potential outcomes. But even if it doesn't get that high, April is on track to be a complete clusterfuck.|2020-03-11 10:15:52

k75luj|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|8|Don't get too caught up in the pre-market moves (yes I know they have a huge impact on option valuations lol).  Right now, markets are just unsure of how to price the US coronavirus situation because so little testing has been done that the real spread of the virus is a complete unknown.  You can basically make up any number from 1000 to 20000 and guess it's the real number of cases in the US.  That's why we're seeing such extreme volatility pre-market the past 2 weeks.  I still think we test S&P 2710, and we might just keep bouncing off that as algs try to buy anywhere near bear market levels.  The big events that matter are the Fed meeting next week and what the numbers start to look like next week as broader testing is done.  Markets could panic despite the incoming Fed rate cut if the US starts adding 1k+ cases per day to the coronavirus count.|2020-03-11 07:06:17

k843ae|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|7|Here's some DD for you dirt bats. Guess who has been increasingly heavy in equities the last couple years. Fucking pension funds. Billions of dollars in old fuckers monthly payments are based on stonks always going up. Well guess what, those stonks just tanked 15-20% in 2.5 fucking weeks. None of those crusty old boomers controlling hundreds of billions of tendies had any time to unload that shit at the initial drop and they probably thought it was only a minor correction. Now the further this shit drops, the more funds start to unload equities for cash and you get massive selling.... so downies. And what else are pension funds investing in. Those stupid BBB corporate bonds that banks still get away with offering with high yields that are filled with absolute SHIT. And guess what's being unloaded right now. Those shit bonds. And the further they fall, the more obvious it becomes that they're filled with shit. Go look at what's happening with LQD right now. Most of those corporate bonds are increasingly likely to be downgraded into liquid shit. This is happening throughout the economer. Buy PUTS. Short Boomers|2020-03-11 12:49:41

At the moment the ask for a monthly (4/17) ATM call is $16 but for a two year call it‚Äôs $32... wow. Shows the sentiment!  I‚Äôll try to buy more if we see 240-250 or if it seems like the bottom is actually in. I want prices to reflect a clear bottom though so I don‚Äôt know which will end up the better deal - I‚Äòm lousy at timing so I expect I‚Äôll be a bit late to that party.|2020-03-11 13:21:01

k883c2|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|4|The most important tech stock right now is SHOP imo.  SHOP works with small businesses, so if there's really going to be any sort of recession that harms small businesses the most, they'll be on the front lines taking the biggest impact, at least theoretically.  Yet SHOP is holding up very well; they've basically only given up their 2020 gains.  I don't know if it's a case of investors hoping that the impact is just temporary or that businesses won't cut that spending specifically, but it's interesting to see it holding up this well.  I thought all last year that if we end up in a recession that SHOP would be down to around $200.  Clearly so far at least, markets aren't selling heavily.  (Yes, I know it's down $40 today, but this is still just retracing gains from when the markets went vertical at end of 2019).|2020-03-11 13:25:34

k7g18d|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|11| Mods won't approve my post so I'll put it here.  Since most autists on this sub thinks repos are just JPow pumping the markets up with funny money I decided to make a post to explain it.  Repurchase agreements aka repos are agreements that the Fed enters with banks to make sure that there is enough in reserves/liquidity for banks to continue to loan money to businesses or customers. These loans are paid back the next day or within a period of time shorter than 2 weeks in most cases. When done once in a very long while these are no big deal as the bank keeps money flowing and the Fed makes money off the interest from the short term loan.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements)  Since September 2019 we have engaged in the only large scale, long lasting repo effort since 2008/2009. The link below shows the rate of repurchase agreements in that time. This indicates that banks do not have enough liquidity to do day to day lending and we are moving towards a liquidity crisis unseen since the last recession.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WORAL#0](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WORAL#0)  Do we avoid this? Maybe with smart policy, luck on the CV front and an OPEC+ agreement. If those things don't happen we may see the Fed lower rates to 0, engage in full on QE and start to assume toxic assets to brunt a possible collapse. - All speculation but it's my guess if CV hits hard and OPEC+ dig in on this production surge.  **TL;DR: Repos are not JPow sending the markets to the moon with newly minted cash, they're to prevent our banking system and the businesses that rely on it from collapsing.**  Editing one of my comments from the WAYMT Thread:  Since interest rates are so low and the markets were doing so well, CFOs wouldn't be doing their fiduciary requirements if they didn't take loans to maximize their share holder value and do stock buy backs, sending the price higher. This has created a bubble of basically free money and increasing value. The interest rate on this debt is so low that if the market was outperforming that interest rate, the companies can make more money off of leveraging that debt. This has led to the highest levels of corporate debt ever.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BCNSDODNS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BCNSDODNS)  If we collapse too hard without thorough government intervention, companies will start to default on their interest payments and the largest corporate credit bubble in history may burst. I don't think Trump and the Fed will let that happen but we're being hit with the 1-2 combination of a demand/supply chain issue from CV and cheap oil kneecapping energy.|2020-03-11 09:07:58

But it wont let me, saying I need to deposit tendies to do so. Hmmm. Maybe this work around was fixed? OH well. Robinhood diamond hands engaged!    I already have 3 day trades, kinda want to lock in this 50% gain on BAC puts. If not I'll just diamondhand hold these bitches til tomorrow.

k7a87j|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|-7|Did my option purchase go through on Robinhood?  I put in an order last night, just after the market closed for the day.  This morning I checked to see if it went through and where it says "Upcoming Activity" it says my put buy is "Placed".  Does that mean I have it or because the price changed so much it is waiting until there actually is a seller at the price I listed?|2020-03-11 08:04:57

k8wsqc|fgvdtv|fgvdtv|-8|Hopefully you guys are willing to answer some of the questions I had as a beginner;  Recommended reads to gain better understanding of all the topics, mainly options since that's what I see here a lot.  I've opened an account with the broker DeGiro which is a Dutch broker, I've seen the talk about Robinhood, but it's not available here. Since I see that many options/calls/puts traded here are SPY, how would I be able to trade something similar (Unless I'm wrong I don't think you can buy SPY options here, only stocks).  Are options even recommended to start with, since it can be seen as gambling, or should I start with something slower and less risky(?) such as stocks/shares.  Are there any platforms I should use or just stick with the platform the broker offers  Do you guys have tips you'd wish you'd knew or can give me when you first started this journey. I'm still young, don't have kids etc. so I got plenty of "free" time next to my study.  Thanks.|2020-03-11 17:06:00
