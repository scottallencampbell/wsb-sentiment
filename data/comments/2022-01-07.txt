Over the last 23 days, GOOGL has been either flat or green in pre-market.   &#x200B;  Of those 23 days, from open to 11:00 am:     20 of those days, GOOGL then **drops** an average of **34.31** points.     1 of those days is a push (i.e., 11:00 am price is the same as open).     1 of those days is 48 points green, but closes the day flat.  1 of those days is 41 points green, and finishes the day green.     In other words, if you would have bought GOOGL puts every day at open over this time, and closed out at 11:00 am, you would have profited 87%, broke even 4%, and lost 9%.....even though GOOGL finished 10 of those days green.|2022-01-07 06:17:39

rnct3w|ry4xff|ry4xff|370|The purpose of a moderator is really to just get out of people's way and empower them to have fun.   A big part of that is creating rules that ensure interesting and relevant content gets the attention it deserves.  But it takes a lot of time and effort to create that content, which is why it is critical that users have trust in that their content won't get unfairly or opaquely removed.   So comments like the following from zjz that are followed up by banwaves are unacceptable.  > I just went through and removed most of the GME shit, highly upvoted or not. I'm not doing this again. Fuck you apes. You treated us all like shit and turned into a band of conspiracy douchebags. Stay in your subreddit.  This was a clear violation of the trust you put in us to apply rules fairly. Content that did not violate any rules was being removed. For that reason, I chose to remove u/zjz and u/visualmod.   The next day or so may be a little choppy in terms of moderation, but I appreciate your patience. I hope people will not take this issue out on people who trade differently than themselves.  Edit: To be clear, this does not mean we will tolerate low quality content or users that intentionally crowd out others. Nor will we allow content to completely dominate for prolonged periods of time.  Edit 2: Spam bots are back up. Still have a lot of work to do to rebuild the fun features we had and make them even better.|2022-01-07 09:44:35

Their business is sticking around only issue is pubmatic as a competitor is gaining ground. But there's still alot of opprtunity in a growing market. Think the company top line is not growing as much as inevstors like but a growth ad tech company that actually makes money?

roj89i|ry4xff|ry4xff|7|GME....WAS  an all time play. No guarantees that it's going to remain that way.  There's much more at work in the general market than what Stonkers focus on for confirmation bias. They very well could be right.  But what we're witnessing now is a changing situation with The Federal Reserve and the deterioration of growth stocks and companies with risky fundamentals.  This includes GME.  So as this year plays out yes a squeeze is possible if you believe the short interest is still high enough. But the chances are much higher playing it from $5 to nearly $400 was the play and now we're just witnessing a HODL cult hoping they can cash in again.  With that much capital hypertargeted they could accomplish so much else. Even companies with higher short interest now.

ro7s9m|ry4xff|ry4xff|1|Did any of you actually read the full statement? No wonder it rocketed so hard.  >GRAPEVINE, TX¬†Jan 6, 2022¬†/PRNewswire/ -- Gamestop Corp. (NYSE:¬†$GME) (the "Squeeze" or "MOASS") announced today¬†that it has entered the framework agreement to bring Cryptocurrency and NFT's into its future plans for revitalization of the core businesses. With that announcement GME expects pool of rigs will be able to generate about 177 Ph/S for mining bitcoin, 356 Gh/S for mining ethereum  >To power such a facility GME entered a framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower Station ("Leibodong") in Hejiang, Luzhou,¬†Sichuan Province, where hydropower resources are much richer and electricity prices much lower than the rest part of¬†China. Pursuant to the agreement, Leibodong will supply¬†GME with electricity to its cloud crypto mining and big data center. Leibodong is located in Dazuoba village,¬†Fubao Town, Hejiang County, Luzhou,¬†Sichuan Province.   >It is a level three cascade hydropower station of Dacao River Basin of Tang River, the first-level tributary of the upper Yangtze River. The normal water level of Leibodong is¬†560m, with the function of daily adjustments. Its adjustment capacity is 1.57 million m3. The actual installed capacity of the power station is 25000 KW, the average annual power generation is 99.8 million KW / h.  >Pursuant to the agreement, Leibodong will supply electricity to a cloud crypto mining center to be built by GME or a price between 0.22-0.38kW/h.¬†The parties will enter into definitive agreement with respect to the price and other terms and conditions contemplated by the framework agreement. Gamestop expects the first shipment of crypto mining machine will be installed on or about¬†Feb. 14, 2022.¬†  >**Newly hired GME Chairman Yandai Wang commented, "one of the key success factors for cloud crypto mining is to secure cheap power in regions with rich renewable energy resources,.¬†Southwest China, such as¬†Sichuan¬†province, is one of such regions. GME will continue to search for cheap and sustainable electricity to execute its aspiring cloud crypto mining¬†strategy."**¬†¬†|2022-01-07 12:49:34

rpp5ui|ry4xff|ry4xff|1|Hello apes, this is Barry McCaulkiner from Citadel's risk assessment department. The boss went crazy today. He berated me in front of the whole staff. He doesn't understand how so many people can be so faithful to GME. He grabbed me by the lapels and shook me demanding to know what an NFT is. He slapped me and spit in my mouth. He made me shit the entire boards cum into a martini glass and drink it after. Then he made me short more shares.        Good news, he's almost defeated. If we can all hold out a little bit longer, they'll go bankrupt and need to sell all assets to buy GME.

They benefit from the SPREAD (NII) that occurs as the market adjusts to them.  They pay depositors the short yield and lend at the long.  In fact, the first few hikes can actually hurt their earnings.  Insurers on the other hand benefit immediately since they have to purchase debt to asset-liability match float with reserves.  Much of it has to be safe government debt as well.  They stand to benefit right away from hikes.   How to play them ---> life and health you can buy right away many of them are excellent.  P&C with climate risk, might be worth waiting until this winter passes.  It is expected to be unusually cold, a really bad storm can fuck them up.|2022-01-07 09:03:29

romv55|ry4xff|ry4xff|-6|AXSM's time in the thirties is almost over. No, not the twenties. Yes, the forties, and even the fifties are upcoming very soon. Maybe as soon as Monday. Maybe as soon as after hours today, once the co. announces all manufacturing issues are resolved.  This is one of the greatest trade opportunities I've ever witnessed. Anyone who knows me knows I despise lies. I don't lie. I don't deceive.  I minsister to people using the Bible, especially the Old Testament as my guide. But one of my favorite quotes is from the New Testament, "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"  It's not worth it to me to lie to you and make some money if it means standing before God and explaining to Him about all the stuff I bought because of it. I can't take any of it with me when I go before our Holy King.  Honestly, I've been trading since the nineties. I was a licensed broker for a while. I traded for myself for a while. Managed a business and owned one overseas. The truth is, back in 2001, the greatest trade of my life was told to me, MYR Group was going to be bought out. I knew the secratary to the CFO. That was a great trade. Buying AXSM right here, right now, in my opinion is the second most certain trade of my market experience.  All the clues are laid out for you to read for yourself, from August 09, which created this great opportunity, to October 12, when the co. began listing jobs to sell AXS 05, then soon after when they got a credit line increase, November 09, when it was revealed there were issues with manufacturing, which is why the FDA did not approve AXS 05 on August 22, but didn't reject it... because the trials and data were so awesome. The drug was granted fast track review before the manufacturing concerns crept up. But that's the beauty, the gem of it all. That's an easy fix. I'm pretty sure there are lots of folks out there that know how to make a pill.  So now we have a $100 stock trading at $33.00.  Please, if I'm wrong,  somebody show me how or why.  Good luck     And some schmuck downvotes me just because the post is longer than his attention span can absorb. Brilliant.|2022-01-07 14:22:18
