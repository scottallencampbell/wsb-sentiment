ekcg5j|ephwka|ephwka|3|In case you want to play CSX     Top-line growth remains challenged for CSX, but productivity initiatives continue to drive bottom-line gains. The railroad was able to surpass our September-period call of $1.05 a share, thanks to additional efficiency gains related to the implementation of the Precision Scheduled Railroading model. The operating ratio improved by nearly 200 basis points year over year, to 56.8% (lower is better). Revenue fell slightly more than we anticipated, due to declines in the intermodal and coal businesses. While sales in the intermodal unit were down about 11% from the prior year, the railroad's decision to cut back on certain corridors probably played a role in the lack of shipments. Meanwhile, the company generated roughly 15% more free cash flow in the third quarter versus last year, as it made fewer capital investments and produced stronger margins. The demand outlook is likely to remain soft heading into 2020. The agricultural,  coal, and intermodal spaces may well experience weakness for a variety of reasons. The trade tensions between the U.S. and China are a big factor, as well as a slower global economy. In the intermodal market, trucking pricing has loosened over the last several quarters, as well. Lower natural gas prices and weaker export demand ought to weigh on the coal franchise. We have reduced our 2020 earnings target by $0.15 a share, due to a lower revenue assumption. Margins may well expand slightly more than we previously expected, thanks to the PSR strategy. This neutrally ranked stock holds below-average capital appreciation potential over the 2022-2024 investment horizon. However, the equity has the highest free cash flow yield of all railroads, and is trading at a discount to its peer group. In addition, should volumes surprise to the upside in 2020, we believe the company will significantly benefit from a reduced cost structure and  a lower capital spending budget, which ought to allow for a greater return of capital to shareholders. All told, on a relative basis CSX, is worth a consideration for buy-and-hold investors looking for exposure to the railroad sector. Michael Collins, CFA November 22, 2019|2020-01-16 11:52:26

Bought Jan 24 $116 calls for 1.38, juuuust as it went under $116. Sold like 40 min later at 1.70   23%  Then it dipped down again and I bought the same calls at 1.46 and sold at 1.65   13%   I'd feel more like a degenerate if I'd lost money the second time, or if I had put more money in.|2020-01-16 14:48:26

The PEG is at 1.8, anything over 1.0 is considered overvalued.  ‚ÄúThe S&P 500 is running on fumes,‚Äù Bank of America equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian said in a note to clients Thursday.  Also let's talk about that 18.4 price to earnings ratio. Set aside for a moment what your positions are, bullish or bearish. Imagine the stock market is a brand new thing that just got invented. And I am asking you to buy shares, but the price I'm asking you to pay is not what that chunk of the company is worth TODAY, but rather what it will MAYBE be worth 18.4 years from today, if all goes according to plan. How fucking retarded of a rip off does that sound to you? You have to pay 18.4 times what the share will even make you in a year.|2020-01-16 12:28:19
