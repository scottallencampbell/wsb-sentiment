war1ow|n11379|n11379|6|If you reconcile the numbers from Paysafe's SEC-filed investor and analyst presentations, you can see that prior to a stagnant 2020 due to Covid, they reported a strong 27% CAGR which is on par with high profile competitors:  2017: $864 million rev 2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%) 2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%). 2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)  Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, ‚Äúexited low value referral channels‚Äù and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.  Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:  ‚ÄîVisa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%) ‚Äî Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)  Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with valuation comps from fintech sector peers.|2021-04-29 09:15:29

GOEV crossed an important resistance line at the end of yesterday, and higher forecasts posted.  The lawsuit is bullshit.    If SAVA hits the mid 48.50 with momentum, it will fly.  Same price as the offering (over two months ago).  $58 is my first PT.    Keep a close eye on the 10 year yield.  If it stay down, we could have a monster day trading Thursday.

But their average age is 21. And if you're going to say "I told you so," where your positions at? Where are those juicy puts you keep talking about?  I'm all about shit-talking.

wbfmbm|n11379|n11379|12|The strategy that seems to work:  When a stock first starts getting hyped on WSB, and I mean in the first day or so, buy and hold for a day or 2 and sell for 5% - 15% profit. By the time the stock goes up 5% - 10% it's too late to buy in. Don't be greedy, I learned that the hard way. Take your modest profits and dip. Ignore all "it's gonna squeeze!!!" and "only paper handed bitches sell" posts.  It seems HFs are actively hyping stocks only to pull the rug after millions buy in. Either that or they see which stocks are gaining momentum and use it to their advantage knowing many found WSB after all the publicity and have no trading experience.|2021-04-29 12:05:37

wblbmx|n11379|n11379|4|I am becoming more bearish on tech. I believe the semiconductor shortage is far worse than we are currently priced in for, even with the new guidance from many companies like Ford estimating a 50%+ production cut this year due to semiconductor shortage.  The shortage is not just from increased demand. Taiwan is the worlds leading semiconductor foundry. Their foreign minister recently shared that their semiconductor industry is being targeted by China through cyber and economic warfare. He also said there is risk of a full Chinese invasion of Taiwan (less likely imo).  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/16/2-charts-show-how-much-the-world-depends-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors.html  Within the last two years seven leading Taiwanese semiconductor companies have been targeted by cyberattacks that have created persistent backdoors.  https://cyware.com/news/operation-skeleton-key-chimera-hacker-group-targets-taiwanese-semiconductor-manufacturers-81090445  Now Taiwan is being pressured by China and it is crippling the already overwhelmed semiconductor industry.  > Efforts by Taiwan's government to stave off what China refers to as inevitable unification are like ‚Äúa mantis trying to stop a chariot," Wu said.  The U.S. maintains only unofficial relations with Taiwan in deference to Beijing, but provides the island with defensive weapons and is legally bound to treat threats to it as matters of ‚Äúgrave concern." Increased activity by the Chinese military around Taiwan has been raising concern about the possibility of a conflict. In an interview with Britain's Sky News, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu reiterated recent warnings that the military threat from China is growing through ‚Äúmisinformation campaigns, hybrid warfare, and ... grey zone activities." ‚ÄúAnd all these seem to be preparing for their final military assault against Taiwan,‚Äù Wu told Sky. ‚ÄúThis is our country, this is our people and this is our way of life. We will defend ourselves to the very end," Wu said. https://news.yahoo.com/amphtml/china-says-us-increasing-military-101437628.html|2021-04-29 12:36:38

Not just the new guys, I‚Äôd argue that the noobs are actually better positioned than legacy, that‚Äôs a whole other discussion. My main point being that everyone seems to acts like it‚Äôs just a matter of putting batteries and e-engines in a car. False, these companies have to build it from the ground up. Therefore legacy auto makers are scrambling to come to market. We all know what happens when legacy automakers scramble right? MISTAKES,RECALLS,LAWSUITS.   I‚Äôm not saying this can‚Äôt happen to EV companies also, but which would you rather have? A hungry younger company focused on growth and their future? Or a old slow ‚Äúsludge in the pipes‚Äù legacy company, that is both trying to wind down their ICE production and ramp up their EV production?(aka burning the candle at both ends). That being said, I have holdings in both legacy and newer companies. I think there is room for the bigger legacy makers and a handful of new companies. I just think this idea of legacy car makers crushing the likes of TSLA, NIO, XPEV, and others is just complete disinformation.
