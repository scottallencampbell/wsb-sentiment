jq1n8i|kzsjo9|kzsjo9|8|My theory is Softbank, and others, saw the power retail + WSB had. It got exploited and it was epic. The options buying was unprecedented and when it was directed to FAANG it was a sight to behold.   But it led to consequences. We all saw how vicious September was. Just no catalyst other than the market rolling out of control. Historically those CAN get worse. Not every market crash in history needed a black swan event. Just for shit to get fundamentally unstable. We still don't exactly even know 100% what caused the biggest global one day crash in history for example. Just the right market conditions.  So maybe August- September freaked some folks out. Softbank got the memo to chill a bit. Then..whether by design or coincidence you get FAANG to trade sideways for just 6 months. Options buying slows from retail on the world's biggest companies. Even TSLA.  What happens? Instead all that power gets directed to fucking meme stocks one by one. RKT, NIO, PLTR,  and now GME.  When whales feed WSB and others we had the power to pump gamma and **MOVE** indexes. Now we just wonder how long before GME either squeezes or fails to hold $30 through a vicious correction.  Either way, the big boys get what they want. We got neutralized.|2021-01-18 08:42:34

jqrpwm|kzsjo9|kzsjo9|11|Two probabilities:  1. Market continues to melt up until bears completely capitulate and buy in. (You'll know it's time when the bears on Twitter are all saying they've gone long. That is your signal.) These are the last buyers (bears buy the top) and the market will have nowhere to go but down. Momentum trading algos and retail panic will hasten the crash, probably beyond what we're used too, and stock prices will eventually revert to the mean. Cash gang can make a fortune in this scenario if they are patient, but they too will have capitulated.   ..or..   2. The market rises endlessly on government financed debt. There is no earnings or "recovery" narrative that can justify these valuations, so in this scenario, the liquidity spigot can simply never be shut off. We're looking at UBI, debt jubilees, inflation, (probably stagflation), and nowhere to turn for yield, ever, except steadily rising assets. The extremely wealthy will became even richer because they hold the assets. The poor will struggle to pay for housing and basic goods, even with stimulus.   These are my thoughts on it. Positions: 50% cash until we touch the yearly 5 EMA, GLD, SLV, ICLN (Leaps). I'm also holding GME shares because aren't we all?|2021-01-18 12:25:28

jqn0n0|kzsjo9|kzsjo9|15|Who is in for the GameStop stimulus challenge?  When my wife and I received our latest round of stimulus checks... $1200 total, we opened up an additional investing account and bought GME at 17.51.  We were lucky on the timing.  Full disclosure... I’m a boomer and bought in before RC at an initial buy of $4.50.  I have since reloaded many more times.    I wanted to see what Uncle Sam would buy me.  My $1200 is going to buy me a F350 truck.  So here goes, every 6 months, I will report and provide an update until Uncle Sam buys me my dream truck.  Maybe this seems silly or stupid, but we live in some really crazy times.  What a story that would be.  I know many of you degenerates would agree with me... what will Uncle Sam buy you when you embrace the GameStop stimulus challenge?|2021-01-18 11:47:41

Like if you have $50k invested altogether are you willing to see it go to $20k on the dips and have faith that you will still make money in the long run? Assuming that you are not buying the dips forever.   My loss percentage threshold before I panic sell everything to stop the bleeding is like 20%.

Worried about ticket revenue going down and money it costs to keep theaters open? It’s going to happen anyways. Give a discount to subscribers to go to theaters. Easy peasy.

jpvtg1|kzsjo9|kzsjo9|1|Let’s talk PLUG. Hold, buy or sell?  Two billion dollar joint ventures internationally, a US Walmart contract, an incoming green friendly government, 10/11 analysts rating it as a buy, comments widely saying it’s the best pure play for the hydrogen industry.  Elon thinks Hydrogen is stupid... maybe it’s not as convenient to “refuel” as electric for personal consumer use (charging at home vs the cost of extracting Hydrogen), but it’s also competition for Elon, and it makes a lot of sense for semi trucks and long range vehicles, mail trucks, etc. A lot of the existing Oil/gasoline industry infrastructure and distribution can be modified to hydrogen.  On the downside, they just had a hugely enthusiastic run. We saw market forces cause a pullback, and Thursday and Friday, we saw prices dropping along with the rest of the market. Our European friends are saying the stock went even lower today, which would really hurt me (been saving for a house down payment, just put in a bid yesterday). Apparently, it’s still trading well above earnings (someone better at DD please help!).  I thought hydrogen was cool since doing a 2005 tech symposium presentation on it (one of many young teams just graduated from highschool making tech presentations), and I thought we’d have hydrogen cars after 12 years. Seems like it’s finally breaking through the tech and industry resistance. I feel they have some big customers and will increase profits more and more in the long run, and even just 2021 will be a big year for them. In the short run, with respect to the personal issue of trying to move into a house, I’m worried how long I can hold the stocks before I’m forced to sell and lose most of my January gains (because I invested more money on the dip).  What do you guys think? Am I a worm? So far holding tough based on long term prospects, but more data is welcome.|2021-01-18 07:40:19

I wouldn't be able to sleep at night with a large position in either lol.   Seriously concerning that someone can't find a better opportunity than DirecTV right now with a boat load of money, isn't it? Even if their bid was low, why such blind faith that they're going to make a great pick?  VTIQ/NKLA still fresh in my mind, SPAC's DD leading them to merge with a company lead by a fraud cousin-molesting mormon without any tech worth a damn, nepotistic hiring of concrete-laying brother into leadership position. Tons of damage to the Nikola brand thanks to Trevor, might become a legitimate company with lots of hard work from the people in charge now but either way, it sure looked like a complete shit show as a result of poor DD pre-merger. How is it acceptable to be so bad at DD at the head of an SPAC with investors' money?  Wish this sub wasn't so full of shills getting away with believing their bet is free money and stating it as such. Confidence is contagious - real people with a dollar in their pockets and a dream potentially betting money they shouldn't based on the things said. Yeah sure maybe they deserve the lesson, but if the quality of the plays shilled goes up, wsb market influence grows and takes on less risk and we'd all make more money.  Diversify people, that one play you're all in on probably isn't free money. The stock would have already mooned if it was, because people privy to insider information or with more knowledge and capital would've already pushed it there. Maybe the CCIV lucid rumor pans out, but it wasn't free money, you took a big risk on a rumor and it could work out.

jqf7aw|kzsjo9|kzsjo9|-8|Ok super newb retarded question that I just need confirmation if I am right or not here.   First, I use Robinhood so we can already assume I'm pretty autistic and fully retarded. But I have a total of 35k in GME. It looks like 17,500 is my own money and 17,500 is on margin. Now I have the funds to cover the 17,500 in margin but it's not in my Robinhood account yet. The money is clearing my bank account Tuesday and I will start the transfer of 20k probably Wednesday.    My question is, how can I pay off my 17,500 in margin?  I can't find a way to just make this happen. It looks like my only outlet is to sell all my shares. Turn off marching. Then rebuy back in. Which would suck if during this time I miss the squeeze. It would also suck because I'd have to sell all my shares on margin that are invested in other stocks as well as you cannot turn it off until it's all paid back   Or if I have the 17,500 cleared in my Robinhood account should I not even worry about it since I'll have the funds to cover?   Tl;Dr:. A new retard who is wondering how you can pay off margin on Robinhood without closing all margin positions then turning the feature off and buying back in.|2021-01-18 10:44:29
