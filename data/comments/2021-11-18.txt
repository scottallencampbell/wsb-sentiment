l54fpq|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|7|The line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and clear, becomes blurred still further when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs. Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities - that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future - will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There’s a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands.|2021-11-18 11:10:57

Feels like a buyable dip if you're thinking long term and not buying stuff up 30% in the past month.

l3ztvq|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|17|Why the fuck does the SEC make it sooooo hard for the common man to invest in pre-IPO companies?   You can only invest in pre-IPO companies if you're an 'accredited investor', which means you basically need to have an income over $200k+ for several years at a minimum, a combined income over $300k+ with a spouse, or a net worth over $1M that excludes the value of your home.  You can't even use a site like equityzen to invest in pre-IPO shares unless you're basically rich as shit.  The SEC wants to make sure the poors and common man cannot have access to pre-IPO investments like rich people do who often cash in and get gigantic returns when companies IPO. What the fuck is the point of these barriers to entry?  Yet the SEC lets some college kid making $9/hr picking his nose while working his on campus job to invest in options strategies like box spreads through Robinhood. WTF.|2021-11-18 05:57:29

They have spent the last 5 years building the Omniverse and have just succeeded in essentially becoming a full stack company.   That means they make the chips, the servers, and the software for AI. This AI “omniverse” is their dream and theyve realized it. They charge $1,000 per “user” or “avatar”.   That avatar is an AI simulation. So if you have a self driving car, which they are going to make available for any and every car manufacturer, $1,000 a year. If you have a simulated AI taking orders at your drive thru… $1,000 a year.   In the future their goal is to have 100% of internet traffic touching a GPU. They have demonstrated their AI Omniverse product can achieve AI processing speeds up to one million times greater than before.   They said in earnings call this gives them up to 100million potential new customers at $1,000 a year. The technology has been built. They’re using it right now. They’re simulating cities, factory floors for productions, cars for self driving, human avatars for fluid language interfaces… etc.   Their earnings call guided revenue up almost 1 billion more than expected. And theyre set for massive growth in the future for AI, while ALSO still growing their gaming GPU and server supply business by up to 50-60% a year.   So dont get those puts bro.|2021-11-18 06:46:36

Now you know why you don't invest in hype- people are fickle and hype always goes away, usually pretty quick. If you bought at IPO you're still up, now is a good exit point to not become a future bagholder. If you bought at $175, well I just hope you learned your lesson.    I'm sure plenty of people got close to calling the top or just generally had a decent exit point, and made good money on it. But the cold hard truth is that most retail investors that bought into RIVN are still holding and losing money.|2021-11-18 11:25:12

l57qiu|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|2|Pretty new to this, so maybe a dumb question. Does it make sense to have calls and puts at the same time?  Let’s say SPY for example. If I buy a 470 call for 12/31 and a 468 Put for 12/31, and just wait for a week where spy goes up to sell the call, and wait for a week where SPY goes down to sell the put, is there anything I’m not seeing that would make that a bad idea?|2021-11-18 11:32:30

The 52-week low is $14.94, the 52-week high is $43.00 (but you may as well ignore the high, go look at the chart).  Anyway, it will probably be $18.xx in a few months. $15.15 to $18.00 is a \~ 19% return.   Average market return over time is 10%, not factoring-in inflation. So I'm good with 19% in three months or so.  $30B market cap. PE ratio of 5.00. Nobody in WSB will buy any. Have a great day.|2021-11-18 11:11:59

Why their stock is pumping, no idea. People that can't read I guess. Or it's everyone that likes burning money anytime they hear EV said about a company.

When FSD does arrive, it will be because software companies that have focused on the effort bring it to life.  This will be due to efforts of Waymo, Apple and Cruise.  At that point, Tesla will just be stamping metal and putting cars together.  True manufacturers will be forced to license true FSD.    People who buy FSD from Tesla are fools, but their money is pure margin, so why not gaslight them?|2021-11-18 13:37:10

l483o1|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|1|Do not buy shares of Sweetgreen (SG) in today's IPO.  Sweetgreen (SG) is expected to go public on November 18, 2021 with a midpoint valuation of $24/share, which would earn the stock an unattractive rating.   I do not think investors should expect to make any money in Sweetgreen stock if the expected valuation comes true. A $24/share valuation implies Sweetgreen’s revenue will grow 8x 2020 levels and faster than Chipotle in its first 10 years after going public.   **I think the stock is likely worth $0 given the company’s limited differentiation and the intense competition from other new entrants and established restaurants, which are easily replicating Sweetgreen’s menu and concept.**   Despite its large online presence, Sweetgreen lost market share in 2020 to stronger, better-positioned competitors. Sweetgreen’s locally-sourced supply chain adds safety risks and hurts the company’s ability to achieve the economies of scale that more vertically integrated restaurants enjoy.

Is there a compelling Bull case for Novavax to convince me to stick with it long term?  I’ve been underwater on NVAX much of the year while Moderna has been very good to me. If I sell today I’ll probably break even.   I’m also very disappointed that Novavax has failed (again) to bring something to market in the US. I was hoping for a joint COVID/Flu annual vaccine from them, but I haven’t heard anything to suggest that’s on the near horizon.   MRNA: $251.80 Revenue: $11.83B P/E $14.86 EPS: $16.31 52 Week Low vs High: $88.61 - $497.49  NVAX: $190.70 Revenue: $1.20B P/E: $— EPS: $-14.81 52 Week Low vs High: $85.62 - $331.68  Position: 30 NVAX and 46 MRNA|2021-11-18 12:08:41

Parabolic in gold could mean 50% gain which doesn't seem appetizing but when everything else like real estate and the market drops 50% you'll have a lot of buying power to scoop up the depressed equities for the next run.      If gold was properly valued in comparison to gold in the 70's 80's, it should be 20K or so right now.

l5vdbm|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|-5|People do realize that if Weed is legalized fully nationwide it will create excess competition, remove cost barriers for growing conditions, and the prices would crater.  Right?  Like, they'd make less profit than the cig companies who are barely going anywhere, not much upside, if any.  The belief that mass money would come in with legalization and send specifically weed stocks flying outside an initial bump is hilarious at best. A good chunk of major state growers aren't even public, now they and the smaller ones would have no restrictions.  How much money could Tilray possibly make in a race to the bottom in prices, $5?  It's a long term disaster for weed stocks.  I get the logic, that more weed means more money from people to buy it, but there are two issues with this, first, not everyone wants weed and it'll never be more popular than cigs.   Secondly, you aren't considering who is getting the money. Some of these are just other category companies that also decide to sell weed, that doesn't really put money into the "weed" industry for the stocks. You also have pharma with a head start. How can Tilray or any other weed stock compete against small state companies on one end and big national companies on the other?  The weed stocks are only in their position now because it's still illegal. Once that's gone they are all the next Sears.|2021-11-18 14:06:59

l4htm2|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|0|What do you guys think of this? I have absolutely no proof to back up this strategy, but my reasoning seems logical to me, so I would like some second opinon because I do not trust myself.  A lot of Canadian companies have a thicker listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. I feel like a good strategy would be to wait for Canadian companies to have an earning report which exceed expectation, before buying the symbol on the TSX first thing in the morning instead of the NYSE, simply because the TSX dosen't allow ah trading, which mean that in theory you wouldn't miss the big jump, if you wait for the result and you wouldn't take the risk of everyone else cashing out as you get in.  (I know that if you live outside USA/Canada, trading on the TSX might not be an option for you.) The only downside is that the TSX usually have a much lower volume, which mean that it would take longer for the stock to move up and to sell it at the price you want.|2021-11-18 08:37:55
