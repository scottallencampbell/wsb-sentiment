Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities - that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future - will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight.

You can only invest in pre-IPO companies if you're an 'accredited investor', which means you basically need to have an income over $200k+ for several years at a minimum, a combined income over $300k+ with a spouse, or a net worth over $1M that excludes the value of your home.  You can't even use a site like equityzen to invest in pre-IPO shares unless you're basically rich as shit.  The SEC wants to make sure the poors and common man cannot have access to pre-IPO investments like rich people do who often cash in and get gigantic returns when companies IPO. What the fuck is the point of these barriers to entry?  Yet the SEC lets some college kid making $9/hr picking his nose while working his on campus job to invest in options strategies like box spreads through Robinhood. WTF.|2021-11-18 05:57:29

l44k8b|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|21|NVDA- heres what you dont get retards. They improved margins to 68%. They said they have solved their chip shortage and it wont be an issue in 6 months (Q2 22). They have spent the last 5 years building the Omniverse and have just succeeded in essentially becoming a full stack company.   That means they make the chips, the servers, and the software for AI. This AI ‚Äúomniverse‚Äù is their dream and theyve realized it. They charge $1,000 per ‚Äúuser‚Äù or ‚Äúavatar‚Äù.   That avatar is an AI simulation. So if you have a self driving car, which they are going to make available for any and every car manufacturer, $1,000 a year. If you have a simulated AI taking orders at your drive thru‚Ä¶ $1,000 a year.   In the future their goal is to have 100% of internet traffic touching a GPU. They have demonstrated their AI Omniverse product can achieve AI processing speeds up to one million times greater than before.   They said in earnings call this gives them up to 100million potential new customers at $1,000 a year. The technology has been built. They‚Äôre using it right now. They‚Äôre simulating cities, factory floors for productions, cars for self driving, human avatars for fluid language interfaces‚Ä¶ etc.   Their earnings call guided revenue up almost 1 billion more than expected. And theyre set for massive growth in the future for AI, while ALSO still growing their gaming GPU and server supply business by up to 50-60% a year.   So dont get those puts bro.|2021-11-18 06:46:36

I'm sure plenty of people got close to calling the top or just generally had a decent exit point, and made good money on it.

The 52-week low is $14.94, the 52-week high is $43.00 (but you may as well ignore the high, go look at the chart).  Anyway, it will probably be $18.xx in a few months. $15.15 to $18.00 is a \~ 19% return.   Average market return over time is 10%, not factoring-in inflation. So I'm good with 19% in three months or so.  $30B market cap. PE ratio of 5.00. Nobody in WSB will buy any. Have a great day.|2021-11-18 11:11:59

He collected $10k in pure margin for adaptive cruise.  Using FSD for anything else is a death wish.  He knew he couldn't afford to make FSD work the only way it can possibly work...with LIDAR.  Every expert knows this, even Musk.  Apple knows it as well.  But they are doing it the right way.    Has Musk talked about taking out the steering wheel?   Why is that?|2021-11-18 12:24:16

l483o1|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|1|Do not buy shares of Sweetgreen (SG) in today's IPO.  Sweetgreen (SG) is expected to go public on November 18, 2021 with a midpoint valuation of $24/share, which would earn the stock an unattractive rating.   I do not think investors should expect to make any money in Sweetgreen stock if the expected valuation comes true. A $24/share valuation implies Sweetgreen‚Äôs revenue will grow 8x 2020 levels and faster than Chipotle in its first 10 years after going public.   **I think the stock is likely worth $0 given the company‚Äôs limited differentiation and the intense competition from other new entrants and established restaurants, which are easily replicating Sweetgreen‚Äôs menu and concept.**   Despite its large online presence, Sweetgreen lost market share in 2020 to stronger, better-positioned competitors. Sweetgreen‚Äôs locally-sourced supply chain adds safety risks and hurts the company‚Äôs ability to achieve the economies of scale that more vertically integrated restaurants enjoy.

l5dbp8|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|1|Moderna (MRNA) vs Novavax (NVAX) Your thoughts?  I‚Äôm thinking of selling some or all of my Novavax and putting it into Moderna instead. Is there a compelling Bull case for Novavax to convince me to stick with it long term?  I‚Äôve been underwater on NVAX much of the year while Moderna has been very good to me. If I sell today I‚Äôll probably break even.   I‚Äôm also very disappointed that Novavax has failed (again) to bring something to market in the US. I was hoping for a joint COVID/Flu annual vaccine from them, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything to suggest that‚Äôs on the near horizon.   MRNA: $251.80 Revenue: $11.83B P/E $14.86 EPS: $16.31 52 Week Low vs High: $88.61 - $497.49  NVAX: $190.70 Revenue: $1.20B P/E: $‚Äî EPS: $-14.81 52 Week Low vs High: $85.62 - $331.68  Position: 30 NVAX and 46 MRNA|2021-11-18 12:08:41

l5vdbm|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|-5|People do realize that if Weed is legalized fully nationwide it will create excess competition, remove cost barriers for growing conditions, and the prices would crater.  Right?  Like, they'd make less profit than the cig companies who are barely going anywhere, not much upside, if any.  The belief that mass money would come in with legalization and send specifically weed stocks flying outside an initial bump is hilarious at best. A good chunk of major state growers aren't even public, now they and the smaller ones would have no restrictions.  How much money could Tilray possibly make in a race to the bottom in prices, $5?  It's a long term disaster for weed stocks.  I get the logic, that more weed means more money from people to buy it, but there are two issues with this, first, not everyone wants weed and it'll never be more popular than cigs.   Secondly, you aren't considering who is getting the money. Some of these are just other category companies that also decide to sell weed, that doesn't really put money into the "weed" industry for the stocks. You also have pharma with a head start. How can Tilray or any other weed stock compete against small state companies on one end and big national companies on the other?  The weed stocks are only in their position now because it's still illegal. Once that's gone they are all the next Sears.|2021-11-18 14:06:59

l4htm2|qwnc4a|qwnc4a|0|What do you guys think of this? I have absolutely no proof to back up this strategy, but my reasoning seems logical to me, so I would like some second opinon because I do not trust myself.  A lot of Canadian companies have a thicker listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. I feel like a good strategy would be to wait for Canadian companies to have an earning report which exceed expectation, before buying the symbol on the TSX first thing in the morning instead of the NYSE, simply because the TSX dosen't allow ah trading, which mean that in theory you wouldn't miss the big jump, if you wait for the result and you wouldn't take the risk of everyone else cashing out as you get in.  (I know that if you live outside USA/Canada, trading on the TSX might not be an option for you.) The only downside is that the TSX usually have a much lower volume, which mean that it would take longer for the stock to move up and to sell it at the price you want.|2021-11-18 08:37:55
