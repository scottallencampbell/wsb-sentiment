6mxlqw|drxo17|drxo17|76|Autistic thought here, but what if this AMD price action is partially influenced by people levering up with the RH recursive loop with algos and trend followers coming in behind?   Alone, RH PRT users abusing the loop won‚Äôt move the price much, but multiple algos would notice the consistent buy orders and buy shares themselves anticipating more share purchases to bring prices up further. Then trend followers and scalp traders notice the upward momentum and buy shares too. This process loops as algos, PRT users, and trend followers continue to push prices higher by continuing to buy shares, outweighing any sells on AMD. Throw in some FOMO and index fund rebalancing we have a potential recipe for a 10% increase one week.  I guess we‚Äôll find out once the PRT loop is fully closed and if it causes AMD to go back down.|2019-11-05 13:11:04

6n9kvs|drxo17|drxo17|7|There's nothing interesting for today's **Magical Crayons TA.** We traded more or less flat. Today's flatness pushed us into one of two rising wedges I had mentioned yesterday. If you're a bull you want to see us tomorrow test and break 308. If we trade above 309 by Friday we'll have escaped that pattern.   If you're a bear I will again reiterate the bulls are super insulated. There's a support at 306.2 and another at 305, so drastic drops without news are unlikely.   As mentioned yesterday, the upcoming economic announcements for the week haven't impacted the market in a bearish manner even when expectations missed, so right now an upcoming correction would have to be technical by algos/chartists or by some piece of unexpected news event.|2019-11-05 14:51:58

6lynwr|drxo17|drxo17|6|So this is the real way to make money on this infinite leverage trick.   1. Find a big company with a small market cap ala JCP   2. Get around 100 retards to perform the infinite leverage trick to around $2M.   3. WSB members now have majority control in said company   4. Motion the board to officially declare bankruptcy or permanent closures or mass layoffs, something to make the company tank.   5. Shares are worthless, Calls that were written are now worthless.

6mo0s3|drxo17|drxo17|5|PINS ER got leaked early to MM's, which then dropped the stock price by ~10% in the few days leading up to the ER to make their losses less damaging upon the public release.    Then MCD extends its bleed from its decent ER because, again, MM's knew Eastbrook would be let go because they knew of the investigation which no one else did publicly. Stock barely reacts to it and immediately rises over the next 2 days...as if it were priced in....a thing no one should have known about.  These two moves saved people countless millions which they profited from. This is only *one week* of watching two tickers egregiously manipulated by insiders with insider information.  I know this berserk shit goes on daily over thousands of tickers. And yet CTN, a literal retard who drooled his way into a stupid ass position and lost a few thousand, is the only one with threats of a possible SEC investigation?   The rich operate in a totally different fuckin universe and I thoroughly wish I could warp there.|2019-11-05 11:45:04

Got asked if I needed help by the same "girl" like 4 times and followed around basically then made me check out in a separate check out place and was asked why I was buying the detergents and the printer. For the printer I was asked  Why are you getting one? I said for work  What happened to your old one? I said just needed another   Where do you work (was asked 3 times and I never answered)   Tried to be sold 2 different coverage plans for the printer  Tried to be sold ink 2 or 3timesx for the printer   Tried to be sold paper 1 or 2 times.  I was so uncomfortable the whole time|2019-11-05 14:37:12
