Then institutions begin to average out their money they move around.  Then it stops.  Because there’s no one left to sell.  Boomers don’t give a fuck and know stonks only go back up  The first crash freaked people out with how sudden it was. So some boomers pulled out, they then saw how fast it rebounded and won’t make that same mistake again.   Don’t be a dumb retard and go “why aren’t stocks going to 0” as selling slows. Also, recognize that once selling has come to a halt it’s only up from there.|2020-05-14 09:48:21

Profitable every year since 2007 (ebitda margins 8% in 2008-2009) and had 14 straight quarters of flat/positive same-store sale growth. Trades at 5x eps, <2x earnings ex cash, 1.0x ebitda. FCF has exceeded ebitda significantly the past 6 years (156% CFFO less capex). Co-founders own 26% of shares outstanding. They could burn cash for 4-5 years without facing bankruptcy.

qmzz1r|gjjjxj|gjjjxj|3|Valuable lessons learned today about stop losses. My original position was $284c for 0.7, with a stop loss at SPY $276.87. Stop loss was about 50 cents off the low, but the trade was definitely the right move.     After the drop I expected a small bounce and then continuation so went into puts at the 50% retracement level, should have set a stop loss at the high of the day because that would invalidate my thesis, but I didn't and ended up losing $1.5k.      Lesson one: set intelligent stop losses.     Lesson two: Getting stopped out doesn't mean your thesis is always wrong. There's no harm in re-entering a good trade that you got stopped out on if your thesis is still playing out. I could have re-entered the morning trade and set the exact same stop loss and would have been fine.|2020-05-14 14:59:13

But It didn’t get negative interest rates so now the 1% will throw a hissy fit until it gets them despite how much they might fuck the economy long term. That’s all this is. Market is gonna cry until it gets what it wants and when it does it will go back and powell will think he did his job. It’s just to break powell he gave too much too fast. That’s because he’s Donald trumps bitch and he has no balls. Other fed chairman’s let the crash happen before getting involved for this reason! Give the market too much too quickly and then it just wants more and more. It needed to get closer to a fair value before it got infinite QE, junk bonds bought, junk debt ETFs being bought. It got everything it wanted and it’s still gonna tank because it wants negative rates. It sounds like I’m talking about the market like an actual child and it’s because it is. It’s the minds of every ceo and institution trading this. They know they’re gonna break powell middle class be dammed and he will go negative.|2020-05-14 09:18:01

On Tuesday mid-morning, when we were still hovering around 292 but were dropping fast to 290, and I saw the VIX still at 26, I went to buy VIX 30c for 05/19. They were 1.40 each. But I doubted my vibe and didn't buy them. Just looked at the same call strike right now, each one is worth 8.70, almost a 700% gain on something that was, at least to me, a fairly obvious as a play. I also hadn't slept in 24 hours, so I think that effected my judgment.

If your local bodega gets shut down, the place that sells them the empanadas they sell just finds another corner and is just fine.  States still need to ramp up testing and per FDA new regulation, CODX can now distribute nation-wide, so really I don't see how this makes any difference, unless you have a calls at 30 =/|2020-05-14 13:15:29

qn10p8|gjjjxj|gjjjxj|2|Well. Would’ve been a helluva day today if I didn’t start by selling all of my PENN at open while it was down 3 percent. One of those trades that makes me feel so stupid I pulled some of the capital out of my account.   Had a market order in for Aurora that never hit the limit this morning, missed that one.   Then I didn’t buy any VBIV options this morning bc they were only .01 and the volume was so low. So I got shares. Ended up getting in with options when they were already up 10%.   Ended positive for the day but feels like I should’ve fucking crushed.   So I just threw 1k at draftkings earnings  before close bc fuck it|2020-05-14 15:07:38

If we get a C wave of the mid term fractal, it will confirm also that we are now on the C wave of the long term fractal that started with the flash crash.  Short, mid, and long term fractals are all lining up. Extreme, super duper, helmet on head autism says we're going to get a rogue wave and bulls will never walk the same again.

I was starting to believe the stocks only go up guys but I really think we're in a new trend.  It's odd that futures didn't prop up the price last night like they've been doing for a while. It either means, the market is just able to move down freely now or whatever makes that decision doen't need to prop it up anymore and it'll just go up naturally. I doubt the latter is the case.   Also, premarket prices are now below the .5 fib line. I think that's a real indicator that we may see $265 before long.  Buying 5/29 $272p when we open.|2020-05-14 08:23:41

I'll be honest, I have a couple questions myself: 1) Why was the contract price so low to begin with at only $0.40/per? Is this a volume thing? 2) If not a volume thing, why is the price of the contract decreasing? Doesn't make sense even with IV crush if it's already below the strike price.
