vul2g8|heyhlj|heyhlj|55|There's really no reason not to risk a lot. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car needing a credit score.  Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.  We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck r/investing and those 2% savings accounts. &nbsp; 2% is a fucking milk jug number, not real gainz.  &nbsp; Go for the millions. If you don't make it, it doesn't matter anyways because most of us will die working. But at least you would have tried, which is more than most.   &nbsp; Good luck today, WSB!|2020-06-24 08:27:54

You didn't get the memo last week I guess:  >IMF set to slash economic forecasts and warns of a crisis ‘unlike anything the world has seen’. The real economy is hit hard. We will release a new forecast on the 24 th of June and expect it to reflect the extremely challenging conditions. In April, we projected minus 3 percent for global growth in 2020. We are likely to revise downward further on the basis of incoming data, which tells us that most countries are doing worse than we had projected.

I think at this point I am not holding any gains on calls for more than a day unless there are underlying reasons for a particular stock to be bullish. We are definitely trending down overall. I watched some clips from news around the world last night, and throughout the world everyone is bracing for massive overall declines to GDP. Tourism and travel has halted, and may not resume any time soon. Here in Las Vegas we are going to hunker down for a solid 2-3 year recession no doubt.  Converted bear to bull in April, now I'm re-converting... We are in a bear market guys. Calls will work when the fed continues to prop up the market, and some stocks may charge through the recession or go up with it, but overall market forces are pulling us back down slowly but surely.

vv8qn5|heyhlj|heyhlj|7|The U.S. is weighing new tariffs on $3.1 billion of exports from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K., risking igniting a wider transatlantic trade fight later this summer. The U.S. Trade Representative wants to impose new tariffs on olives, beer, gin and trucks, while increasing duties on aircraft, cheese and yogurt. Read up on the U.S. trade approach and why it wants to renegotiate WTO commitments.  It was risk off in global markets after the tariff news and as virus fears rattled investor sentiment. U.S. stock futures fell with shares in Europe and Asia. Treasuries, the dollar and gold rose. Oil declined. Austria got record orders for its century bond sale.  Virus: Infected passengers arrived in Hong Kong from Dubai, Manila and Kuala Lumpur in recent days, underscoring risks that come with reopening borders. EU officials are considering banning Americans from entry. Donald Trump hasn't met with health officials about the rapid uptick in U.S. cases.

vuc3mz|heyhlj|heyhlj|66|You decide to go play some roulette at the casino. You call up a taxi.  “You’re in luck!” the taxi driver says. “I just came from there. There’s a table rigged to always come up black! You’re gonna be rich!” You smile and nod.   As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. “You’re in luck buddy! There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.   You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.   As you lay your cash down and load up on puts you give Big Jay a wink. "Red".   You see the confused expression on Big Jay’s face as he spins the wheel. “Black” he calls with a sigh.   “This game is fucking rigged!” you shout as your puts expire worthless.|2020-06-24 06:42:22

vvpplw|heyhlj|heyhlj|5|If your holding PFE like me see below I think its gonna be ok. First they had a merger in some sub companies that got delayed due to covid which in conjunction with their bad results on some breast cancer drug have tumbled there stock price, also losing the exclusivity to some other drugs some shit with an L and viagra. But come friday june 30th it's supposed to clear potentially giving PFE some life(the merger making the largest generic brand pharma company). Likely along in a week or two releasing their results on their covid 19 trials this could be the next mrna potentially rocketing this stock. I want to note all of this is subject to change and can potentially not happen i.e. merger gets pushed again, no vaccine results. Please do not use this as financial advice as u can see how much I've lost do your own research. Personally I believe this stock is ready for an explosive growth but I'm biased as fuck.

[Venture capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital) was easy to raise. [Investment banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_bank), which profited significantly from [initial public offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#cite_note-swindle-11) A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the [quaternary sector of the economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_sector_of_the_economy) and confidence that the companies would turn future profits **created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the** [**price–earnings ratio**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93earnings_ratio)**,** and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a [stock market bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#cite_note-enigma-9) Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%."  **"An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred** during the boom and stories of people quitting their jobs to engage in full-time [day trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading) were common.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#cite_note-13) The [news media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media) took advantage of the public's desire to invest in the stock market; an article in [*The Wall Street Journal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal) suggested that investors "re-think" the "quaint idea" of profits, and [CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC) reported on the stock market with the same level of suspense as many networks provided to the [broadcasting of sports events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_of_sports_events)."  ========================================================================  We're playing musical chairs right now.

vv0r1m|heyhlj|heyhlj|3|"New York, New Jersey and Connecticut impose 14-day quarantine on travelers from coronavirus hotspot states" - CNBC  How do the states enforce this, anyone has any experience with this stuff? I could literally drive from Florida to New York and no official will ever know. Maybe if people flew in from those states, but you could just fly to Pennsylvania, rent a car, and then drive to New York and avoid the "quarantine". As such long Hertz! Clearly a buy signal.  Edit: The quarantine will be self-imposed, so take it upon yourself to stay inside if you go to New York... Obviously that worked so well before because we're so considerate of others that we'll travel across the country just to stay indoors for 14 days to protect others. 90% of the people traveling are gonna just ignore the "quarantine" and go about their business then return to their state.|2020-06-24 10:47:43

Imagine if he let the markets reach a natural, sensible low where people could buy the dip, make even more gains, and avoid the inflation problem entirely.

Of course, if the market starts to perform as badly as before, it's likely the Fed will step in again, so I doubt it goes nearly as low as previously.|2020-06-24 11:17:41

vudb2w|heyhlj|heyhlj|8|I stand corrected.  The amount of new COVID cases (regardless of a lower hospitalization rate) might derail us. The Gov has to vote for more stimulus and provide the 1T that everyone is expecting.   Unemployment benefits must be extended until the end of the year.     Too much has been done to save the market, they need to keep it up.  For gods sake everyone wear a mask!!!!!|2020-06-24 06:58:40

vuhsce|heyhlj|heyhlj|9|I stand corrected ...  I relooked at the data for the virus. If you consider the rise in cases as a lagging indicator to deaths and larger possibility to spread along with more protests and people traveling then it is clear we are going to hit a point soon that people might decide to shelter-in-place.     I had rose colored glasses on.  If the market does not shrug off higher infection rates then we are going to have a big problem with the march to new S&P highs.   I am much less certain we run to 340 without going much lower and getting better data on the virus.  I need to figure out how I position for some more downside.  I retract my comment on wearing masks.|2020-06-24 07:53:13

Bears on the other day are much more sane and have reasoning behind not trusting the rally we had till yesterday.

Feels like market is positioning itself just in case we get another "stay at home" movement even if there are no more government lockdowns.  Only reason rest of the market hasn't really fallen apart is that the number of deaths has remained low despite cases spiking in the US.  But it's not clear at all whether that's just because we can keep critical patients alive for longer or whether survival rate is increasing to the point that the coronavirus death rate looks more like a seasonal flu than a once in a generation pandemic.|2020-06-24 07:44:21

I don't think retail has been scared off from buying the dip or has been scared into selling. If anything, they're probably going to refinance their mortgage or raise money from their friends and family promising 50% returns every month and buy the dip with that cash.

Don't doubt they'll crash servers and shit too.   But... They're only human, and they can't physically stop the market from crashing. So like, it's probably gonna crash. Seriously. Bet on red, and even then maybe don't even play because you may not even be able to get your money.  EDIT: Remember, always inverse WSB. Buncha comments calling me a retard? You do the math.

It’s surprising when companies that can clearly weather the storm take a dive, but it’s also an easy buying opportunity. We’re seeing tons of infection, but still no crazy death numbers.

vvmgqn|heyhlj|heyhlj|2|This pull back is healthy....but I can't help but feel it's manufactured.   Tinfoil Theory 1: Between the flat 2/3 weeks and this pull back, I feel the boomers think that it will achieve crushing new comers to the market or blow up the accounts of small RH traders.   Tinfoil Theory 2: Profit taking and reduction to create a secondary buying frenzy based on the bank reporting.  If the rich plethora of bad news across the board didn't achieve a circuit breaker event today, I am not sure what else the market needs to elicit end of feb type drop.

vvu9e9|heyhlj|heyhlj|1|So for the average investor they look possibly 1-5, 1-10 years down the rode.   So when they invest in faang I guess they see long term potential. So then it’s unlikely that we can dip under 295. Since the dip gets bought out on these big companies.  But if news were to come after hours and they had to reflect in the am. Then we could see a huge drop with no industry to prop up the spy500. But what news could do that, each state can declare lockdown at their own proghtive.

The 55c are up about 80%. the 60c I was bagholding recovered is back in the green and is up 70% in the last few days and keeps moving. Goldman upped the price target to 61 today and there was report yesterday about unusual options activity on the 60c for 7/17 and August.  Should I roll my 55c out to August to 60c, take about 1100 in profit in doing so by keeping the same amount of contracts, and call it a day? Or should I give it another day or two (maybe till Monday) so I do it on a more flat or green day?|2020-06-24 12:27:28
