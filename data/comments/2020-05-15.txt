Statistically, based on stats run in the sub data, only 30% of the moves and comments have been correct or profitable in this sub. 70% have lost or were wrong.  Basically, it's not even a meme. INVERSE WSB.  Therefore, green Monday confirmed. Stimulus and NYSE floor reopening being priced in. New rally incoming. I'm telling you guys this right now before it happens.   Please don't make the wrong moves. I'm 100% sure we're going to tank in these coming months (as a bear), but now is not the time. Don't make an emotional monday circuit-breaker play, because Monday isn't it. Be a short-term bull, and a long-term bear. You don't have to be perma one gang or the other.

qpuvro|gk6goa|gk6goa|7|With 25k new cases a day, the united states is still peaking. Other countries have taken more drastic measures, such as Italy, which has reduced its new cases load to 10% of its peak, or 1000 a day.  Unfortunately, Italy's testing capacity has only gone up. They are not finding many new cases, dispelling any notion that covid 19 is widespread or 10x people actually have. Simply not the case.   With that in mind, its time to start looking at the real facts out of italy. 223k cases. 33k dead. 15% death rate. These are the numbers, deal with them.  America has not taken any new drastic meaures of the last 2 weeks to reduce its rate of 25k new cases a day. In fact, containment measures are loosening with states reopening.  This is possibly one of the worst strategic blunders in the history of the world. Spy 100 eoy|2020-05-15 09:53:29

qpdqxt|gk6goa|gk6goa|3|Pfizer calls were really cheap this week. I'm generally a bear on all the vaccine companies because all but one will fail, but Pfizer is attractively priced overall and has a very aggressive trial schedule and a lot of resources. The most important clue to me is that they are diverting hundreds of millions of dollars of their profitable products to third party manufacturers so they can fully produce their vaccine. That tells me they really believe in it because you don't dump your profit streams in a global recession without a really good reason.  Long PFE $40c 9/18|2020-05-15 06:53:51

It may take a day or two to get where it needs to be, but I've made about 6 10%+ gains trades doing this over the last 10 days or so. When there's no other moves that I'm comfortable with, I'll defer to SNAP and it has treated me well.  &#x200B;  Right now its around $17.05-$17.15 all day, so not touching it...but when you do notice it around either of those numbers, double check the general trend and make your bet for some (usually) easy tendies|2020-05-15 11:51:55

According to people familiar with the matter, the DoJ may come up with a lawsuit by the summer while a Texas case is expected to be filed in the fall.

qq72gp|gk6goa|gk6goa|5|So here's a story of me tripping balls on Salvia back in 07.  Prior to starting our illustrious college careers to becoming functioning members of society, it was Senior Beach Week at Cherry Grove.   I was sitting on a bed, there was another one parallel to the bed I was on, 3 people on each bed waiting to hit the bowl for a total of 6 people in the room.   The bowl arrives to me so I hit it and as soon as I do I start rocking back and forth uncontrollably.   I legit thought I was a box of cereal, rocking, and falling over in the shopping cart; I couldn't sit still or sit up only teeter.  Visually everyone still looked like people but my brain was registering them as other groceries in the cart.   As people left the room, my brain was telling me they were being rung up.   The End.

I just learned that even part time minimal wage people can now claim about $4,000/month in unemployment benefits, about 4x more than what they used to earn before coronavirus.  Friend of mine, who has beauty salon that never turned any profit got $11k from government, just like that. Her boyfriend works in a restaurant, and the owner got about $75,000 just like that.

qq3kxq|gk6goa|gk6goa|2|I don't know why I never learn. When your puts that were down 50% flash green just exit at breakeven. What do you expect is going to happen that it will keep going? You know that only happens when you sell at breakeven after having been down 50%. When you hold on it flashes green and then never goes green again.      In summary:     When I buy something it will immediately lose all of it's value.   When I sell it at a loss it will turn around and go +300% from the point I sold.   When I hold on it will turn around and flash green, but if I sell at breakeven it will keep going to +300%.   When I hold on after it flashes green it will go back down to 0%.

That move was designed to cut Huawei off from some U.S. semiconductor makers.  Over the last year, however, Huawei’s suppliers have largely [managed to get around the blacklisting ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-manages-to-make-smartphones-without-american-chips-11575196201?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline)through a technicality. American companies—such as [Qualcomm](https://quotes.wsj.com/QCOM) Inc. and [Intel](https://quotes.wsj.com/INTC) Corp. —could still supply Huawei with some chips that are manufactured overseas. Huawei has also greatly ramped up the use of HiSilicon-designed chips, primarily built by TSMC, thereby reducing its reliance on the U.S. supply chain.  Huawei is now capable of building both 5G base-stations and advanced smartphones free of American technology, The Wall Street Journal reported in December.|2020-05-15 11:28:37

qqkzg5|gk6goa|gk6goa|3|On paper, the actions of the Federal Reserve are supposed to be limited to controlling the pace of inflation while also promoting low unemployment. In practice, they often seem to do what is best for the markets. Just look at the difference between their actions in December 2018 versus the first few months of 2019. As soon as they saw that rate hikes and quantitative tightening were hurting the markets, they did a complete reversal and started cutting rates again.     Just how connected are members of the Fed with investment companies? Are they regularly having private meetings with big bank CEOs, as Trump does? I started thinking about this when they tapped Blackrock to do bond ETF purchases for them, since they legally can't. At least one former member of the Fed went on to work for Blackrock. Blackrock controls a *lot* of money in the markets. It wouldn't surprise me if the Fed was actively coordinating with Blackrock (and the other gigantic investment companies) to help them achieve profits and avoid losses (at the expense of retail traders like ourselves). Which is so fucking corrupt I can't even delve into it further. But would love to hear about any other shady shit the Fed is doing.|2020-05-15 13:29:11

Effective immediately, we will also be authorizing members of the reserve force to employ a variety of nonlethal and lethal methods to compel Floridians to frequent hair salons, roller rinks, and trampoline parks.”  **^(This is a satire news)**|2020-05-15 12:37:03

qpf38p|gk6goa|gk6goa|-4|For all of those who are covering calls right now   Knock, knock  You press you ear against the wood of the door. “Who’s there?” - your voice breaks, all you can think of is of the last time you took a stand but those times are long gone....  Suddenly you feel a strong thud of air against your chest pushing you back. Your mouselike vision is filled from splinters flying at you from the now wide open door.  The cold piercing air fills your head. The dust settles through the strong beams of sunlight. Your eyes barley open as you try to focus in on the doorway.   It’s market open again - you think to yourself.  The bright light is blinding, you ponder why you choose to stay in your mothers house trading stocks when you need to find a new job.  A person is at the doorway standing over you tall and confident. “Pick a side” he bellows.  It’s the Theta gang - you think to yourself  You proceed to cautiously turn around, your pants crumple at your ankles as you see the empty and destitute room behind you.  “Make it slow and drawn out, this is my last hundred” you whisper glancing back.  The Theta leaders mouth twitches into a devilish smile   “as you wish”....|2020-05-15 07:12:09

Quick question: is there any way to get Robinhood to wait to sell your options until the very end of the trading day if you don't have enough cash balance to cover?  Just lost $40 b/c they sold my Baba 5/15 $200c at 3pm. Now I would have been at +$120ish. Do people wait until after 3pm on OpEx days to invest so all the Robinhood noobs like me get screwed?  And I know the true lesson was to sell when I was at 300% last week... but still curious about this.|2020-05-15 14:53:23
