8zocii|e2wlh4|e2wlh4|12|With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits.

I can imagine all sorts of cool outfits that show off my ball cleveage, for the office, for the pool, weddings and any sort of occasion.  Wearing ball cleavage shorts will allow us men to use our assets to flirt with women who are in power in hopes of gaining some unfair advantage over those who are less endowed.  There would be "wonder shorts" which push the balls up front and accentuate the cleavage. Like diamonds on a pedestal.  There would be a little hole in the shorts to let the ball cleavage poke through|2019-11-28 13:07:14

904sxn|e2wlh4|e2wlh4|3|what yall "nothingburger" -sayers should know:  1. china is NOT desperate for a trade deal 2. rhetoric leads to action (just cos they're not doing anything right now does not mean they won't later) 3. futures may have recovered but it's the f'in holidays - there is absolutely no volume out there right now. wait til 8pm est to see. 4. it's ok to be long right now but trade cautiously. if there is a rug pull it will be steep and it will hurt. markets are extended and we're diverging. we need a pullback/consolidation to keep this train running into 2020 at a healthy pace 5. it's ok to be short right now for all the reasons noted in #4 but again size your positions a bit smaller cos this thing can keep pumping til VIX is at $9|2019-11-28 13:08:49
