Ive never in my life heard a CEO start saying anything close... they will smash apple and saudi aramco marketcap combined ... with a car company. and don't tell me about AI future .. google and 20 others have that covered,FFS .. this year BYD overtook tesla in EV car sales ...THEY DROPPED TO NO.2!!!!...It should be BYD coming out with this nonsense lol..just wait for 2023, ..enter cathy musk, your new WSB meme for the next 20 years when describing teslas trillion dollar evaluation.  Tesla is the nokia of EV's .. first to take the market, albeit with huge risk and marketing espenses... but the big boys were just waiting to see it how was done and when it would eventually be more profitable than pushing 50'000 diesel/petrol cars a day out of a mold for the price of a toaster... they will ease themsleves in to the market and then gobble gobble gobble when they feel like... Elon knows this, that's why he's hyping new unprofitable projects like a lunatic .. those will also be consumed in the same way. ... the man spends at least half of his day thinking of witty tweets and how they will go down... he's done his part, he's really not the 'mega geniu' creator from ex-machina .. hes the son of a rich blood diamond dealer..go figure,  no single car company will ever dominate the market the same way apple could somewhat do it with phones. people look at cars like art, they see different things in it, that's why after 100 years, the range of desires are huge ...people go for unique if the have money, and style preference, cultrure preference etc .... apple dont have this, there's no bugatti phones, theres nobody buying classic blackberrys .. the phone is just a neccesary instrument, the apps inside create a whole new market... people just want the best on paper, it's a means to an end with the range of apps inside, that's a whole other market.... If apple sales market cap starts falling to far and people see it as a stagnant company, they will only then start branching into other areas, same way amazon needed to .. for now apple just do what they do because it works and is winnning ..keep the rest of the cards close, and insane amounts of cash on hand ... if tesla starts eating apples market cap too much, they'll have apple cars ... tesla is just hype, great hype .. but his statements yesterday were immature and pandering.  that's a lot of reading, enjoy my idiotic hot take  &#x200B;  and to edit, im not an apple head .. just using Elons projecting on trampling on it's market value.|2022-10-20 16:11:14t23ha9|y8u05w|y8u05w|9|You're hitting your girl from the back and about to finish when she turns her head and says "btw, I'm the one who sold you those Tesla calls" wyd 🤔|2022-10-20 06:46:36t240zm|y8u05w|y8u05w|9|Its not manipulation  Its called you suck at this|2022-10-20 06:51:53t2k6i7|y8u05w|y8u05w|10|This shit is being propped up so hard for midterms.

China is the biggest issue.    Elon states clearly it is worse than US.  And Elon claims US is fine and they will sell the same cars but it just does not align with reality.  Why isn't Austin pumping out more cars?  Why has Tesla not even posted Cybertruck prices?  Rivian and Ford have had this more a long long time.   The Cybertruck is going to be a niche product that doesn't generate the margin that the Model Y produces.  And my view is that the demand for $65k Model Y is going to peak in US if it hasn't already.

Why would they sell into an unfavorable market? We saw that to an extent during the pandemic where in theory there should have been a big crash around urban areas but it was heavily subdued by tightened supply.  The only time we’ve ever seen a massive drop in housing prices akin to what we’ve regularly seen in the stock market was in 08 where people were literally forced to sell their houses by variable mortgage rates suddenly spiking to levels they couldn’t afford.  Gold has performed like trash during this crash. As has crypto and stocks. The only asset that held up was real estate and that’s how it’s gonna be for the next several decades until population decline combined with urbanization starts to make rural areas completely worthless. As usual, Japan is decades ahead of us in this regard. You can buy homes in nice, low crime Japenese towns for 30k because there’s not enough people left to live in them. And they’re still overpriced because demand will never eclipse supply again.  Tl dr; housing in shitty areas of the US will remain shitty.
