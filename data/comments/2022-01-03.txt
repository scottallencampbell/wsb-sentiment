I like the chart from a technical perspective. Great base set up right now.  FSS - Federal Signal Corporation: makes radios, sirens, speciality electronics for huge gvt police, fire military etc contracts. Great chart  MSGS - Madison Square Garden: great dip this month due to fears of closing nba and nhl seasons due to Covid. Msgs owns the knicks and the rangers and the garden itself. Rangers just set a record nhl valuation at $2 billion. That’s huge for an nhl team. Should move msgs significantly higher.  MBT - Mobile Telesystems: literally just riding the ups and waiting for super predictable dips on this one for the last 7 months. easy money honestly  NYT - New York Times: self explanatory. Great bullish set up right now.  STE - Steris: medical equipment company specializing in sterilization products for hospitals which has been awesome throughout Covid.

Soon after FDA will inspect plants and approve AXS 05 and stock will move much higher, probably well above $100.  It's been over four months since FDA reviewed and did not reject AXS 05, later citing issues with manufacturing as the basis for their August 09 letter to the co. These matters do not take forever to fix and it's right about time to expect some really good news from the co.  $150 stock trading at $37.00. Do your own DD. See for yourself.
