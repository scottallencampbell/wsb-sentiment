dp83j8|k1dfo8|k1dfo8|55|10 years ago I was strung out on heroin. 5 years ago I was working shitty jobs and still strung out on oxy, doing up to 300mg a day when I could afford it. \~3 years ago I got fired from a job and disrespected in a bad way by a boss, and I wanted to get back at him. I rode spite like rocket, started my own business competing with him. I would tell myself I wouldn't stop until I stole every customer from him. Until he starved. Last year he sold his company and now I get nothing but complaining customers of his that become my returning customers. My business comes up on Google at #1 for what I optimized it for. I haven't touched an opiate in 2 years. I will make a clean six figures in 2021 for the first time in my life. I am about to hire employees for the first time because I'm overwhelmed. I don't owe nobody shit and have nobody to answer to but myself for the first time in my life.      If you are in a shitty situation, just know you can turn it around and ride that anger, that spite, those doubts, all the way up. You can transmute that shit like an alchemist and eat it as fuel. I came from nothing, a poor single mother, no college, and now I'll never have to go back to that and when I have kids they'll never have to be in that place. Fucking changed the destiny of my lineage with my big swinging dick in my hand. Anybody can do it. You can't have the light without the dark.  Profoundly grateful this Thanksgiving, especially for you turkeys. When I go public one day I'll make sure ya'll know the SPAC.|2020-11-26 14:40:03

dodzsh|k1dfo8|k1dfo8|9|I‚Äôm a retard but Friday I‚Äôm buying TSLA 12/11 650c - they‚Äôre 13.30bid 14ask now. WHY? Duhhh....  Come Dec 1 the S&P500 Index funds can own TSLA Shares. They can‚Äôt own in November (as a full autist I spent this morning reading the largest fund prospectuses, rules, and additional info).   There‚Äôs $6Trillion in weighted index funds.   TSLA will represent a 1.5% weighting of the S&P500 index when added (at $560-575/share). That means they have to buy $90Billion in TSLA shares on the open market starting Dec 1. That‚Äôs 16.5% of all TSLA shares. (156Mill shares out of 947.9Mill total shares)  The 12/4 calls expire before the funds have to finish the buying spree the 12/24 are too far out and time is money.   12/11 gives us retards 10 trading days in December to ride the Mr.  fund buyer like our bottom bitch.  Supply/demand is about to skyrocket again on TSLA. Take 16.5% of a float off the table and it drives up the price. 15% move up from 574 is 660.  I‚Äôm going in Friday. You guys want to do another remind me in 2 weeks? Here:  ON DECEMBER 10 TESLA WILL BE 750.   Since I‚Äôm a retard, tell me how I‚Äôm wrong. Here are some retard research links   https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKBN28530W  https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/25/heres-whats-pushing-tesla-stock-toward-600-and-bey/  By the way, in September 8, Investopia said ‚ÄúETSY being added to the S&P 500 isn‚Äôt worth it. There‚Äôs little upside here in the short term‚Äù (it‚Äôs up 32% in 11 weeks).  Fuck the smart research investment reporters and guys like Cramer. You guys are the best advice ever.

dnyypy|k1dfo8|k1dfo8|4|Guys, so yesterday I put an order to buy to close for 3 covered calls I wanted to close. The order was not filling so I canceled it, it said cancel sent. Then about 5-10 minutes later I put in another order buy to close the 3 contracts. Same thing after a while I cancel after not getting filled. Then about 15 minutes later I get a email. My 2 orders got filled (they got manually rejected and then filled by the broker) so he sold to close 6 contracts when I only had 3...  I look to my account and I'm now at +3 contracts (Keep in mind the order bought to close...)  It's a contract expiring 27th nov. So in panic I quickly sell to close the position (3 contracts). I have to wait for approval from the broker and then the order went through. But now it's like I have 2 different positions. One +3 and one -3...  I called the broker and they are still figuring it out... what will happen?? I'm a bit stressed out...  &#x200B;  Edit : So the issue is it bought to close and sold to close... what happens next ?|2020-11-26 08:35:23

Yes, PLTR was a great trade and you doubled your net worth but unless you're cashing out and uninstalling Robinhood, those gains are just paper. Overleveraging with margin and student loans can easily murder you financially if the stock which is up over 60% corrects back down a bit.

You can make money on the way up and the way down. If EVs crash we'll move on to the next bubble sector. If equities as a whole crash, we'll move on to currencies or shitcoyn, or metals, or ammunition and canned goods or whatever. Sure, when it pops a lot of us are going to lose a lot of money but. . . a lot of us here are are losing money every day anyway and we just keep at it.      A bubble pop or prolonged general market crash is only doomsday for buy and hold normies. We will be fine. And the memes will be exquisite.|2020-11-26 13:08:22

dp6vkl|k1dfo8|k1dfo8|14|Bears look for rationality in a fundamentally non rational market and are losing money because of it. Nothing makes sense here and even bulls know it‚Äôs dumb.  But bulls are out buying calls instead of puts, just trying to make money and not worrying about the future they have no control over anyways.   I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs analogous to people‚Äôs search for meaning and a higher power or understanding of the universe and their place in it.   There are numerous religions that sound logical to the people who believe in them, and provide the comforting illusion of structure in the universe. Most, if not all of those explanations are wrong, but comforting to those who believe in them.  I don‚Äôt subscribe to any explanations and long since stopped looking for rationality or purpose. I‚Äôm just here till I die, and trying to get by till then.   I‚Äôd suggest looking at the market that way, and less as a rational place. I think bears might be happier and make more money if they understood that we don‚Äôt control this market, we‚Äôre just tryna get that nut.

dow06v|k1dfo8|k1dfo8|17|LISTEN UP PLTR HOLDERS.   look guys. That stock mooned too much.   It will have higher highs. But no matter how good the company is. There WILL be profit taking and pull backs. Like Shit coin today   So my suggestion.    Take some of your gains and play this low risk play.    TH√áB is banned on this sub. That should tell you that people here are too retarted for it that means it must print.    TH√áB mooned alot after hours. But it should pull back. Buy it. Cuz if merger fails you will get back 10$ plus 22 cents intrest so if you get it at 11.50 it's tolarable risk.   If merge is announced it will moon in next 2 weeks. By then the big dip in PLTR would happen and then you take the tendies from TH√áB and cost average PLTR.    No. Don't leave PLTR cuz idk the futur. Just slim it from the gains.    Remind me in 2 weeks.|2020-11-26 13:09:49

Due to extreme market conditions, tomorrow, the 27th of November, at 15:30 GMT, we will temporarily raise the margin requirements for all CFDs on stocks to 50%.   That means the existing leverage will decrease to 1:2. If you have open positions with stocks, this will affect your account margin level and may lead to the automatic closure of one or multiple positions in case you don‚Äôt have enough free funds.

dovsur|k1dfo8|k1dfo8|4|**Some strategies that have worked for me recently.**  So I just wanted to share with y'all a strategy that's worked for me recently, which is the infamous credit spread. If you don't know what it is I recommend you do your research/DD before attempting. What I've done recently which has been proven to be very profitable has been finding underlying's that are considered blue chips (strong companies with history of just going up over time) that have been beaten down due to either bad earnings or news and dip below 40 on the RSI on the 1 hour chart, finding out where the support and resistances are so for example, MSFT has been trading between 200-230 for almost forever, some news comes out and tech goes down a bit say MSFT starts trading at 208 I would open of a put credit spread around 200/203 and set my exp for roughly two weeks out and double check my POP (probability of profit) in an options strategy analyzer (Etrade has a pretty good one) make sure the trade I'm entering has atleast a 70% chance of expiring at 100% profit and my real secret is always closing my spreads at 50% profit. the chances of it reaching that point of profit are significantly higher and if it doesn't happen fast enough you can always rely on theta decay helping you.  Now here's some tips incase the underlying really moves against you. If you ever feel like you're overleveraged In one sector say tech for example try to pick up some inverse etf calls that are a few weeks out and think of it as picking up insurance. so if a black swan event happens and all of tech drops 5% you won‚Äôt lose your entire collateral and actually still could come out of the entire trade profitable.  Another tip is if the underlying takes an absolute dump, busts through your strikes and exp is only getting closer, then consider rolling your spread out even further, move up your strikes to the point where you're breakeven.  thank you for coming to Denny's|2020-11-26 13:08:20
