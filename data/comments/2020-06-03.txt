sqzwia|gvr9zj|gvr9zj|20|Here's a tip for everyone to stay sane  after exiting a position.  When you exit, delete the underlying from your watchlist and change your graph to a different ticker. Don't look at the ticker again for a while.  Assuming you exited a call option, this way you don't mentally fuck yourself for your smaller profit if the stock shoots up after you sell. You might feel good if it goes down but the mental anguish of missing out on huge gains I'd say is actually more painful than getting enjoyment from learning that you prevented losses.|2020-06-03 09:24:59

Investors were in a panic mid day as violent market swings caused a black monday type crash where the DJIA moved as low as -5 points on the day. Swift government action promising to bailout companies key to the economy such as Starbucks and DraftKings led the DJIA to recover and finish a respectable +5,000 points at close. Key officers at Amazon, Apple, and Tesla say this kind of optimism gives a positive outlook for their companies. All 3 companies hope to catch up to market leader Zoom Communications whose enterprise value tops all 3 of them combined.

As far as I know the other Casino that opened before them make some nice money but of course not the same like before but better than expected.  Either way I don't think people will stay home all the time, so soon or later people need to go out and do things like before and it doesn't matter if there is a Virus or not.   People who stay home in the last 2-3 months got Stimulus check and I think most of them actually make more money by staying home than go to work. So that money will either go into Stock Market or gambler.  Here in Denmark we already opened up restaurant and from what I can see people slowly go out and eat more and more and its been like 2 weeks after restaurant was allowed to opens.|2020-06-03 13:12:33

sqostw|gvr9zj|gvr9zj|13|This isn’t going to end well.  I’ve seen this before.  The market is attempting to convince you that the dips will always be bought.  And one of these times it will plummet through support and it will be difficult to change your perception that the trend is changing.  Only to find yourself buying dip after dip because it’s such a deal.  The media has ample ammo to convince you that movement to the downside is rational and could be sustained for a long time.

You should know that the majority of investors and institutions are bearish right now.  They are going to put more and more money into the market as it goes higher and higher. Driving it even higher. FED is also pumping.  Obviously this is happening by gold and 10 year being down and up respectively.  QE is bringing the dollar down which brings equities up. Economy is reopening and is better than projected.  All of this is bullish. Stop looking at projections and numbers from March and April.  Trump’s re-election hinges on the economy being open and stocks being higher than ever. He’s unethical, he’ll do whatever it takes to do that.  So obviously stop fucking buying puts.

srmvkm|gvr9zj|gvr9zj|3|So tell me why SNAP isn't way undervalued.  Instagram is great but SNAP has shown it's growing its userbase.  Companies still need to advertise to young consumers. People don't watch TV anymore. Twitter is becoming too political and may be coming under Section 230 sanction for acting as a publisher.  SNAP is by its nature less political and more advertiser-friendly, plus it's a video platform and video ads make money.  SNAP is down today because it's saying it won't promote Trump's account, which is dumb because (1) nothing wrong with Trump's account (2) that's what landed Twitter in hot water (3) I highly doubt Trump's Snapchat account has much visibility anyway.  So why do that? lol  But that aside, seems like today's dip is a buying opportunity|2020-06-03 12:27:35

There’s a table that always comes up black! You’re gonna be so damn rich!” You smile and nod.  You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.  As you lay your cash down and load up on puts you give Big Jay a wink. "Red".

If you like modeling, start pricing in a Biden victory using unemployment as a proxy.

srqw6l|gvr9zj|gvr9zj|2|People dying off in the millions is actually good for the economy when you think about it, especially when its old folks. Their productivity is likely less than the younger and more flamboyant gay bears. Also, their wealth passes down to their offspring who are more likely to yeet it on a tsla cybertruck, lulu tights, or their favorite IG thot. Those deaths will also create job openings so unemployment numbers will go down even more. America's economy does well when there is death and destruction all around.

The Zoom conference is about to begin for the investment team at ABC Capital. "How did ZM do on earnings after hours last night?" asks the boss.  Analyst replies "Over 100% increase in revenue thanks to COVID!". Great, he thinks. Lets keep our eye on it.  The meeting ends around 10AM. Bossman asks the analyst for a copy of ZMs earnings report and footage from their earnings call. Analyst digs it up and shoots him an email. "What the fuck is this?" he thinks to himself, after turning up his volume to hear the CEOs voice over the static of the Zoom recording. "Holy fuck, I can't understand any of this and the app looks stupid as fuck. This app fucking sucks. Alexa, order my whole sales team Microsoft Office so they can have a professional video meeting application to meet clients with. Also, remind me to to short my ZM position 50%"  We are here at 11AM EST   Later today, bossman will read the ER and shit his pants as he ensures his and his firms entire ZM position is liquid by EOD.

AND, as less than stellar forward looking projections don’t show a V rebound, stocks correct.   The only unknown is the fed printing and buying everything.

Call Buy = lose your cash?  Call Sell = Woo hoo?  Put Buy = ? no buyers after announcement so lose?  Put Sell = Woo hoo (provided you go way out to $1 or so - not hold $20 strikes and get forced to buy as it gets delisted)?  Cheers|2020-06-03 09:24:49

The judge said that Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook falsely praised iPhone demand results on a November 1, 2018 analyst call, just a few days before Apple tamed its production and added that the shareholders can sue over him.  She said that "it is simply implausible that Cook would not have known that iPhone demand in China was falling mere days before cutting production lines."|2020-06-03 10:32:50

srh4kz|gvr9zj|gvr9zj|1|Working on a new technique.   Bought 7 FB contracts on the dip. 135c 6/19. For 3.75.   It was a little shaky after that. I sold 3 at 3.90. This lowered my cost for the other 4 to 3.64. Plus my willingness to lose 10 percent on a day trade. Put my sell point at 3.30 or so.   Makes me breathe a little easier.   It’s why I always prefer to get more contracts. Which also means I can’t trade TSLA or any of the bigger names.  Edit: sold another at 4.05. So cost on remaining three is 3.50  Edit: sold another at 3.95 FB dipped. Cost basis on remaining 2 is 3.43.|2020-06-03 11:43:02

What once seemed sensible is starting to baffle even them. The S&P 500 is up 39% in 50 days and in the midst of its longest winning streak since February. A flattening virus curve, Federal Reserve stimulus and reopening plans explain a lot of it, they say. But with $7 trillion in value created and the Nasdaq 100 near a record, many big bulls are sounding distinctly...bearish.  The S&P 500 rose 1% as of 12:15 in New York. Here’s what a few investors who believed in the rally now have to say: Stranger Things  Peter Tchir’s bullish pronouncements amid the recent rebound have largely borne out. But for the head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, explaining why stocks keep going up is getting harder. Though the S&P 500 hasn’t yet breached 3,200 -- Tchir’s near-term target for the index, which he raised from 3,000 just last week -- he’s considering throwing in the towel nonetheless. His list of concerns include the escalating tiff between the U.S. and China, which is likely to escalate, the likely arc of of re-openings, and diminishing prospects for new stimulus. Tchir remains bullish but is reducing risk, he said on Wednesday.  “Normally I’m right there alongside whoever suggested tequila shots at midnight, but today, I’m going to quietly grab my jacket and leave before anyone notices I’m gone,” he wrote in a note. “Today has that feeling in the market. Bears capitulating left, right and center. I am not going to be fully short, but I am strongly in favor of reducing risk positions across equities and credit.”  Aggressive Assumptions  The market’s rally has been surprising but not unthinkable considering the fiscal and monetary measures already unleashed. But stocks have yet to start discounting what’s turning out to be a long list of worries, says Ralph Bassett, head of U.S. equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which has about $644.5 billion under management. Exogenous shocks, including a potential second wave of infections, could pose risks. His team is looking at tweaking their allocations but it’s proving difficult: sectors that could benefit coming out of a recession have already gotten expensive, he said in a phone interview.  “It just feels like markets aren’t discounting in risks to the downside at this stage -- at least to a meaningful degree,” he said. “You can certainly justify a lot of the rebound, particularly in cyclical stocks, but the assumptions to get there are aggressive in our view.”  Burgeoning Skepticism  Three days before the stock market bottom on March 23, Pacific Life Fund Advisors upped its exposure to risk. The Newport Beach-based money manager has remained optimistic since, but is now growing dubious.  According to Max Gokhman, Pacific Life Fund Advisors’ head of asset allocation, the firm’s “burgeoning skepticism” is a function of two developments. First, while economic indicators including jobless claims and PMIs are indeed improving, they aren’t accelerating at a rate that would back a V-shaped recovery. Also, new negative catalysts have emerged, from riots to U.S.-China tensions.  “Investor’s favorite horror franchise of the last two years is back -- Trade Wars: Return of the Tweet,” said Gokhman. “We start to see asymmetric risks to the downside with the S&P above 3,200, or just 200 points off its all-time highs.”  Turning Down the Dial  If bullishness could be mapped out on a scale from one to 10, Neil Dutta just turned down the dial from an 8 to a 7 -- or maybe a 6, he said. It’s not a drastic downgrade to his outlook but the head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research says the risks have ticked up a bit in recent days.  To Dutta, the mass protests and gatherings happening around the country heighten the potential for an increase in coronavirus cases, which, in turn, could complicate plans for re-openings. Sure, stocks are going up right now, making everyone feel better, he said, but “we had been thinking we’d open up nicely in the third quarter and that potentially puts that in doubt.”  Dutta added that it’s too early to tell whether protests will cause another wave of infections -- and that there are still plenty of things to be upbeat about, including positive trends in housing data as well as an easing in global conditions, particularly in Europe.|2020-06-03 12:51:01

I guess why would anybody buy to close when you can let it expire and collect more premium? somebody point out if im ultra retard or if i have that general idea right? i am fearful of closing the trade mechanics and making a mistake|2020-06-03 08:15:35

srz4v9|gvr9zj|gvr9zj|-1|Figured this would be a good place to ask, I’m still a little confused on this. Let’s say I place a call option on Robinhood and it’s expiring this Friday. It’s currently in the money. Do I have to sell it early to make profit? Also, if I don’t have the money to purchase the contract shares x100 when the option is exercised, does it expire worthless or simply sell at the price? Thank you|2020-06-03 14:00:58

sqhlov|gvr9zj|gvr9zj|-8|Previous Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuq5u0/about_simpson/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf   So as everyone knows, this information leaked, (previous thread) and people around the world have gone into a frenzy..... They have taken to the streets to demand action from Matt Groening, touted creator of Simpsons.... They will not rest until they get clues, Easter eggs, or hopefully answers to this groundbreaking info that changed the world of Simpson forever.  People from all walks of Simpson Nation have banded together to fight a common enemy: lack of understanding about Simpson. People wonder, “The show I’ve treasured, known and love, for years and years, is not what it seems to be... not after this new information has come to light..”  People are righteously angry. They want the truth. Some have even gone as far as to inflict violence on others, as Nelson has done to Milhouse, on numerous occasions throughout the show. Some people, convinced certain buildings contain clues to the mystery of Simpson, have begun breaking into these places and destroying them if they lack evidence.  While I do not condone riots and burning down buildings in the name of Simpson.... I understand the pain every SimpsonHead must be feeling.  We must have answers. So now, I personally call on you, Matt Groening, to deliver the much needed information on Simpson, I will not rest until You reveal the truth.......  Rioting is in our nature, not only human nature, but Simpson nature.....  Simpsons have rioted in so many episodes I can’t even keep count.  EXAMPLE https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0OVfjn-lrsk   I want to see you out in the street tonight, head to toe in Simpson Gear.  Let’s make a change in Simpson.....  Matt Groening, the ball is in your court.|2020-06-03 06:07:19
