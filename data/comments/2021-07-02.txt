I wouldn't even say bears are more retarded, because they base their shit off a lot of facts/macro theory. It's just that it hasn't worked in the last few years.  But now... now it's getting fucking ridiculous. Bears no where to be seen, bullied into oblivion on wsb lmao. And this market is fully detached from all sense of reasoning, and the valuation is approaching borderline unjustifiable. All signs of a bubble are there, gme/amc, etc. If spy hits 450 before end of the year, I'm 100% calling the whole stock market a bubble.  The time when this place is full of bears and bulls get called retarded instead... that's when i will buy. Problem is figuring out when that is. When is the pop? I am leaning towards it starting to unwind towards end of the year (50%+ correction) , but who knows.  also before u talk shit, i am fully invested on margin relax lmao|2021-07-02 12:44:33

3sv2lh|oc6yol|oc6yol|3|Lol.  Let‚Äôs put this in perspective.  The dollar strength was bearish until this week.  Then dollar strength turned bullish out of nowhere.  Until today.  Now dollar weakness is bullish.  Also, we‚Äôre going on 10 days straight of gains.  Something that has happened 22 times since 1928, or roughly 0.6% of the time over the last century.  Bears are getting a generational middle finger.  When will they learn that central bank liquidity injections don‚Äôt give a fuck about inflation, P/E ratios, RSI or anything.  Stocks go up until the world loses faith in the dollar.  Simple as that.  Take it to the bank|2021-07-02 08:19:45

3svt15|oc6yol|oc6yol|3|Today's UE report basically indicates that we should see a jobs boom that continues into the next 3 months (through September).  You have the reopening of businesses combined with the end of pandemic related benefits and eventual return of kids to school (freeing up parents to take jobs if they've been waiting on school year return).  Metals are moving up on the inflation angle (i.e. more people getting jobs than expected over next 3 months will put upward pressure on inflation).  Will be interesting to watch; JPow is going to keep saying inflation is transitory but we could see some much higher readings over next 3 months than expected.|2021-07-02 08:25:52

3srb9e|oc6yol|oc6yol|10|Unemployment rate went up because more people started looking for work than got jobs (on net).  i.e. If 850k people get jobs but 1 million rejoined labor force, that would actually lead to an increase in the unemployment rate.  The numbers come from 2 different surveys.   This was a super strong report and will likely lead to 2-3 more as strong as we head towards a return to normal school year.  Many parents of school age children will start looking for work in August-September as kids go back to school.   Should see 3 more reports of 750k+ jobs gained per month.|2021-07-02 07:46:18

3u7nr1|oc6yol|oc6yol|20|Storytime  This economic data looks grim, I think to myself. This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.  I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.  I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. "What am I-"  "Why did you short the domestic market?" he asks.  "Huh?" I respond, confused.  "Why did you short the domestic market?" he demands, louder this time.  "I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.  "It's priced in," he says coolly. "So why did you short the domestic market?"  Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. Impossible, I think to myself. "Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.  "Repeat after me: stocks only go up," Powell demands.  I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.  Powell frowns and continues, "I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?"  I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, "GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.  "Stocks only go up," Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.  The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.  "Stocks only go up," I say.|2021-07-02 14:03:04

3ud9ai|oc6yol|oc6yol|1|Why does my account show a huge gain if I can't exit my position?   In early June I entered into an $MSI 190-strike Put expiring July 16. I paid 1.00 for the contract. I've been down ever since and had accepted my loss. The price of the option was steadily decreasing, .70, .50, and so on.   Today I checked and in my account shows a 100% gain for the same option. The ask is posted at $2.15. Obviously I put an order in trying to exit my position asap.   I know that just cause the ask is posted there, does not mean it's the "real price" until someone buys it, and the volume on the option is super low.   I'm waiting for my order to go through but I'm almost certain it won't. It makes no sense why I would see green in my account if I can't exit my position. I did search the internet to make sense of it but it seems too vague an issue for anyone to provide an answer for me.|2021-07-02 14:44:04

By my definition, a bear is actively holding on to a large portion of cash (20% + of portfolio) to try not to participate in the market because they think it's gonna come down, or they are actively shorting. There is no one here doing this, and if you are, you're a fuckin clown lmao|2021-07-02 13:01:42

3t2wry|oc6yol|oc6yol|0|Good Morning Muthas I‚Äôm thinking  Eventually auto sales will rise a lot and 2 year leases will be up about 6-8 post Covid auto sales explosion. This will start the lease return flood for pre-owned in dealerships and auctions as well as some new cars for retention customers they want to keep, the  big bounce will be in 2023. Question is most companies lease you the car with XM 6 months free. You always continue the service‚Ä¶. Preowned Customers will sign up. How are you feeling about buying XM and waiting‚Ä¶.   Long post sorry  Any thoughts?|2021-07-02 09:21:25
