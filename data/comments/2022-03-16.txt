The China lockdowns should result in supply constraints on completed goods.  At the same time, it will reduce the domestic demand for oil and other commodities.

You scratch your week old shadow on your chin and wonder when you’ll pay for another gym visit, just so you can use the shower.  You look at today’s charts and laugh, banging on the steering wheel. You put out the cigarette you found at the bus stop ash tray, only half smoked, with the dregs at the bottom of your Luckin Coffee cup. Then you pick up the faded picture of your wife and kids and smile. These are the calls that will win them back.  Right?|2022-03-16 05:22:52

0vwxnk|tfe3hx|tfe3hx|7|Something that's been kinda overlooked is the big boost equities should see from EOQ rebalancing near EOM. Pension and sovereign wealth funds have to rebuild risk-on positions that have fallen in value with a potential $230B equity-buying spree that could boost equity markets by as much as 10%. These money managers that form the backbone of the investing community typically rebalance their market exposures every quarter in order to obey strict allocation limits between stocks and bonds.  This end of quarter rebalancing will be the biggest since 2020 in terms of buying equities. An inflow of at least $100B and as much as $230B could trigger huge gains in equities. The rout that hit equities in March 2020 left real-money portfolios underweight stocks by as much as $850B, sparking a buying binge that helped deliver gains of 13% in the S&P 500 the following month. Correction has put equity benchmarks from Europe and Asia briefly into bear markets with declines approaching 20% from their recent peaks, and the S&P 500 has peak-to-trough losses of about 12%.  These declines have driven down the value of targeted allocations for the world’s biggest funds, many of which hew to a traditional mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. To address the shortfall, they have to buy equities. US defined benefit pension plans which manage $7 trillion of assets would need to shift $126 billion into equities to meet their long-term targets. Japan’s $1.6T GPIF, the world’s largest pension fund, would have to buy $40B of equities to get back to its target asset allocation. The $1.3T Norwegian Oil Fund could move $22B from bonds to shares while the Swiss National Bank could buy $15B worth of stocks. Pension fund rebalancing has helped stock rallies in the last week of the quarter in previous bear markets|2022-03-16 09:08:40

Analysts estimated stockpiles of gasoline fell about 1.6 million barrels last week. Distillate inventories , which include diesel and heating oil, were expected to have decreased by about 1.8 million barrels.

CCP keeps having to put out fires from evergrande and multiple devlopers blowing up to intervening to prevent their stock markets from crashing further.  However, where there's smoke there is a fire.  China may be on the verge of a big multi-faceted meltup.  The CCP intervening to save the market still doesn't change the fact that tech giants like baba and JD saw slowing growth.  Something stinks and it ain't gonna go away even with intervention.  They gotta try to maintain stability as long as they can before Xi gets renominated this year. Who knows how that will go.|2022-03-16 09:18:43

0wxlk2|tfe3hx|tfe3hx|3|If this rate hike backfires they will prevent it from backfiring today, maybe even the rest of this week.  They need to make people believe only a small dip for now is the consequence of the rate hike.  Gives everyone else time to prepare an out, and then they will stop the props and let go, allowing the rug to blow out to sea.  That's how every other crash post hike has worked. Except Yellen, difference is there's nothing to use to slow the drop this time, because of 0% rates, a stilt held economy, and hefty money printing.   Now, it could be this week, I just don't think that's likely. They can probably stall for one more. But it'll definitely happen out of nowhere, all the crashes have.|2022-03-16 13:16:59

0wkxo9|tfe3hx|tfe3hx|5|This is why I love $SPY leaps.   Short term SPY calls are all toast but $SPY leaps purchased last summer are still up **20%** even after all these recent gap downs and volatility. This is why boomers always win.  Thinkorswim screen of position:   https://i.imgur.com/r1FTwXt.png  $SPY was engineered to **constantly go up** unlike all other ETFs in the sector.  To join the S&P500 the company needs to be **profitable for 4 consecutive quarters**!  Unprofitable garbage companies are delisted very quickly. Over the past decade, 50% of the S&P 500 has been replaced. If the trend continues, approximately **75% of companies on the index will be replaced by 2027**. Unprofitable companies are replaced with good profitable companies that work in the current economy! If we go to war they will add tons of defense stocks faster than you can blink.   SPY does not baghold unprofitable garbage like Cathie Woods.   #$SPY 20 DEC 2024 $695 CALLS  *Guaranteed by Jerome Powell, trust the Fed*|2022-03-16 11:52:22

Now they are being reactive & they are pretty much doing the equivalent of nothing. They have no tools left to stop a major downturn that can be caused by any number of factors. Inflation & debt will push us into a recession worse than 2008 & lack of leadership from government stooges will be the root cause.|2022-03-16 13:34:45

0vdat9|tfe3hx|tfe3hx|2|I wasn’t sure if this was a run up to jpow meeting or just a continued reaction to oil prices coming back down. Europe going up a lot too makes me think the latter, though a combination is likely the real answer. I think everyone at this point expects a .25 rate hike today so there’s little reason to expect a surprise there.   When jpow made the anticipated rate hike announcements last time around, the market behaved similarly, ripped the day before and in the immediate run up to the announcement, then dipped mid-speech because of some hawkish undertones in his language. I expect similar thing to happen this time. We have a major catalyst in the inevitable Ukraine peace talks in the coming 2 weeks or so so that was my thesis to eventually get calls. In the meantime I am considering puts immediately before jpow speaks.|2022-03-16 06:15:22

0vpo0i|tfe3hx|tfe3hx|1|It’s pretty obvious to anyone that can see through the present moral outrage that US sanctions on Russia are the beginning of the end of the dollar as the world reserve currency. China, the Saudis, UAE, and India are all working on a different system as we speak because the effectiveness of these sanctions has caused fear. Saudis even reportedly moving to accept yuan for oil for the first time ever. It seems our reaction to this crisis may lead to much more devastating effects than this war itself could conceivably cause, and that’s assuming we don’t end up in a war with Russia now that we’re allowing NATO countries to directly send Ukraine arms.|2022-03-16 08:13:01

0v7luv|tfe3hx|tfe3hx|-7|Stay in cash gang bois!!!  Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping after having risen, this is the most reliable indicator signaling significant moves in the stock market. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. The s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now) Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.  AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.  Bull cases: WW3 might not happen. Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-03-16 05:04:15

You couldn’t justify staying short on some of this tech after that beatdown the past two months.  Bears are getting too greedy.  How low do you think BABA could go when they have like 1/3 of their marker cap in cash?    Plenty others like that.
