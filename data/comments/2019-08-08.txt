I preached the 2915 top so I entered my puts today - 12k in:  09/04 2800Px5   08/14 2850Px4 (guilty pleasure)  The plan is to ride out whatever happens tomorrow (theory is that people won't risk holding long into the weekend) and hold until -50% at least. I think with non-accommodating fed that already corrected for trade uncertainty, awful data in europe, and China yet to respond properly to the escalation + trouble in HK, and earnings season behind us, we should drift a bit lower. The anti thesis is that market just rallies for no explainable reason so we collectively forget about all the bad news.|2019-08-08 14:20:20

wchsn5|cnk6um|cnk6um|10|After reading a few comments about oil, I remember this story I overheard at some restaurant in SF back in 2007. There's this couple on what seem to be a 1st or 2nd date, and the guy is going on about his "gas price lock-in" idea he's working on. Where it was essentially a forever gallon based gift card where you buy it today to lock in today's prices, so when gas inevitably hits $10-15 by 2020 you can use that gift card or whatever to pay for gas at essentially the price you paid in 2007. And his plan is he would stock up in 2007, because he "had about 200k to put into it". I don't think he's ever heard about derivatives or futures in his life.  Gas prices around here were about 4.60/gallon. Gas prices now are about 3.60/gallon. Not only are you technically lose $1/gallon, you're out $1.20/gallon when accounted inflation  I always wondered what happen to that guy. If he made an app for that back in 2012, he probably would've made it big and got bought out by some dumb dumb. I actually would've love to see how he would do with options if he knew about it.|2019-08-08 12:24:41

wd9m44|cnk6um|cnk6um|7|Okay finally got through the shareholder letter for FSLY:  Biggest issue seems to be that the FY 2019 revenue estimate is now $191-195 million.  I think most analysts were hoping for $200 million for full year revenue.  Knowing how these companies lowball, $197-198 million is probably their expectation now.  FY 2018 revenue was $144.5 million, so that's 36% growth.  That means growth will pick up a bit in 3rd and 4th quarters.  Feels like expectations were a bit too high based on their q1 2019; they'll probably need to explain away why q3-4 will be better than q2 to recover here.|2019-08-08 15:47:30

When was the last time you sat and watched discovery channel for over 30 minutes (housewives don't respond with your stupid serial killer murder shows) - **Fuck I did bad on this one (8/8)** * Turtle Beach - The past 4 earnings they dumped, every time.

wdcg1o|cnk6um|cnk6um|3|Robinhood seems to be getting slower every single day, am I the only one? iPhone XS.. I take care of my phone in terms of apps, storage cap, anything background related..  So, if it's not Snapchat, and it's not WeBull, and it's not an assortment of lame games I tested, I'd assume that means it's just Robinhood correct? It's an incredibly buggy, freezing, glitchy, slow, frustrating app to experience.  The desktop is wack as well but mobile and desktop have their own strengths and weakness in my opinion. Both have shared problems. I use TradingView Pro for most of my charting and TA  I wish WeBull had options. Maybe I should buck up and get a brokerage. But I'm already losing money, I don't need to spend $12 on a trade. If $12 makes or breaks your trade, you're probably not making any money, but $12 every trade adds up.  Idk..  **^(🦄)**  **🦄**  # 🦄  Someone tell me I'm right and that you're experiencing similar issues, or give me suggestions on the best price/value brokerages.|2019-08-08 16:08:48

wcrryj|cnk6um|cnk6um|2|here's a way to play FSLY. you buy the 8/16 22.50put for for 2.70. You buy 100 shares right now at 21.30. If FSLY tanks, you ask your broker to exercise the put:    -2130+2250-270=-150. Your max loss is $150.    Now if FSLY beats, then it just needs to reach 24/share   (-270 \[put\] - 2130 + 2400 = 0) for break even, and anything above is profit.   1. buy 100 shares of FSLY now.  2. Buy 8/16 22.50 put for around 2.70. 3. Max loss is $150bucks.  4. Break even is FSLY beats on ER and gets to 24.  5. anything above 24 is profit.|2019-08-08 13:36:20

wcbgxk|cnk6um|cnk6um|4|PSA to losers using RH with PDT  Did you know commodities don't have a PDT restriction? If you switch to a real broker like IB that lets you trade futures, you can enter and exit as you please and feed your gambling addiction nearly 24/7, as long as you meet the margin requirements  It's a pretty smart move if your account is near the PDT threshold. When you screw up your FDs, just exit them and switch to scraping futures until you're over the PDT threshold again, and switch back to trading securities  with micro futures, you can do this with a lot less capital|2019-08-08 11:29:35

I sold 2 calls before earnings, the total credit was 160 and they expired worthless. Now the calendar spread got converted to just calls after that, but it shows I'm way down on the "overall", but I don't think this accounts for the credit from the calls (because if it was used to offset the cost of the calls I bought). So i think, even though it says I'm "down" $160 on my current calls, I'm actually up whatever I can sell them for because of the previous credit. Right?|2019-08-08 10:02:23

wd5wkp|cnk6um|cnk6um|-1|Wish I could afford to play Uber, knew they were going down bigly on loss of market share but too poor for companies where options only trade in 5 cent increments, especially after all my losses today.  Every day lately I'm making no money and seeing other people making bank after market close on things I'd be in on too but couldn't. Yesterday it was AMD's epyc event that I didn't find out about until after close, which hurts even more now because if someone had just posted about that before close or I'd had a bit of luck and randomly thought to check what they're doing, then today I'd have been able to afford a put on Uber.  Adding up all my losses and remembering all the times I knew what to do with the best options opportunities but couldn't afford the risk of the premiums or just straight-up didn't have the buying power for them, it makes me want to cry wondering how rich I would be today if my start at New Years had just been a tiny bit better than a minimum wage job. Let alone if I had been able to start sooner and with less risk pressure. This place increases my chances at turning it around and making some money but it's also so painful seeing so many people with so much money being idiots and successfully using their wealth advantage to hold me down at the bottom while they do retarded bullshit and yet call themselves retarded only sarcastically, thinking they're actually smarter because they think "smart" means "given lots of money" instead of "high intelligence." Also sucks how these frustrations can barely be spoken of because so many sadistic retards like to start bullying as soon as they see signs of vulnerability like this.|2019-08-08 15:20:27
