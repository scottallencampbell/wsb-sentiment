07a69l|i2upp0|i2upp0|39|You stuff the butt of your cigarette into the Luckin Coffee cup sitting in the cup holder of your Hertz rental car. You open the glove box, searching for a feeling. A dozen Kodak film canisters spill onto the floor mat. You pick one up and shake it, smiling at the reassuring swooshing liquid sound. You pop off the light gray cap and let the chemical aroma fill your nose. You hesitate. This is the last play. The last chance to get her and the kids back. With your free hand, you grab your phone and open the Robinhood app. You notice you have 4% battery life, and your hands start shaking. You take a deep breath. You drink the Clorox® Disinfecting Bleach in the film canister. You place your order: 100 CLX 8/7 245Cs. --   ^^Yes, ^^I ^^posted ^^this ^^in ^^the ^^weekend ^^thread, ^^but ^^I ^^thought ^^this ^^morning's ^^CLX ^^bed-shitting ^^made ^^it ^^funnier. ^^RIP ^^you.|2020-08-03 07:45:47

07bso4|i2upp0|i2upp0|14|MSFT is going to announce some retarded gaming shit like a partnership with Nintendo and Steam within the next two years.   They're transitioning away from a "Console Wars" mindset and trying to just integrate MSFT services into competitor's business models.   People buying Nintendo are buying Nintendo, people playing on PC are playing on PC. They're not buying an Xbox (or if they are, it's in *addition* to those other systems), and nothing is changing that. Doesn't mean MSFT can't profit off of them.   Aside from this MSFT is a powerhouse company that is literally going nowhere. Teams is an integral part of a vast majority of businesses in the nation now.   MSFT is a tech company that is expanding consistently at a controlled, planned pace. That's a fucking rarity rn.|2020-08-03 08:04:20

This is a recent interview with the senior vice president of the st louis fed, and he makes it very clear that the fed has to keep stocks from crashing, and that anybody who thinks the fed does not pump stocks is retarded. They are also held in pension funds so they need to keep them propped up to promote spending.

07fma3|i2upp0|i2upp0|5|Trump in a hardcore pissing match with China.  Trump says he’s going to ban TikTok.  Trump doesn’t ban TikTok because Microsoft is going to buy it. Trump comes out and says he opposed the deal. Microsoft starts to backpedal on deal. China wants TikTok sold to Microsoft. Trump wants to make China sweat a little to remind them who’s boss. The first big red day we have this week trump will tweet that he’s talked with China, Microsoft, and TikTok and “some arrangements have been made” and he now supports the deal between Microsoft and TikTok. “This is a step forward with China” he will throw in at the end. Microsoft rallies causing the entire market to fucking moon. Im a fucking idiot but I think I have this one right. And I also own 0 Microsoft calls. But that will change tomorrow. Some will say that it’s a theory that’s way out there and your betting on a lot of shit to fall into place.  But if you buy calls a month+ out there’s little to no risk at all. There’s no chance Microsoft is tanking anytime soon so your calls won’t go to zero and the reward could be huger than donnies dick and balls.|2020-08-03 08:43:04

08ai36|i2upp0|i2upp0|4|In my opinion PRPL is highly undervalued because is has such a low P/S (price-sales) ratio. In the other ratios such as PE and PEG, accounts for actual net profit which is inaccurate because PRPL is spending alot on R&D and advertising currently. P/S ratio is more accurate because it takes into account that PRPL is a true growth stock. PRPL has a lower PS ratio than almost all of blue chip companies. It could easily turn huge amounts of profit and have a low PE and PEG ratio if they stopped expanding and spending on growth. Correct me if im wrong.|2020-08-03 12:15:15

07ultw|i2upp0|i2upp0|1|So question for someone much smarter than I.   So hypothetically the fed continues pumping more and more money, stimulus talks go well and gets approval, which pumps the market up higher.   Generally when the market is boosting up, metals go down in price as people are buying more stock than metals.   But all the pumping of money causes the dollar to go down, which should make metals go up(in most cases)   Then in theory should we find a point where metals are just stale and flat, meanwhile the bubble just grows until both take a shit out?|2020-08-03 10:36:28

ByteDance has not publicly confirmed the sale talks. But in an internal letter to staff on Monday seen by Reuters, the company’s founder and CEO Zhang Yiming said the firm had started talks with a tech company it did not identify to clear the way “for us to continue offering the TikTok app in the U.S.”  Clinching a deal that will satisfy all parties and potentially act as a lightning rod for U.S.-China relations will be a tall order.   https://reut.rs/2XlKQK1   Bet safely|2020-08-03 11:52:04

07b3ye|i2upp0|i2upp0|-1|Haha I get it dude. I am going against my own rule here to never buy an otc stock with this. But this also trades in Canada, Germany etc. Not a typical pos otc play.  With a legit FDA approved Phase III Covid trial about to begin and being at such a low market cap all I'm saying is this has lots of room to run.|2020-08-03 07:56:26

07gopp|i2upp0|i2upp0|-1|So maybe i shouldnt share my free money secret but here goes;  ETHE is a trust that holds the digital koin of the same name. When the underlying koin goes up while the market is closed, you can put in buy orders slightly above market for ETHE, and they have been filling for me. Just dont get too greedy and put your bid too low, you gotta leave some room. I've been playing this for months this way.|2020-08-03 08:52:33

08lmdr|i2upp0|i2upp0|-10|I seriously doubt this TikTok deal will go through. There's yuge chinese domestic market that ByteDance can't afford losing. Its competitors, which are desperate to see ByteDance fail, can play the patriotic card saying ByteDance is selling their soul to foreign authorities and the Chinese TikTok is now a US spyware. Even though the deal is only about the US operation. Banning a specific app through executive orders really gonna hurt the fReE mARkEt. Even China has made laws about how foreign companies should operate there. FB and Google refuse to obey the law so they got banned while LinkedIn, Apple operate fine. This forced acquisition looks like a robbery.  I'm dumping MSFT shares.|2020-08-03 13:20:40
