lwll9n|lbl62i|lbl62i|37|Y'all, I'm not a part of this community, but I'd just like to say, *I believe in you guys.*  &#x200B;  Not only do you have hedge funds scrambling and trying to make the GME stock go down in worth, but you got people like **Mark Cuban actively telling you to hold the line and to keep buying GME when you can if you can afford it.**  &#x200B;  ***The whole world is helping you. Everyone around the world is buying GME with you to fuck over hedge funds.***  &#x200B;  This isn't just about money, this is about taking back what hedge funds are constantly stealing from regular people through their bullshit shorting. This is *bigger* than just money; *this is about sending a message that you won't stand for shorting or hedge funders stealing money and betting on people's lives getting ruined.*  &#x200B;  ***Everyone's rooting for you guys.***  &#x200B;  The hedge funders are going to try and pull every trick in the book to try and make you buy other stocks that aren't being shorted, or to make you think you're losing.  &#x200B;  **Don't fall for the tricks.** Hold the line and buy more GME if you can afford to do so. If you have to find another app or anything to be able to buy more GME do it as soon as you can, but my God, *buy more GME and hold the line.*  &#x200B;  **The world believes in you. We're all rooting for you to take these hedge funders down.**  &#x200B;  ***BUY GME AND HOLD THE LINE WITH DIAMOND HANDS, YOU GLORIOUS APES! TAKE GME TO THE MOON!***  &#x200B;  (Sorry, I don't know how to do emojis on here.)|2021-02-03 14:33:46

lvavt3|lbl62i|lbl62i|27|*REPOST At this point, GME, AMC et al. are trading with the type of volatility weekly options usually do. Seasoned WSB people freaking out: come on, you're better than this. How many times have you been down 90% on a trade and just said fuck it may as well let it go to 0, something crazy could happen. And if you've been irresponsibly trading options long enough, you know - sometimes it does, and your -90% position goes to +200% in minutes based on a tweet from Trump or Elon or some other random factor. Well get it through your head that these are fucking SHARES. They don't expire, there's no theta decay, and they don't require a perfectly timed miracle to regain value. Remember when shares around here were boring and for pussies and people were openly mocked for even buying them when they could have bought options? Calm your tits and act like the degenerate gamblers you are instead of flipping out because you're losing money on a trade. THAT'S NORMAL HERE REMEMBER??  Newbies, volatility is the bread and butter of WSB. If your portfolio isn't fluctuating wildly in one direction or the other on an hourly basis, or if you don't want it to, go hang with r/investing. Buy into some bonds and mutual funds and retire at 67 with just enough to maintain a living wage until you die. But that's not what this place has ever been about. The endgame has ALWAYS been yacht or food stamps, this isn't new. A few get rich, most go broke. But everyone who goes broke does it with dignity while trying to get rich, and most importantly posts loss porn for us all.  What's gonna happen to all these stocks? I have no fucking idea. I'm holding my GME because if there's one thing I've learned over the years it's that no matter what I'm trading the second I sell for a loss, the shit miraculously recovers. Maybe I'm on a sinking ship, but at this point I've ridden enough sinking ships to the bottom of the ocean to not give a fuck.  💎🤚🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-03 09:19:20

There are some that came here with dreams and hopes. There are some that came to see what goes on in this forum. And there are some that came to bet spread disinformation, cast doubt, spy on our ideas, and mislead many of the inexperienced.  There are scanners that pick up on our ticker mentions and that provides insight to hedge companies that are paying for this software. Making stock tickr mentions on Reddit is working against us right now. Unless we mention a bunch of bogus stock tickers and use pictures instead of typing them out, some douche bag is going to make a lot of money selling software to hedge companies that scan our subreddit for tickr mentions.

lwrnmc|lbl62i|lbl62i|29|serious question here (and I OWN GME, just being devil's advocate) is it possible the squeeze already occured last thursday? (or at least some of it) i'm mostly examining the vol charts  the WEIRD thing is that AFTER the huge spike up to the 300s/400s, there was like no vol. also tell me how we dove from that 450 peak to 200 on only around 1mil total vol, when it took us 5 mil + to get up there? this defenitely does NOT look like a traditional squeeze. Actually, if you look into the weeks leading up to last week, there was even more volume. just don't see where or how the shorts covered  I just don't get it, something fishy about these charts.|2021-02-03 15:14:38
lxc05y|lbl62i|lbl62i|29|I’m hearing more contracts come up tomorrow?!   And there’s a huge push to get retail sellers to sell in the next 48 to minimize even more losses.  The hedge funds are sold short on margin, so their trigger to buy back out of their short position will change daily. Every time the stock goes up, more shares go into a margin call requiring the hedge fund to cover their short. Additionally, they’re paying interest on that margin so every day they hold they bleed. For example, every day citadel holds it is costing them $11 million in interest.  So the goal is to hold out long enough to squeeze the first hedge fund which will buddy fuck the other hedges forcing them to cover.  Right now, they are trading low volume back and forth at a loss to try and bleed retail dry so they give up on the squeeze and close their positions.  But tomorrow EOD should squeeze a little as it’s a contract expiration for shorts|2021-02-03 17:45:05

luobq8|lbl62i|lbl62i|55|From S.Korea. Noob investor. I started investing about 6 months ago. I recently heard about GME and bought about 7 stocks now. After the dip from last night I was totally freaked out but still gonna HOLD.  Here are some of my insights :  When they block you from buying = They are afraid of you buying even 1 stock  When they say you should sell your stocks = They are desperate for you to sell your stocks  When they say its over = They so want this situation to be over  &#x200B;  I am no expert like you guys, and I am no diamond hand. But my gut feeling says  even though I lose all my money, We're gonna give them a real fuckin headache to get away  with this.  I'm so gonna HOLD.|2021-02-03 05:55:03

lukey7|lbl62i|lbl62i|161|The flavors of the month since the March crash:      **March**: SPY puts/VXX calls   **April**: Loss porn from SPY puts/VXX calls, Tanker gang     **May**: Vaccine plays (MRNA, SRNE, PFE, JNJ, NVAX, etc)   **June**: Airlines, REITs   **July**: TSLA (for battery day), Clang gang   **August**: TSLA/AAPL (split), tech (Softbank)   **September**: Bear month   **October**: EV explosion (NIO, XPEV, LI, etc)   **November**: TSLA (SPY inclusion), PLTR   **December**: Brypto   **January**: Short Squeezes      Unfortunately, this place is beyond redemption after the influx of about 6.5 million new members.

luxb2w|lbl62i|lbl62i|20|I am hearing these idiots on CNBC singing the regulation tune. Now they know what we are capable of, and they want to do everything in their power to prevent us from repeating it. I call upon all of you to remember that this was us, a society oppressed by Billionaires, we took matters into our own hands, we made money, and when the brokerages' companies stepped in to protect the billionaire, we almost saw it coming. I made a great deal of money on $GME and I am not scared of losing. The former Dallas fed official on CNBC is comparing r/wsb to the US capitol mob. Hold on strong... $GME will fall but we will soon find our target.|2021-02-03 07:33:28
luzlzr|lbl62i|lbl62i|20|Anybody going on twitter to follow S3 and Ihor, please don't bash the guy over his GME posts.  He's been extremely helpful to us around here on previous squeezes like the BYND squeeze and what happened to the shorts during TSLA's run up.  He provides free proprietary data to us, and it's extremely valuable data about what his firm sees as the positions of hedge funds and the like with respect to these extreme short positions.  We'll need him in the future too for future short squeezes.   [https://twitter.com/ihors3](https://twitter.com/ihors3)  <-- for those wondering.|2021-02-03 07:54:01

lv4yfd|lbl62i|lbl62i|18|    Lock up those shares …..  Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 08:36:45

Since I joined WSB, the first time since the beginning of 2020 I began to feel sprinkles of hope again. What. I knew this feeling back from my childhood. I really begin to think that people can make great changes when we have faith in eachother and start working together. This whole ride on GME with great apes from all over the planet is just amazing. The ride must go on. We have No other choice than choose faith over giving up and settle for less. Apes are born to live in freedom. Not in captivity.

Stay true and buy/hold pony boy 🐎   “The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day’s close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. The rule applies to all equity securities whether traded on an exchange or over the counter. The short-sale rule restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day’s close.”|2021-02-03 09:08:51

I'm guessing there are lots of people like me though, who always thought of stocks as something only rich guys do and are intrigued now. I'm seeing this as a new hobby that may or may not make me money, but it's fun.    Y'all really did something . You introduced millions of people to the market and that's powerful.

luklpo|lbl62i|lbl62i|52|I don’t exactly understand when they actually should have closed their short positions. I feel like their whole plan of scaring the retail investors seems to be working. There is this mentality that the thing is over but all I see the last days are short latter attacks, propaganda about silver and that they have closed their positions. If they would actually have done that why bother telling everyone about it, why trying to bring the media’s attention to silver?  For me some things aren’t adding up at the moment|2021-02-03 05:03:21

lw0sym|lbl62i|lbl62i|15|I spent yesterday buying the dips on AMC and lowering my cost basis. Four reasons I’m bullish on AMC:  •Zack’s upgraded them to a Strong Buy last week   • Blackrock disclosed yesterday owning 6.2m shares (increased their original position by almost 60%)  •AMC announced yesterday that they’re starting to open theaters back up  •I’ve repeatedly heard friends, family, and strangers over the past few weeks talk about how the first thing they’re doing once it’s safe to do so is get back to the movies. Even though everyone has gotten used to streaming, I see people missing the experience of going to the movies.  Im realistic, I think this is a longer term play and I don’t think there’s going to be a short squeeze situation like GME, but I do think this could see a decent pop this year as things try to get back to normal  *not financial advice, just what I’m doing*|2021-02-03 12:13:48

It is so fucking obvious they are trying to make us bored, and make the impatient ones sell at a low price. DO NOT SELL to realise the loss, because there's no loss until you sell bro. I have full confidence that at least a micro squeeze need to happen.

lvmtkr|lbl62i|lbl62i|15|gme in grid lock due to illiquidity.   its a hold and wait game and see who buckles first.      Reposting from bloomberg:  institutional investors own 113,664,181 shares of gamestop right now. That's 162.97% of the 71 million that actually exist. -source: https://fintel.io/so/us/gme  https://fintel.io/so/us/gme Individual investors likely hold between 10-40 million shares. It's difficult to gauge, but these numbers are based on the Wall Street Bets Forum membership of 2 million, where each member owns between 5-20 shares. These numbers are extremely conservative. Most members prefer higher risk/higher reward and possibly have the entirety of the actual outstanding GME shares and more. Furthermore, the forum has now grown to 8 million subscribers, most eager to be a part of what they see as the greatest opportunity to win playing the same game as the hedge funds for the first time. (And maybe last)  Shares currently held by investors (not short sellers): Low - 123 million or 173% Mid - 153 million or 215% High - 184 million 259%  These particular investors aren't in any hurry and understand the consequences of their investment strategy and that of the short sellers. The shorts massively overreached and will eventually need to repay their borrowed shares.  Does it look likely they'll be able to do that if the total number of investors is more than 200%?|2021-02-03 10:41:36

lxholl|lbl62i|lbl62i|30|It looks like morale is going down today compared to the last couple of days. Seeing a lot of people who bought on the last peak and were hoping for a quick, cheap, and easy win now becoming disheartened.  Welcome to the stock market. There's a reason buying stocks is called a "long" position. You have to be in it for the long haul if you want to win. If you're thinking you can predict the future (or that the future has been predicted for you) you're setting yourself up for disappointment.   I consider any money I put in to be lost assets. A loss doesn't hurt, because technically any amount of value is greater than 0, and so exceeds my set expectations. There is a squeeze coming, or happening right now. A spike isn't a guarantee, there are two possibilities I see; either the companies are forced to buy and we see a spike as the hedge funds take a big L. OR, the hedge funds try to pay back the borrowed shares slowly over time, bleeding out gradually as they try to spread the pain of loss over a period of time.  The first scenario is better for the investor looking for a payout. Either one is good for the investor looking to beat hedge funds at this game. But that uncertainty is bad for the cynical opportunist looking for a guaranteed profit. Never put in more than you're willing to lose. there is no such thing as a sure thing.|2021-02-03 18:31:17

In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.    In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.     I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.|2021-02-03 05:58:26

lwdld2|lbl62i|lbl62i|24|For those of u who are having doubts on amc. In august 2018 to october 2018 amc was around $20 a share. And for most of 2019 it was around 15 on average imo from a rough estimate. So regardless you will make profit when the world gets back to normal. Even tho the stay at home streaming services are there winning like crazy. We all know that theres definitely multiple reasons why people prefer the theatres when it comes to movies.  Edit: im no financial advisor, just making assumptions based off current societal situations|2021-02-03 13:38:50
lwe1go|lbl62i|lbl62i|29|There was no sell off, it was literally market manipulation  They regulated purchases, which didn't let the demand be met, restrict sells, price goes up, restrict buys, price goes down  This proves they still have a massive naked short interest yet to be seen, otherwise they'd let the free market deal with us, "some will win, some will lose" type thing, they need the price down because we have them by the fucking balls💎👊💎👊💎👊💎👊💎👊💎👊🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  BUY & HOLD AMC/GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀👊💎👊💎👊🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍|2021-02-03 13:41:57

lw7wjo|lbl62i|lbl62i|10|I just got off the phone with Vanguard.  I was calling because I received an error message that my account had insufficient funds for the trade I was making, when the screen also showed my "funds available to trade" were five times the amount I wanted to trade. I was told that they have a brand new policy that those funds were only "available to trade" for Vanguard funds and not stocks. The representative said that I had to wait an additional day (8 days total) to use those funds to trade stocks. Last week I was able to buy stocks with funds I transferred within 3 days.  I am generally a long-term investor in my Roth IRA, and only trade in my taxable account on the side, but the GME drama has revealed how out of date the Vanguard platform is, and on top of that, they are now implementing regressive policies regarding when I can access my own money. It's sad to see this happen, but I am looking into changing over to Fidelity for both accounts as they are much more up to date.  And yes, I will be waiting to transfer my Roth over until I see what happens with GME/AMC.  💎👐  🚀|2021-02-03 13:00:18

Can I infer, from the data, that  they have largely been unable to close out their short positions? In  fact, the cocky buggers seem to be shorting MORE stock.

luq78o|lbl62i|lbl62i|31|    Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 06:18:35

lvnb2g|lbl62i|lbl62i|20|I know that we're all hoping for a squeeze on AMC, but I just wanted to reassure my fellow diamond fisted apes that if it doesn't happen, we could all stand to profit in the long term.  AMC is a strong company. It's been a tough year for them (to say the least) but they will weather the storm. They've been around for a century and with the new sources of funding, they'll continue to weather the storm.  AMC, at it's peak in the past 5 years, was $35 in 2017. It's since declined since the soaring of streaming, but in 2019 it still saw a high of $15.  I firmly believe that once we're back to "normal", the stock will stabilize and we'll see prices similar to what we were seeing a few year ago, especially since AMC has adopted a wildly popular subscription based model.  I currently hold 50 shares at $13 per, and I'm confident that I will see a return on my investment in the next few years even if we don't squeeze. We may have a had a few red days, but I think it's uphill from here.  Please know that I am far from a financial advisor and am new the the stock market myself. I just believe in AMC and love the stock!  Edit: wanted to add that BlackRock's investment is testament to their faith in the stock! they seem to love it too!!|2021-02-03 10:44:52

If they did not buy, they are forced into auto buying today Lots of money transfers clearing today - Paper hands have been shaken out, especially around 100 usd stop limits - 800 calls bought for ~22Million - Restrictions (partially) lifted at RobinHood, Tradeup, Revonlut - S3 stating this is costing Hedgefunds even more than it is costing us AND it can be the possible start of the SECOND SQUEEZE if we buy in: https://s3partners.com/exclusive3.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=020221&utm_campaign=10ds  - short interest still ridiculous ~120% - Why all the FUD, short ladder attacks, fake silver squeeze etc. if they are not in danger? - Short positions cost 50% interest new positions vary between 16%-20%|2021-02-03 07:34:21

I am now seeing AMC shilling with times to buy (manipulation), it would not be a surprise if the hedges are botting this in a dirty attempt to get the subreddit shut down.  What are your thoughts?

lule11|lbl62i|lbl62i|29|Got late to the party @320 average and currently holding 8 GME. Now this is money I told myself I could lose but still mixed emotions on monday when it plummeted. Should I have gotten out earlier when the losses were still low?   Then yesterday my mindset changed when it was sitting $90, I knew that at this point I'd have lost anyway if I'd sell, so why not just enjoy the ride?   In other words: I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL 🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-03 05:14:37

luovpc|lbl62i|lbl62i|9|   100 miles deep in the Earth, a layer separating our hospitable exterior from the molten core, known as the mantle, is where diamonds were made. **Temperatures boiled above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure exceeded 725,000 pounds per square inch.**  The extreme heat and pressure combined actually modified graphite, a crystalline carbon, on the atomic level. This restructured graphite’s molecular composition from a hexagonal sheet pattern into a triangular shape, resulting in diamond.  Lucky for us, nature also has a method of transporting these valuable minerals from deep within the Earth to the surface––volcanic pipes. Deep-source volcanoes start three times as deep as typical volcanoes. **The high levels of magnesium and carbon dioxide force the magma to the surface, resulting in a violent eruption.**|2021-02-03 06:02:17

luozt5|lbl62i|lbl62i|40|# If you feel anxious about $GME, get an alert app and disconnect for a while.   Paraphrasing Mark Cuban, "If you still believe in why you bought the stock, hold the stock"  These last few days have been exhausting mentally for many people in the community. If you plan on holding the stock, even if the price keeps dipping, just set an alert on a certain price and get some shit done. Do some work, study some, go to the gym or take a day off. If the alert hits you then come back. Setting yourself back mentally in this game will not help you! And we must support each other in relaxing a bit.  TL;DR Monkey staring at screen too much? Monkey feel bad? Monkey still hold? Download app that tell you when banana big and take monkey day off. Other monkey not going anywhere.  &#x200B;  **Spread this please.**|2021-02-03 06:03:48

lurk6l|lbl62i|lbl62i|18|Pre-market volatility today was something to watch. Up and down 10% - whilst I do not have any information on hand, it does beg the question of why it is so choppy. If we learn anything from this, it is that we must have far greater transparency of the whole market, including the shadow banking industry.         Next week's reporting on Short Interest declared yesterday will be interesting to see. I do appreciate the data will be old by the time we get to see it, but nonetheless looking back and understanding what happened will be a useful learning experience.  https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/|2021-02-03 06:34:30

lv6s68|lbl62i|lbl62i|17|I spent yesterday buying the dips on AMC and lowering my cost basis. Four reasons I’m bullish on AMC:  •Zack’s upgraded them to a Strong Buy last week   • Blackrock disclosed yesterday owning 6.2m shares (increased their original position by almost 60%)  •AMC announced yesterday that they’re starting to open theaters back up  •I’ve repeatedly heard friends, family, and strangers over the past few weeks talk about how the first thing they’re doing once it’s safe to do so is get back to the movies. Even though everyone has gotten used to streaming, I see people missing the experience of going to the movies.  Im realistic, I think this is a longer term play and I don’t think there’s going to be a short squeeze situation like GME, but I do think this could see a decent pop this year as things try to get back to normal  *not financial advice, just what I’m doing*|2021-02-03 08:50:11

Having a near panic attack I fled to the bathroom to get rid of the feeling in my stomach from nearly shitting all over my pants and legs.   When I went to wipe, I felt a prick in my hand and out of the toilet paper dispenser came a used syringe a junkie had left there. At first I panicked, but the junkie must have left some of the good stuff in there because now I associate needles with a warm, cozy feeling.

Except for when I went to buy GME on Friday, apparently it charged the old account, so in the meantime of GME crashing, my account is now negative because the security has crashed and my deposit never went through.   So what happens? They turn off my instant deposits so I can't settle my account and can't open new positions. What also happens?

lum3yf|lbl62i|lbl62i|40|   I am a student from Germany (18 y/o) and I bought some GME and AMC. So far so good, I am willing to lose the invested money, but I dreamt about coming to my mum and saying "I just afforded myself a drivers license". I know that she will support me if I don't get the money and whatever, but the idea of "earning" this without any help (only you reddit retards), is just amazing. I rather lose everything I invested than selling now. I read beatiful stories on here, saw funny memes and I'm just happy that I can be part of this movement. I'm holding till the end. Thank you guys.🚀  What is your story?|2021-02-03 05:24:55

First of all, it's ok that you don't know what you're doing, all of us had to start at some point. While you're sat panicking about holding and confused about what to do here's an idea. Take a deep breath, continue holding, buy the dip if you can afford to and while you've got spare time on your hands go onto Google and educate yourself about the stock market.  That way, over time you will be better equipped to make your own decisions rather than solely relying on what other people are saying.

lwcwk1|lbl62i|lbl62i|24|This stock in amc was 3 bucks like a week ago  and it’s dropped and rose a lot but the value in the stock, even when it’s fluctuating on a daily basis is still more valuable. so think about how much it can grow in a week. Especially because when you buy the value keeps going up we just need to do it on a large scale( and we are just wouldn’t mind more money going in because it means bigger returns for everyone) why do you think they call it running with the bulls. Gotta spend money to make money and the risk is always there but it’s less risky if the market is confident. The other option is trying to nickel and dime everyone to death by trying to sell for a tiny bit of money which might not work and then you could still just lose money.

luss8n|lbl62i|lbl62i|20|I'm afraid of downvotes and hate-filled-replies but I feel we need to discuss the culture here a bit...   Reddit always has this [sudden](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbh1kl/i_honestly_think_jim_cramer_was_right_when_he/) [clarity](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbj15v/please_control_your_risk_please_protect_your/) after a position has turned against them...and we act like we always knew the truth. But during the madness, dissenting opinions are so heavily mocked and downvoted that the entire sub becomes an echo chamber, and I expect that many users are unaware of their risks. It seems dangerous when you can't hear a single opposing thought -- even if the opposition is dead wrong. Even for my most prized investments and gambles, I welcome criticism. It makes me better evaluate my position. Maybe that's not for everyone?|2021-02-03 06:48:07

Something inside me said no just don’t do it it’s not over and look at you all go, you kept pushing... and pushing... and pushing!!! I’m now down £300, if I’d of been a pussy and cut my losses yesterday I’d of been worse off. PLEASE if you’re seeing this and you’re in a situation similar to me, HOLD.

People kept talking about how hard it could become to keep the "diamond hands", and obviously thats true, but the hardest part to me seems to be actually deciding when to just take your profits.  As a rookie it was awesome to see the numbers go up all the time, but I kept putting off collecting because I had the feeling I would miss out on something even greater. And eventhough I made some profits, it couldve been more if I had just listened to the voice in me.

lv0rf7|lbl62i|lbl62i|6|Automod keeps taking this down  &#x200B;  &#x200B;     [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wallstreetbets-reddit-bot-activity/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wallstreetbets-reddit-bot-activity/)  They imply that there was bot activity *in favor* of buying GME. I'm not saying that didn't happen, but our problem, especially on the GME specific thread, was certainly not people who like the stock. It was shills for SLV, people spreading FUD, and generally manipulative tactics to be blamed. The official WSB email apparently reached out to CBS. I could see every one of those quotes used being taken out of context and originally directed towards ACTUAL bots.  I know I was up all night on WSB, and the # of bots was outstanding. There was a Thanos snap every few seconds in the comment section when sorting by new. This was always anti-GME stuff from what I saw.  Also, keep in mind that the shills are advancing in their tactics. They started the day saying "buy silver". Real WSBers got annoyed and started to downvote those posts. Bots and shills then started saying things like "Don't buy silver buy GME". This sounds good UNTIL you realize that everyone was automatically downvoting anything that mentioned silver. This means some people would see a comment suggesting to buy GME instead of silver and that the comment would likely be downvoted by that point. This could lead someone to think "hmm..people seem to hate the idea of buying GME instead of silver". Later tactics involved people saying stuff like "I don't care if we're trending down and I'm going to lose all my $ as long as I'm a part of history" or something similar. This brand of comments became very popular during close. It was unnatural, all at once, and I looked into many of the accounts to confirm my suspicions. These comments are more difficult to immediately recognize as shill activity, because the nefarious effort is not as obvious. It was *NOT* normal behavior, though.  Even the front page seems to have some possible shills - Example  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8lwf/why\_the\_fuck\_are\_we\_acting\_like\_we\_lost\_we\_made/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8lwf/why_the_fuck_are_we_acting_like_we_lost_we_made/)  Nobody said we lost as the post implies. In fact, we are looking really good. Tomorrow we have short restrictions, possible GME announcement, continued good volumes, some $800 call whales, etc. Anyways, you get the idea that shills can be hard to detect.  I recognize that a lot of the behavior I mentioned is legitimate and that the poster I linked to may not be making an underhanded effort.  Anyways, what makes me the most mad is CBS mentioned that the SEC was stepping in on behalf of retail investor's interest in eliminating any illegal activity. CBS did not then mention any of the illegal activity we know to be going on at shitron, but they instead implied that we, in fact, are the target of the SEC.  This is B.S.  Buy. Hold. Diamond hands.

lukpwm|lbl62i|lbl62i|27| "[GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GME) shares gained 11% in premarket trade on Wednesday as the short squeeze fueled by retail traders on Reddit looks to revive itself following a steep decline.

luoamv|lbl62i|lbl62i|28|$AMC!!  Two reasons to buy shares today  1. Because of the short ladder attack yesterday, the stock fell more than 10% which means its listed in the SSR list ([https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/symdir/shorthalts/shorthalts20210203.txt](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/symdir/shorthalts/shorthalts20210203.txt)) meaning no one can short the stock today. It's an SEC rule 201. Hence, no market manipulation. 2. When buying, buy little amount of shares spread out, say for example 10 shares at 8.1, 10 shares at 8.11. Why? Because we like the stock. Yesterday, the HF bought 100 shares at 1 cent difference. This is literal volume manipulation.  Obligatory, I am not a financial advisor, but we are going to mooooon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀  &#x200B;  Edit: For people saying there's nothing such as short ladder [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/options-strategy-day-employing-short-put-ladder-rising-volatility-2010-06-24](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/options-strategy-day-employing-short-put-ladder-rising-volatility-2010-06-24) Article is from 2010|2021-02-03 05:54:39

lup86n|lbl62i|lbl62i|25|I haven't put on GME more than I can afford to loose, so worst case scenario for me is I hold the shares and wait until the value of the company rises over next however long, weeks, months, years, it's just parked money for me at the moment. I can loose it all and still eat, pay rent, cover all my overheads. I can hustle some extra work over the next weeks and months to make some of it back anyway. I didn't come this far to walk out now.   I'll even buy on the way down if it gets really low, so I can average out those losses in the years to come. So if Gamestop uses all this attention and momentum whatever, to grow its brand and value, I'm sure that given enough time I'll maybe break even.  This is an amazing ride and I don't regret a thing, again, I put in what I could afford to loose.  I've found confidence and a new sense of purpose along the way, learned a lot about all sorts of things, learned a lot about myself and my convictions, and for me, lessons like this are worth the 'loss' (I only loose if I sell). I'll happily pay the price.  Yes I'm $16k in, but you can best believe I'm going to use this experience to turn a profit in other areas of my life, I'll come out on top, one way or another.  I'm holding, I only loose if I sell.|2021-02-03 06:06:45

lumrg7|lbl62i|lbl62i|33|    Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 05:34:00

luwhrx|lbl62i|lbl62i|55|For everyone on the GME AMC train 🚆: here is how the Short Ladder attacks are executed.   You and your hedgefund friends are going to use your own stocks that you own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, you guys are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system cant recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore thinks the supply is high. Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesnt matter though, since you as someone who is holding isnt selling at that price. It doesnt MATTER what the price is if no one is selling.   See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its many different stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low.  Why is this important? Its important because the hedgefunds need to BUY your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy YOUR stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. And if they cant buy they cant close their shorts. If they cant close their shorts they'll have to pay interest. And when the interest becomes too much they are going to be FORCED to buy YOUR stocks at whatever price YOU offer. This is the squeeze  The squeeze starts when the hedgefunds cant afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. Theyll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells untill 1000usd they are going to be forced to pay that, if noone sells until 10000usd theyll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions en masse they will FLOOD the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling.   However if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isnt the actual price. Its a price thats tricked into the system.  This is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. if everyone holds there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesnt matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NOONE FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO BUY FROM so they cant close their positions, theyll have to keep paying interest, and at some point they will HAVE TO BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the PRICE.|2021-02-03 07:25:57

lup59j|lbl62i|lbl62i|17|This is for all retards who feel like these volatility down moves is making their stomach hurt, and whose friends and family are now hammering insults at them making their paper hands all wet and weak.  When your family and friends so expertly told you to sell at $400, ask them if they actually did that sell? they will probably tell you they didn't even invest in the first place, but they could all tell you that they would obviously have sold at the high.  Ignore those people and ask yourself, are you in this stock because you like the stock or what?  Do you want to see the short squeeze happen when you actually own some of the stock or are you in this thing to make a certain % of tendies, if you just want some gain in % then sell and get out when you have that and stop bothering the rest of us with your weak ass posts crying about the good old highs.  If the answer is you want to sell after the short squeeze then don't bother looking at the prices if you are not gonna add to your buy.  The answer to not feeling sick with these -% values that we are experiencing now is to not count your tendies before you order them.

lvc8m3|lbl62i|lbl62i|16|    Lock up those shares …..  Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 09:28:51

lwqap4|lbl62i|lbl62i|16|TLDR; Shoutout to FIDELITY for continuing to be awesome and providing EXCELLENT customer service. Doesn't matter that I am a 🐒 'tard, they still made be feel valued and heard. And reversed a broker fee and account transfer fee from Robinhood  I am a retard, I am not providing any financial advice, just sharing my own newbie experience.   Opened a Robinhood account and transferred $ in from my Chase the evening before Robinhood restricted trading and GME stocks. I got pissed enough to open a new account at Fidelity to try trading there. Bought 1 GME @ $323 last Friday right before close sticking to the short-bet HFs. Decided I wanted to try and buy another share at the lower dip price to have a better average holding my 2 GME stonks ✋💎💎🤚.......I also tried transferring my Robinhood account (like an idiot) over to Fidelity. Had not bought any stocks with Robinhood but my money was still tied up over there. Robinhood sent a $75 charge to Fidelity for the account transfer, but didnt actually transfer anything! Yesterday I was on Fidelity chat help and phone hold for a combo 2 hours but when I actually able to speak with a real human after waiting, they help reverse the $75 account transfer fee yesterday and today they helped me transfer to a broker who helped me buy one more GME @ $93. He told me about a $23 broker fee but seeing all the difficulty I had, he waived it and helped me confirm the purchase without any additional fee. I told him all the wonderful customer service I had received so far and told them to keep up the good work because they were gaining a lot of new customers based on comment like these.   Fuck YA Fidelity. And now I got my 2 GME Stonks @ avg $206. To the MOON ladies and gents|2021-02-03 15:05:12

We were in this together, we had couple of rough days, i know how the psychology works, i am in my last year of medicine. It will eat you up from inside when you see the numbers falling.  We all new from the beginning its all or nothing. So don't sell and hold. We win or we loose. We are in this together. At least we can say at the end we tried our best. Let these guys or bots say whatever they want, if we really stay together, we can win this.   For the heck of it if it doesn't work out, when the movie comes out, we can say we were the once who tried against the bully suits.  👍🏼🦍 AMC, GME  P.s not spamming, just trying to put all the negativity out!|2021-02-03 08:46:10

luxseu|lbl62i|lbl62i|19|3 stocks I believe in if anyone wants tips:     AMD Bull:   Good earnings. Now quite cheap because it oversold. Large possibility to climb in market cap.     AMD Bear: Intel had a new CEO change recently. They are still really far behind AMD, but maybe they can start turning it around now. Last CEO explicitly said that they can't keep up with competition anymore.     Think AMD will be 130-140 EoY   \---------------     PLTR   Bull, Earnings coming up 11/2, and for the first time I think they will have reached earnings. Years before they never reached because they were focusing on infrastructure and growth. Now it's soon time to make a profit, and over the course of years they will most likely increase steadily. They've built up a good foundation.  &#x200B;  Mom Cathie believes in it and has loaded up a lot for ARK, and she is one of the best investors alive atm.     Bear, Lock-up period finished soon + Citi marking it as a $15 stock. Bear short-term, but 100% Bull long term  PLTR 50-60 EoY  \----------------------  &#x200B;  FTCH,      Luxury retailer that is sort of a portal for different luxury shops to add their store so you can browse them all at the same time. It's not a single store like Matchesfashion or SSense so in that sense they are pretty alone in the market. No real competitiors.     Bull: Steadily climbing, almost monopoly. People have realized you can order luxury online now instead of going to stores because of Covid.  &#x200B;  Bear: Idk might have grown in market cap a bit too quick, might adjust a bit short term but will be good long term.     FTCH 100 EoY|2021-02-03 07:37:51

That’s what, $10 out of $2.5 initial investment? Being able to profit $470 from $10 initial investment for gme stock already looked like a scratcher lottery rather than squeeze. I assume smart people who had 100+ stocks of gme for the average below $30 just sold 90% of it for $300+ price and kept the rest to see if it will go even higher.

A lot of us watched our families be torn apart starting in ‘08 because of them and the failed embarrassment of occupy now we can actually take the only thing they give a fuck about which is their money. I think my generation see GameStop as a place where if they have some extra $ they put it in there long term to fuck with the elites and save.

lwozg0|lbl62i|lbl62i|18|Hi, the names Todd, Re Todd  The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are all meeting sometime during the week to discuss apps like Robinhood limiting stock purchases on GME and AMC!! This could be a huge win for everyone that has been working so hard to expose the fraudulent market that these greedy assholes have been manipulating. I wouldn’t get our hopes up just yet as obviously these apps are backed by not only the hedgefunds, but also google as we clearly saw with the review tampering. It could also go the good way, as what these apps have been doing violates the The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and hopefully the government will acknowledge this! Stay strong everyone, they literally can’t close their shorts unless you sell, so HOLD HOLD HOLD what you have! I still have 25 shares in AMC that I have had for going on three weeks, it’s not much but it’s all I can afford!! To the moon and beyond !! 🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-03 14:56:29

Honestly when I first heard about this I thought it could be a quick buck... But after reading through this, I don't care.  It's not about the money, if I lose all I put in its fine.  I believe this moment, this movement is going to be a catalyst for major changes in the future. I am happy and honored to be a part of it.

lup8u3|lbl62i|lbl62i|24|# If you feel anxious about $GME, get an alert app and disconnect for a while.  Paraphrasing Mark Cuban, "If you still believe in why you bought the stock, hold the stock"  These last few days have been exhausting mentally for many people in the community. If you plan on holding the stock, even if the price keeps dipping, just set an alert on a certain price and get some shit done. Do some work, study some, go to the gym or take a day off. If the alert hits you then come back. Setting yourself back mentally in this game will not help you! And we must support each other in relaxing a bit.  TL;DR Monkey staring at screen too much? Monkey feel bad? Monkey still hold? Download app that tell you when banana big and take monkey day off. Other monkey not going anywhere.  **Spread this please.**|2021-02-03 06:07:00

lupvzy|lbl62i|lbl62i|24|2020 was a wild ride. Don't we all know it?  It was an especially wild ride for me when I found out in december that I have multiple sclerosis in my brain and spine. To be fair, with the recent developments in treatment and symptom-management options it's not as bad a diagnosis as it was 10 years ago. I could be looking at early disability retirement in 10 years at age 40, or I could get lucky, and treatment could work and I could live a relatively normal life untill the life expectancy -10 mark. Anyways, this was a wake up call of sorts, to take life by the balls and live to the fullest until I can't do that anymore, sooner or later that's what I have to look forward to.  In comes January, and this shitstorm rolercoaster of a ride we may or may not be getting to the end of. And me, and absolute retard newbie trader decided "what the hell, fucking yolo" and bought sum shares at $150. I rode the ride and I was stoked to see it soar to $500 and I was hyped, and holding fast to the 1000+ line and I was going to make some money to help me through the treatments and the hard times ahead. But in comes Melvin with their dicks on their hands and their shitty manipulation tactics and it all came crashing down like my hopes and dreams when I heard that stupid fucking diagnosis for the first time.  It's been a hell of a ride, but it is with sorrow in my heart that I must say that I can no longer be with you in this fight and I must jump ship like a motherfucking paperhanded rat in a sinking stonks ship.  Except... FUCK THAT SHIT. I am not selling. Those suit wearing motherfucking slimes wont get my shares. I'm going to hold them even if it means I get to frame them and hang them on my wall just to say "Hey look nurse, I was there wen it went down and I didnt sell." at age 50 in a nursing home, because then she would strip down and jump on my motherfucking diamond hard dick and at the very least I'll still be getting some.  I probably have more reasons to sell right now than most of you, and I AIN'T. FUCKING. SELLING.  **BUY.**  **HOLD.**  💎💎🙌🙌🚀🚀  This is not financial advice and I am certified retarded with a doctor's note to prove it.|2021-02-03 06:14:50

If you sell, even just to buy back, they get to launder their dirty shares. DONT SELL UNTIL THIS IS OVER. End of Feb. at least.  Holding is our friend. Low volume is our friend (high volume masks their fraud shares) and in the end the brokers are who become the bag holders. The DTCC under-reports their FtDs to the SEC who looks the other way.

I lost my job due to covid and have effectively been homeless and jobless since August. I had little money to support the cause but I bought what I could with what I have left. I just want to say that you guys are amazing and I’m happy that I was able to help at all. Watching the dips, knowing these insane surges are coming after gets me through the day.

lvjf7b|lbl62i|lbl62i|17|Yes, the stocks look similar. You haven't discovered some giant conspiracy. Yes, I believe the hedges are colluding with many rich and powerful people and agencies in an effort to keep our publicly favored stocks down. But to say that because the graphs look sort of similar then obviously they're manipulating the market only serves to show how inexperienced you are with the stock market. These things happen. Especially regarding ones like GME and AMC. Of course they're moving together. Melvin capital and citron and all their buddies are launching attack after attack on them in a coordinated fashion, and their rise and fall is pretty intertwined because of their almost cult like following on here.

But guess what ITS NOT A LOSS UNTIL YOU SELL. If you want to sell and walk away with -10,000 in your account and -1 wife then go ahead 🌈🐻 count your losses and go home. But this is what the hedge funds want. REMEMBER WHY WE’RE HERE! They shorted billions of dollars from company’s and made thousands of people almost lose there jobs, and for YEARS nobody could stop them! Now that we’re finally making them lose billions of dollars you think that they’re just going to take the L and walk away? F*** NO! They’re going to fight by MANIPULATING THE MARKET! Making the media scare us! By promoting silver! Using short ladder attacks! And by not even letting us purchase $GME shares. I know you’ve lost a lot of money, but this is a war between us and them.

His only advice for next time was to  make sure we weren't caught in underfunded brokers again!  Stop  asking how many shares Robinhood, or any other shitty broker, is now  allowing you to purchase! IT DOES NOT MATTER. If this moons, that number  will once again be zero.  Copy/Paste plzz|2021-02-03 12:46:27

lwl5wc|lbl62i|lbl62i|4|Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing social media posts for signs of potential fraud behind the recent trade frenzy in shares of GameStop Corp (GME) and other companies, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.  The scrutiny is being done in tandem with a review of trading data to assess whether such posts were part of a manipulative effort to drive up share prices, the report said.

lvghsr|lbl62i|lbl62i|32|PLEASE UPVOTE: EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS:  HOLDING ALONE IS NOT GOING TO WORK. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER ONCE MORE  I’m sure many of you (along with myself) were thinking about $ROPE last night after seeing our portfolios take such a hit. BUT, we still have a chance. And BILLIONAIRE Mark Cuban showed us how and everyone missed it. The only reason the stonk gained any traction is because everyone bought in together. We did this as a TEAM and made shockwaves. We changed the game. The power of the retail investor banding together made a stonk hit an unbelievable high.  Holding alone is not going to work this time. We need to come together again and invest in the stock we LIKE… AGAIN.  How you may ask? FINDING A NEW broker. If you’re stuck on RH, leave you RH account and open another one with you bank or WeBull or Fidelity or whatever it is in your country. Make the move and we can do this together… TODAY. Regardless of whether or not the squeeze has already occurred, Cuban explicitly stated that he thinks funds and big players have shorted the stock AGAIN because they think they are smarter than all of us.  The world thinks we are autistic after yesterday’s bloodbath. We NEED to come together again and show the world how autistic we really are!  There are 8 million subs on here. Whether you’re in the RED or GREEN or have sold, investing another $100 into a stonk you like is not going to break you anymore than it already has. BUT it will make a HUGE difference if we do it TOGETHER. $100 x 8million subs.. WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE.  USA, Canada, Europe, Asia, Antartica, whatever, we need to COME TOGETHER ONCE MORE. TODAY IS THE DAY.  We did this once, we can do it again. This the ENDGAME folks, how are you going to go out? Are you going to stand up and fight or just lay down and die.  /WSB RETARDS….

There’s also the fact that I have zero experience in the market, and all my knowledge has come from WSB. If you’re like me, and aren’t bothered about the money, then fuck it, hold that shit. but if you have put more money in than you can afford, take a step back, and reassess the situation.

I really don't understand how people lose money and are ready to jump ship, this shit takes time. Unless you have thousands or millions to invest, your not gonna make real money real fast.  You don't sit at a $5 poker table and expect to win millions, same shit. Even as a newbie I know you take chances and you win or lose.   I learned alot and still have some things to learn. I have no clue what an option is. Just learned about ladfering and short selling. No clue what a call or a put is.  I put a few hundred in, buy the stock and wait. If I lose then so be it, it's better than saying what if. And if I lose money, I've gained more knowledge for the next time. So I still win in the long run|2021-02-03 14:35:53

lup5ub|lbl62i|lbl62i|23| If you feel anxious about $GME, get an alert app and disconnect for a while.  Paraphrasing Mark Cuban, "If you still believe in why you bought the stock, hold the stock"  These last few days have been exhausting mentally for many people in the community. If you plan on holding the stock, even if the price keeps dipping, just set an alert on a certain price and get some shit done. Do some work, study some, go to the gym or take a day off. If the alert hits you then come back. Setting yourself back mentally in this game will not help you! And we must support each other in relaxing a bit.  TL;DR Monkey staring at screen too much? Monkey feel bad? Monkey still hold? Download app that tell you when banana big and take monkey day off. Other monkey not going anywhere.  **Spread this please.**|2021-02-03 06:05:57

luxgzx|lbl62i|lbl62i|24|The year is 2025. You're driving home in your new tesla that you bought from selling your $GME.  It's dark out but your wife's boyfriend needed more lube.  You stop the car because there's something crawling out into the middle of the road. "It's them", you think to yourself. The dark figure starts running towards you. He tackles you. He's on top of you now; you're trying to get away. He mumbles deeply into your ear "paper handed bitch". He starts punching you in the gut. "DIAMOND HANDS, DIAMOND HANDS", he says with each blow.  Suddenly he stops and looks up into the sky, he sees the moon. "It must be a sign". He runs off on all fours as he chants "The squeeze is coming, its a sign". You were lucky this time. Next time you might not be. You consider stopping at the TslaMart and picking up the new bag-holder-boulder3000 to defend yourself.  Its a rock in the shape of a Gabe Plotkin.|2021-02-03 07:34:59

luz4k3|lbl62i|lbl62i|19|Short Seller Restrictions for today include GME, AMC, BB, and more. Tried to post this on its own but is getting removed for some reason.  It seems that people are still confused about where to find information regarding the SSR list for the day, so I will post a link below to the Excel file for your viewing. These are all companies that were shorted more than 10% yesterday and tripped the SSR. I've already explained how that works multiple times as have others, but essentially it means that shorter's can no longer sell into the bid to aggressively drive down the price. They can only sell on the ask side of the book which makes it much more difficult to drive down the price. This takes effect immediately when the SSR is tripped and is in effect for the remainder of that trading day and the following trading day, assuming the following trading day it does not fall 10% or more again during intraday. It is still however fairly easy to suppress the price until the SSR is lifted and they can continue shorting it again. This is why so many of these stocks yesterday were driven down in price very quickly, and then flatlined for the remainder of the day mostly. We know this to be true because we can see them doing it in the order book.  It seems people looking for this list have been trying to find it via the NASDAQ website which for some reason is one of the first search results, but you need to be pulling this from the FTP server on the NYSE website.   ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210202.xls  TLDR; I would expect continued price suppression on the stocks today, but we will not see the same aggressive shorting into the bid side of the book like we did yesterday. Provided that a stock on this list does not fall 10% again today, the SSR will expire and aggressive shorting can resume tomorrow.|2021-02-03 07:49:48

I was disappointed, past night I was wondering if everything was over, did I join the fight too late? So this morning, I doubled down and took even more out of my saving to buy Gamestop!

I'm holding 1000 AMC at the moment and if it doesnt pay off in the short game they will be good long positions. BB and NOK are bandwagon hype. just watching GME, i'm genuinely interested to see what happens here. despite all the superfluous chatter the core seems to be holding pretty well, and that will cause problems for the people trying to topple it, how much I don't know. you people should not be risking your lives on this though. this is about making money, not a movement.

Please DO NOT spend another second of your life doing business with a shit bag interactive broker like RH, who has restricted how you may spend your own money -- by limiting $GME, $AMC et al. They have shown they just want to protect their own interests and are driving down the stock.  If this pertains to you, then grab your under-developed balls, display some intestinal fortitude, and transfer all of your current positions/money IMMEDIATELY out of RH to another broker without limits -- and then BUY more $GME.  I cannot speak for the other sites, but I've had zero issues buying $GME with E\*TRADE. Used them since 2010, out of the military. ET definitely has their ups and downs. But I have never had limitations with buying $GME. Do your research and find an alternative that works.  **Let's all execute Phase 2 of Operation Hedge Funder Butt Fuck!

lv183o|lbl62i|lbl62i|10|This blurb from Bloomberg needs to be circulated.  This is the real reason why we hold apes.  I think what's under reported so far is that institutional investors own 113,664,181 shares of gamestop right now. That's 162.97% of the 71 million that actually exist. -source: https://fintel.io/so/us/gme  https://fintel.io/so/us/gme Individual investors likely hold between 10-40 million shares. It's difficult to gauge, but these numbers are based on the Wall Street Bets Forum membership of 2 million, where each member owns between 5-20 shares. These numbers are extremely conservative. Most members prefer higher risk/higher reward and possibly have the entirety of the actual outstanding GME shares and more. Furthermore, the forum has now grown to 8 million subscribers, most eager to be a part of what they see as the greatest opportunity to win playing the same game as the hedge funds for the first time. (And maybe last)  Shares currently held by investors (not short sellers): Low - 123 million or 173% Mid - 153 million or 215% High - 184 million 259%  These particular investors aren't in any hurry and understand the consequences of their investment strategy and that of the short sellers. The shorts massively overreached and will eventually need to repay their borrowed shares.  Does it look likely they'll be able to do that if the total number of investors is more than 200%?  $GME is a time bomb and it's highlighting a severe vulnerability in the financial system.|2021-02-03 08:07:35

WSB is not some organized entity, but rather a place where hype is generated or tempered by really good DD.  It is also a place where conversation can run free and trigger something far, far greater as people pile in on it out of fear of missing out.  Do not reduce us to some random guy in a bar shouting that we need to organise.   WSB will not organise, it never has, that is the beauty of this place.

lvbdbj|lbl62i|lbl62i|9|I would also like to add for the new guys.  If you haven't been to the casino and won/lost big, know that the dopamine effect is VERY REAL.  When your stock is mooning, you will lose your mind and make poor choices.  From what I've read, many of you are poor or low income.  If you're up big, lock it in, and step away from trading for at least that day.  I prefer 3-5 days to cool off to clear my mind.  And no, jerking off your little PP and busting a nut in 30s isn't going to give you the clarity you're going to need to make the right decision.  Yes, I'm still in GME, and yes, I've made these mistakes I'm warning you about, but if you never learn from your mistakes, you will never make it to the top.

This is why I hold;  Reposting from bloomberg: institutional investors own 113,664,181 shares of gamestop right now. That's 162.97% of the 71 million that actually exist. -source: https://fintel.io/so/us/gme  https://fintel.io/so/us/gme Individual investors likely hold between 10-40 million shares. It's difficult to gauge, but these numbers are based on the Wall Street Bets Forum membership of 2 million, where each member owns between 5-20 shares. These numbers are extremely conservative. Most members prefer higher risk/higher reward and possibly have the entirety of the actual outstanding GME shares and more. Furthermore, the forum has now grown to 8 million subscribers, most eager to be a part of what they see as the greatest opportunity to win playing the same game as the hedge funds for the first time. (And maybe last)  Shares currently held by investors (not short sellers): Low - 123 million or 173% Mid - 153 million or 215% High - 184 million 259%  These particular investors aren't in any hurry and understand the consequences of their investment strategy and that of the short sellers. The shorts massively overreached and will eventually need to repay their borrowed shares.  Does it look likely they'll be able to do that if the total number of investors is more than 200%?|2021-02-03 14:44:23

lvmqbj|lbl62i|lbl62i|16|TLDR: (at the end)   I’m calling this: The Horizon   I’ve heard nobody theorize this which is why I thought I would write out my thoughts and see what you guys think. An interesting theory was proposed to me by a friend that this could be a possible acquisition play by a big player in a similar niche or even the larger retail industry. I disagreed at first but when I thought about it, it seems like it could actually occur because that’s exactly what Porsche did to VW during the 08 VW squeeze.   1) Massive retailer sees this not only as a buying opportunity but also as a profitable opportunity. (Porsche purchased the majority of VW’s floating shares in order to give themselves voting control in VW board after riding the squeeze and profited 10 Billies at the same time)   2) They also hate manipulative short sellers because they’ve been shorting their own brick and mortar retail company for years. (made sure to put manipulative in here as normal short sellers are actually good for the health of the stock market). The retailer sees this is a profitable opportunity to take over the company and its assets, as well as burn the manipulative short sellers.   3) The $100 million in calls purchased Monday (02/01) were curious to me. It was theorized that HF’s were covering themselves in case the price of the stock rallied, but with the new theories here that melvin and others actually escaped their short positions and now sit on profitable $400-$450 shorts, it wouldn’t make sense for them to buy such a substantial amount of calls to hedge themselves.   4) This makes me think there is a big player that could help squeeze the stock in the next few days or potentially weeks, for their interest alone. (Potentially Amazon or Walmart)  5) They buy a massive amount of calls and floating shares, squeeze the stock, burn the short sellers, make a massive amount of profit on the call premiums, wait for GME to tumble back down and use possibly just use their call profits to outright purchase over 50% of the float and therefore own GME and their board.   It would be a genius play. They would acquire GME for pennies on the dollar, possibly with money they received from call premiums and liquidating their early float investment, they acquire a massively covered company that is now even MORE of a household name due to this short squeeze all over the news and the world, the new retailer has 6,000+ new retail locations they can revamp into their own company or simply let Cohen build the company as he planned and reap the profits from that, and they get to shove a nice phat banana up Melvins bunghole with their freshly polished diamond hands.   Arguments against:  Why would any company risk a possible massive loss by purchasing $100 million in calls on GME? - Walmart profited $129.35 billion dollars in 2020. So purchasing calls for that much would not be 1% of their profit, not even .01% of their profit. With the possible returns of 6,000+ new stores, it seems probable they would make this play.  The $100 million in calls were purchased by HF’s you idiot - if this is the case, then the theory that melvin and others have covered their shorts already is highly improbable, because they would not need to hedge their bets against a short squeeze, as the squeeze would not happen anymore. Either they did not cover and are hedging their bets, or they did cover and someone else is playing the other side to force a squeeze, OR they didn’t cover AND someone on the other side is planning to force a squeeze.  Why wouldn’t they purchase GameStop right now? They have plenty of money to do so? - There are not enough shares. They NEED the squeeze, because all of those shares are still “held” by the HF’s shorting the company. The only way for (walmart) to purchase the company and 51% of it’s float is to force a squeeze so the shares become available on the market. They have no other choice.    And that is The Horizon   I am not a financial advisor, I just like monkeys and phat bags of bananas.   TLDR: A massive retailer is forcing the short squeeze so they can free up 51% of float and purchase GME.|2021-02-03 10:41:00

I’d do it myself but I’m too green here and am just a hardcore lurker, so I don’t want anyone to call the thread into question is all.  I just had a semi positive article about GME disappear from the related news section under the stock price on Apple Stocks. Really old negative articles are being edited and reposted constantly. Articles are still talking about silver being “hot on WSB”...  Even IF the squeeze was squoze, which I don’t think it has been and I’m still holding, why are the media being so shady?  A thread on the front page to call out all the reporters would be hilarious and newsworthy tbh...  I’m not a financial advisor or a subreddit advisor, I just think it’d be entertaining to call them out and watch them squirm...  EDIT: Also, we all should just be screenshotting this stuff anyway. Screen recording ALL of our trades. We need as much evidence as possible if they pull any more fuck shit and we end up fighting back in the courts.

lvdcbu|lbl62i|lbl62i|22|https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/  Starting with that because they can help you more than I ever could if you feel in need.  No one is coming to help you. The money is gone.  I empathize deeply. I've owed a broker a million dollars overnight. I've lost tens of thousands on a forced margin liquidation. I've lost thousands when a brokerage goes down and I can't sell.  Right now there's still some group adrenaline that "we'll get them". It will fade as reality sets in.  You are or may feel a unique shame. Trading does that because there's a strong undertone of "you knew the risk" and "free market".  If you traded on margin you're feeling confused. It was so easy to do and now the losses may feel incomprehensible. It is confusing and you're not stupid.  It is unlikely that any crime was committed against you. If one was those responsible may face jail or fines paid to the government. You will not be repaid.  There may be a class action lawsuit. If by some remote chance you are part of a class with demonstrable damages and win, you will get cents on the dollar and it will take years.  These politicians are not going to help you. When most of them say why can institutions do this but not regular people they mean they want to regulate institutions, not help you.  Because of the publicity of all this congress will hold its hearings and people will be dressed down. But you will not be repaid.  My DMs are open and I will try to be as helpful as I can. Or just to listen.  If you have a question about a situation you're in with a trade, margin, etc it's probably best to post it here and let everyone help.  Take care of one another and yourself. You will make it through to the other side if you rely on others to help.|2021-02-03 09:36:37

All the viewpoints against GME are just being downvoted to oblivion, or are being replied to with memes or arguments that tbh feel like recycled info other newcomers heard from someone else. And the veteran traders/wsb ppl are just calling the newcomers idiots in response.

luskr4|lbl62i|lbl62i|8|**PSA for QQQJ** ---------------------------------------------------------  If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**.   It is attractive because: 1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials. 2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ. 3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap.  ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums. 4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually.   I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of March once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 before end of February!   Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.   Have a nice day and make a lot of tendies today!|2021-02-03 06:45:53

luwjjb|lbl62i|lbl62i|7|CNBC’s “objective journalism”: “Other Reddit trades have also come back down to Earth amid trading restrictions from major brokers.”  Since when jurnos determine the “fair value” of a stock (e.g. come back down to Earth)? Is $100 “down to earth”? Or how about $20? Then what is “oversold”, “manipulation”, “speculation”? Does CNBC have certain values for those as well? Perhaps the hedgies came back down to earth and realized that ruining a company just because you decided to might backfire big time?

You may not be able to buy food.  Your utilities may be shut off and an eviction notice may be placed on your door, but the important thing to remember is that you haven't lost any money.|2021-02-03 13:44:00

Darth Melvin was the Dark Lord of Hedge Funds, so powerful and so corrupt he could use Robinhood and the Media to manipulate the market… He had such a knowledge of the dark side of Wall Street that he could even keep the investors he cared about from bankruptcy. The dark side of Wall Street is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only things he was afraid of was losing his power and money, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice WSB everything he knew, then his apprentice bankrupt him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from bankruptcy, but not himself.|2021-02-03 15:26:48

If you can afford it, buy the dip. Suits are swapping shares they have with one another to manipulate the price of the stock. That way it will dip and they think they’ll make us pussy out and sell so they can get out of their shorts. Eventually interest will get too high and if we’re still holding they HAVE to pay what WE want. And that’s how we reach the moon. Idk who needed to hear this, but everything is going according to plan. Tell yourself, tell your friends, HOLD YOUR SHARES. BUY MORE IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO. THIS IS HOW WE WIN.|2021-02-03 07:57:43

lux8xv|lbl62i|lbl62i|22|    Lock up those stocks …..  Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 07:32:55

We have multiple people buying weather its wise or not theyre buying and the price is still immediately falling after A spike. I know you guys are trying to give  up on this but the truth is that the spike that was created within the first few days of GME AND AMC both can happen again if we can orchestrate it. People are spending too much time bouncing around to different stocks. Panic selling and rebuying. We need to orchestrate something and then we will have results. Ever since the 6+ Mil joined everything has been very off the the walls and there is no guidance. We need to get things inline and time an all around buy its not that hard.

The move comes after the hedge fund provided $750 million in emergency cash to Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital, which was struggling with GameStop Corp. and other short bets gone sour. Citadel’s hedge funds, along with founder Ken Griffin and his firm’s partners, put $2 billion into Melvin."  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steve-cohen-point72-raises-1-183732615.html|2021-02-03 05:48:04

luky5d|lbl62i|lbl62i|13|What has been happening with the GME stock is pretty illegal, and honestly as long as there is no threat it will continue being so.   I recognise that it is not a useful or genuinely helpful attack but why don’t we start a petition to investigate into the corruption? Someone with as much understanding as possible of what has happened needs to create a petition and then all of us need to spread it on the accounts that we have on other sites so that regular people can see what’s going on.   I just can’t comprehend that we are all individually aware of corruption and illegal activity and we all are accepting what’s going on. We need to fight it, not for any moral reasoning but simply for our money.   If we want the squeeze to happen, and for us to get what we deserve we need to fight tooth and nail even outside of the stock market. They are using the media against us so we need to spread the truth.|2021-02-03 05:08:14

lulidd|lbl62i|lbl62i|23|The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack - why GME's real price is $2,147,483,737  **Hey diamond hands**,   as I am sure you have heard, there are rumors that short ladder attacks are being used to suppress the price of GME. While I held this belief for many days, I am now beginning to realize that even more insidious and backhanded techniques are being used against us. I mean seriously, there is simply no reasonable explanation for why a stock should drop in price. None.  The good news is that Melvin is more scared than ever. The bad news is that today was no short ladder attack. No, it was far worse.  **Today we experienced a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack**  Most people here have at least a few days of investing experience under their belts, so I'm not going to dumb down these concepts for you. If you can understand a short ladder attack, you can understand this tactic as well.  Basically, a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack (or Overflow attack for short) is the opposite of a short ladder attack. In a short ladder attack, shares are traded back and forth, with each trade a penny lower. In an overflow attack, the attack chooses to instead trade shares to an accomplice at incredibly high prices. How high you ask?  **$2,147,483,648**  That's right, hedge funds have been selling single shares for billions of dollars right behind our backs. Why this price though? It's simple.  Every investment app, RH, TD, etc, use 32 bit integers to store prices. The maximum value of a 32 bit integer is 2,147,483,647. So what happens when it goes up by one? It goes negative.   **This means that every share in an overflow attack is worth:  -$2,147,483,647**   What do you think this does to the price of a stock? If you answered bad things, you are correct. The sale of one of these shares is enough to send the price of a stock far into the negatives. Didn't think that stocks could go negative? I'm not surprised - that's another hedge fund secret. They don't tell you THAT on investopedia!  But as the critical thinkers you are, I'm sure you will now ask:  "Why isn't the stock price negative right now?"  The answer is because the squeeze is happening **RIGHT NOW**. Paper hands laughed at the idea of an infinity squeeze, but it happened and it was big. So big in fact that it overflowed the price itself.   **MATH TIME**  So we know that GME overflowed in the squeeze. But by how much? Well we know that the price right now is $90. But we have to take the overflow squeeze into consideration.   If there is -$2,147,483,557 of pressure on prices, then to reach $90 the stock must cost 2,147,483,647 + 90, or $2,147,483,737. Yes.  **EACH SHARE OF GME IS CURRENTLY WORTH $2,147,483,737**  We can't forget about overflow however, so the price stored in your brokerage account is actually -$1,073,741,734. Now this might sounds like a scary number, but as long as you didn't buy on margin you will be fine. As long as you keep holding, the SEC will be FORCED to do something about it. They are already under extreme pressure to help retail investors - it's only a matter of time.  And as a side note: If for some reason Melvin stops this overflow attack, your stocks will be worth over a billion negative dollars. At this point, buying GME makes a profit whereas selling puts the next 10 generations of you family into debt enslavement. So as the wise investors on WSB say: BUY!  **WE DESERVE OUR BILLIONS**   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;     ^^^^This ^^^^is ^^^^a ^^^^joke ^^^^not ^^^^financial ^^^^advice ^^^^I ^^^^swear ^^^^to ^^^^god ^^^^please ^^^^don't ^^^^let ^^^^the ^^^^SEC ^^^^take ^^^^me ^^^^away|2021-02-03 05:16:24

Now they just released a new spinal cord repair mesh that hopefully will cause someone with a broken spine to regain partial or full feeling as long as it is installed within a week.  Vids are jumping up on YouTube about it.  Someone keeps dropping the price as limits placed are well below at 50k + shares to buy, then 100k shares to sell.  This should be going off the charts.

lwelbw|lbl62i|lbl62i|12|Hold Monkes! Math is on your side and the price does not matter.  Let me explain: The stock price shows the current trading price but NOT the volume traded. If only two stocks change hands at 30 cents, then the price is shown at 30 cents.   But the company is still shorted over 100% so at some point the hedgefunds are FORCED to buy 100% of stock including yours. At that point the sales volume will drive the price right up until every last share was sold.  Just hold and be patient. Its math :-)  This is not advice by the way, I know nothing and am just a rambling idiot on the internet. Only risk what you can lose and cover your principal as soon as you can.  Bonus motivation: You will DEFINATLEY have a small role in the upcoming Hollywood BLOCKBUSTER Sequel to the Big Short - Big Squeeze" ..

lvho2c|lbl62i|lbl62i|10|Exited GME down about $50,000....  This was hard earned money, and not play money from these crazy gambles...    Doubled down on my bet and moved it all to AMC because at least they have a high probability of going back to $20.00+ when COVID restrictions are lifted....  Hopefully I didn't just piss away hundreds of thousands of dollars as I had 512 shares....  But only time will tell, and if I can manage to get my account value back to where it was before I played this crazy game, then I'm happy....  All in all, I still see GME as a good play with the volatility and the amount of attention this has gotten.  I do believe that once the trading restrictions are lifted in full, that this will fly again, but with a child on the way... and a wife to look out for, I can't continue to gamble my life savings in good conscience.  To those of you who are winning/won, I congratulate you....  To those playing a risky game like myself, know what you're getting in to....  By no means am I upset with my decision... rather, I know that I gambled and didn't hit where I wanted....  Someone likened my play to picking a random number at a roulette table, and that's exactly what I did.  I was trying to hit that 35:1 payout and I'm glad to exit with losses vs. losing everything.   MORE POWER TO THE PLAYERS, and I hope to see you all win where I lost....  On a side note, let's run AMC back up if y'all gorillas are still here and want to take the fight back up a notch!

lupmps|lbl62i|lbl62i|27|Credit - Johnny Apple Jr.  Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!  Wrong.  No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:  PRICE DOESN'T MATTER  WHAT?!  You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.  They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a "30 cent stock" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem. It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.  All the activity driving down the listed share price are illegal ladder attacks (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs. We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.  I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:  PRICE DOESN'T MATTER  So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:  # of Shares - Price  x 20 - $0.30c  x 80 - $5  x 400 - $20  x 600 - $40  x 900 - $60  x 2,000 - $100  x 5,000 - $150  x 10,000 - $200  x 30,000 - $300  x 50,000 - $400  x 150,000 - $500  x 1 mil - $1,000  x 15 mil - $5,000  x 30 mil - $69,420  Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.  Get it?  PRICE DOESN'T MATTER  They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.  This isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.|2021-02-03 06:11:41

luwjgl|lbl62i|lbl62i|5|If I have to compare weed stocks as a sector right now, I'd compare it to the EV/battery stocks back in November.  Battery/charging stocks like BLNK/PLUG were in a continuous cycle of breakouts followed by consolidation continuously until they just exploded into the stratosphere.  We could be in for a similar cycle out of weed stocks.  All of them look like they're in the mid-stage of a similar cycle.  I feel like some of these names can easily run another 100-200% the next few months as votes in Congress arrive.  The charts look identical and set for a stage of continuous cycles of breakout -> consolidation -> breakout.  I can't mention specifics because some are <$1bn market cap, but looks like everything will run.|2021-02-03 07:26:23

STILL ILLEGAL ASF BUT WON'T CRASH THE MARKET.**  **THIS IS THE HEDGE FUNDS FAULT. THEIR GREED AND SYSTEMIC CHEATING LED TO  THIS STALEMATE. WE ARE THROWING THE MONEY CHANGERS OUT OF THE TEMPLE IF  THAT INCLUDES BURNING THE TEMPLE DOWN IN THE PROCESS. WE ARE NOT  ECONOMIC TERRORIST BUT NORMAL PEOPLE WHO ARE TIRED OF THE BOOT OF THESE  COMPANIES ON OUR NECKS AND THE ONE'S CHARGED WITH REGULATING THEIR  ACTIONS, FAILURE TO DO SO OVER DECADES.**  **WE ARE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW..

lvl7r0|lbl62i|lbl62i|17|   **WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS NOT A SELL OFF, THIS IS PART OF THE STRATEGY**  Melvin Capital will throw lots of devious tricks like short selling at us to make it look the stock is falling. Don't fall for it.  Do not sell if you see any of the following:  1. The stock drops by 50% in a day. This is just hedgies pushing it down using ladder attacks to make it look like the squeeze is over. 2. SEC reports show that the shorts have covered their positions. This is misinformation spread by Wall Street. 3. GME drops down to $1 share 4. GME declares bankruptcy 5. GME is delisted by the NY Stock Exchange Commission 6.

lvw7k3|lbl62i|lbl62i|11|You should be buying AMC and selling out of the money calls with short expiration if you believe in long-term of stock.   Options are extremely expensive in these names and you would be effective lowering your costs bases a great deal. Buy 1,000 shares of AMC for 8.71 now = $8,710Sell 10 calls for Feb 12 strike 12 for .94 = $940.This takes the cost basis of your position to 7,770 or $7.71 a share  If stock breaks 12 on Feb 12, you sell 1,000 shares for 12 to cover your call and pocket $4,230 of profit, a cool $54% in two weeks. If AMC remains below 12, no sweat, you believe in the name long-term because movies are American pastime, etc.  Sell another 10 calls out of the money make another $1,000 to take your cost position down another $1 per share.  Rinse and repeat every two weeks until the implied volatility of the stock comes down...  You can to this with GME, but you would buy 100 shares and sell 1 call.|2021-02-03 11:44:25

luqndb|lbl62i|lbl62i|68|Short Ladder Attacks are not a thing. This has been explained on many posts but people keep bringing it up. This is literally a term invented here just for confirmation bias. There is no short ladder attack, it's not a thing that exists. The only websites that discuss them are made by angry bagholders literally yesterday.  Also while I'm here, DFV is "still in" if "still in" means "cashed out $13,000,000". He's fine no matter what happens.  And Mark Cuban was smart enough to never buy a single share. If he really thought you were all going to make millions when it shoots back up- don't you think he would've bought a few GME shares yesterday?  Seeing front page posts that say "the price of gamestock shares doesn't matter" is insane and should be called out at such. Thousands of people got convinced on here to dump huge sums into a bubble which has now burst. Someone writing 1000 words to explain why stock price actually doesn't matter is the kind of thing the SEC should be looking for: Predators trying to convince new investors to part with their cash on what is increasingly obvious to be a scam.  I won't even mention the front page posts that speak of a gigantic conspiracy involving the CIA, the deep state, wall street, the media etc etc. Maybe instead of a massive conspiracy...you just spent $350 on fucking GAMESTOP shares??? If you want a conspiracy, try looking at everyone in here who knew the bubble would burst but kept encouraging others to invest, just so they can get out with a profit.  There was frantic period from Thu-Mon that was absolutely Qanon tier. Anything that was even slightly negative about GME or WSB was attacked harshly on here. Anything that disagreed with GME going to $1000 a share was fake news. So many people tried to tell you that the shortsellers got out- but nobody here wanted to listen. [Remember this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xsfa/cool_but_why_would_they_bother_telling_us/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_gluiays) **Well it was 100% correct**. The shorts got out. This was reported in the media and if you had sold on that knowledge you'd be doing fine right now. But everything that didn't agree with your world view was FAKE NEWS.  If you are scrolling this daily thread wondering if you should buy shares in GME, consider this the sign you were looking for that you should not. Also have a think about who would be wanting to downvote this information so you can't read it. GME has dropped by 81% in the last four days. There are lots of people on here who have lost out BIG TIME, and they are desperate for a load of idiots to jump into the market, drag the share price up, so they can sell off and leave you holding the bag. There's literally thousands of shares you could invest in- why the fuck would you choose this one??|2021-02-03 06:23:51

Who's gonna do it? You? You, Private Paper Hands? I have a greater responsibility than you can *possibly* fathom. You weep for financial losses, and you curse the Diamond handed. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know -- that the temporary decline in GME, while tragic, probably saved lives; and my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. I am a true Diamond Handed Ape and completely unqualified to offer financial advice. I just like the stock.  You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that stock-- you *need* me on that stock.  We use words like "Ape," "tard," "autist." We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punch line.  Diamonds have neither the time nor the inclination to explain ourselves to infiltrators who rise and sleep under the blanket of the very freedom that we provide and then question the manner in which we provide it.  I would rather that you just said "thank you" and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you hold and stand the post simply because you like the stock.

Learning trends and patterns...figuring out this is a slower process than originally anticipated.  It would have been nice to be on the GME train early and sell late, but I'm glad I didn't.  Would have really slowed my learning and increased my addictiveness.  Thank you WSB for everything you do.  Some people will jump in and get burned.  Buy low...sell high...or hold the ones that have potential.  Holding AMC until theatres open back up.  Holding Nokia until the moon base is built.

lw2mfn|lbl62i|lbl62i|6|I discovered, well lead to the discovery of, a dead body at my local AMC once. No one got murdered or anything, the old projectionist just bit the dust while showing Meet the Spartans. Even the attendants didn't want to step foot in that theater so no one noticed that the movie had been over for days.  That's where I stepped in. Ready to be entertained by the brilliant comedic minds of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer I went to see it, but spent over an hour waiting for the film to start, they usually have trailers for the latest Adam Sandler hits coming out, I thought.  Frustrated that I couldn't see the parody of 300, another one of my favorite movies, I stomped down to the front desk and said I've been waiting forever and the movie hasn't started. Thinking the projectionist had just passed out drunk again, they went to splash some cold water on his face and wake him up for long enough to play the movie for me.  Well they went to wake him up, and as expected he was sprawled on the ground with a spilled bottle of Evan Williams spilled next to him. When they discovered he wasn't breathing it was a big ordeal with paramedics and all that. They gave me a coupon for half priced nachos and one free ticket to Disaster Movie, the next in Friedberg and Seltzer's enviable portfolio.|2021-02-03 12:25:38

lvhuhd|lbl62i|lbl62i|8|So apparently the NSCC (supposedly regulated by the SEC), the clearing corporation that is a subsidiary of the DTCC, owned by a consortium of private entities, mainly banks and brokers, got to arbitrarily set the collateral requirements for the net trades of highly volatile equities (like DME) coming from the very brokers that have a stake in Melvin Capital, after investing $2.75 billion on Monday, forcing those brokers to temporarily suspend ONLY purchases of certain securities.  You guys just need to look at the leadership and board of directors of the DTCC to quickly realize that these people are all closely connected and have deeply entrenched relationships to the Wall Street hedge fund mafia. Facebook and LinkedIn really help that purpose. The CFO of DTCC is married to an executive director at Morgan Stanley, who is also friends with Fund Managers X and Y, who are friends with a Broker's managing director, who is invested in Hedge Fund X, many of which have a house in the Hamptons. This is not a conspiracy theory, this is the reality of the finance-centric world we live in, these are facts.  Also, in a recent public interview with Elon Musk, Robinhood's CEO Vlad Tenev, admitted to have temporarily blocked DME purchases not only to comply with NSCC  requirements but also  to "protect" his customers!!!!! He literally said "also.. you know.. we knew this was a bad outcome for customers".  Interview link (min 12:00): https://youtu.be/gK4vDAcJ5-o?t=717  Vlad also said that he "doesn't really know who is behind NSCC", an entity they actually has to work with Robinhood on a daily basis! HE IS LYING. He claimed that he doesn't know what goes on in the NSCC to make those (VERY SHADY AND DISCRETIONARY) "requirement calculations", washing his hands. Remember, in practice the SEC does not monitor those subjective requirements. So they can do whatever they want, because it is a monopoly and the ONLY central clearing house for ALL brokers in the US.  Is Vlad telling all the truth or the complete story? Of course not. Citadel has an interest in Melvin Capital, and Citadel securities makes up the lions share of Robinhood's revenues. This is only one of the many links in the industry. They are all heavily incentiviced to help each other. Those arbitrary calculations are completely biased given the interests of the very owners of the NSCC and their friends.   OUTRAGEOUS is the most descriptive term for this whole story.|2021-02-03 10:07:40

lur3bo|lbl62i|lbl62i|13|This is probably going to get downvoted whatsoever but really I just want to share my concern.  I am retarded and I don't know much of what I'm about to say, but I'm hoping someone less retarded than me can prove me otherwise/explain clearer.  With all the price falling and short interest % decreasing, short ladder attack, market manipulation or that it's "impossible" for them to cover most of them in a short amount of time or whatever arguments that exist out there.... i think it's time to think realistically for once....  Let's think realistically and don't keep lying to ourselves - hedge fund companies are not stupid people and knowing all the hype and media reporting it all around the world, they also know the risk that once more people from around the world starts buying it up to join the hype, it will keep driving up the prices - do you think they will be stupid to keep playing this game and increase their losses? I personally don't think so unless someone less retarded than me can prove me otherwise.  There are statements flying around saying they've also put more short positions when the price reached over $400+ and they're now able to recover most of their losses since the prices have dipped so much, as well as closing out most of their original short position (even if that costs them $30-40 billion+ ; a cost they're willing to undertake rather than losing even more given there's more people all around the world buying it now.. would they rather lose an additional $30-40 billion+ or keep playing this game and losing $100billion+).  I know we don't have a definite answer for an accurate short interest %, but news media outlets are reporting short interest are down to 39%, most of you here are still counter arguing and saying S3 are reporting more than 100%.  Right now, everything is a gamble and I fear we're all lying to ourselves without seeing the reality, thoughts anyone???  I am still holding 35@240|2021-02-03 06:29:01

lwnbs0|lbl62i|lbl62i|6|First time commenter here. I’ll start off with I’m a  moron so I don’t expect anyone to learn anything from me. Before last week I had never heard of wsb. But I’ve been so inspired by what this community has done this past week. I know it’s not supposed to be about sticking it to the hedge funds or the system, just about making money. But inadvertently you guys have managed to do both. I didn’t get in on GameStop because I don’t have much disposable income these days and I was scared to lose what I don’t have. I’ve got sick parents to take care of and stress related to money rules my life. What you guys did last week was once in a lifetime. Is there any way we could try for twice? Pick a new cheap stock to blow up and make all of us money? Because although it’s not hedge funds we’re after, I am walking proof of the rigged system. My parents were swindled multiple times by crooked lenders, and I’m still dealing with the fallout all these years later. Just want to be part of something and make enough money to not constantly be tense and worrying. Anyone else feel like I do?|2021-02-03 14:45:26

Small change in volume = massive change in price!!!   That’s why Robinhood and others are restricting VOLUME!!  They have ARTIFICIALLY dropped price because they want us to sell.  BUT they ARE buying shares AH to cover. For  $GME , all of our price action has been AH!  To get the squeeze, you force them to buy DURING the day. Not a single share can be sold after hours. Price doesn’t matter right now - they can even drop it to $5. As soon as squeeze us triggers, stock will be $1000+    Problem with lowering price is also that it becomes MORE affordable, and WE will trigger squeeze.    The halts are to prevent volatility - prevent squeeze.   So to get squeeze, not a single share can be sold AH. FORCE them to buy during the day. If price drops, buy. SIMPLE. WE CAN TRIGGER THE SQUEEZE!    My 2 cents.I ape. I dunno.|2021-02-03 14:46:19

lvs7h2|lbl62i|lbl62i|4|What's "fail to deliver" regarding stocks?    From my understanding, person A wants to buy stock X.  Person B wants to sell stock X. Person A and B agree that stock X is worth Y dollars.  They then go to a clearing house, which takes Person A's money and person B's "stock". They "give the stock" to person A and the money to person B.  Catch is, it sounds like clearing houses have special rules where they can "create a stock out of thin air" since they are deemed as the most trustworthy source for being the middle man and they have 21 days to actually get the stock to cover for the "created out of thin air" stock that they made. Side note, it sounds like most people and non big dogs have 2 days to actually produce the stock but the clearing houses seem to have 21 days. Digressing, it sounds like if the clearing houses don't actually purchase the stock they "sold" to person A, then that goes into a pile of "fail to deliver" stocks.   Reason I am asking is because it looks like there are a shit ton of fail to deliver stocks for GME. If my understanding is correct, it sounds like a lot of stocks were created out of thin air and that can only last so long. So if the squeezers hold, it should be blind to happen eventually, right?  At some point, the clearing houses are going to need to get those fail to deliver stocks back and that's when the squeeze will happen?  But then again, I'm newly retarded and trying to get my bearings with the DD.|2021-02-03 11:17:43

luvxib|lbl62i|lbl62i|20|I'm worried for everyone here being ultra optimistic about stock prices rising up. Everyone seem to be in meme mode, rocket to the moon and whatnot. The hype is almost over and I'm predicting a huge shift and losses that will cause chaos in this community.  I'm also very worried for the beginners that jumped on board thinking this is not serious. Stocks is not a game, hedgefunds knows what wsb is up to and they are honestly just bigger than wsb. They know what to do. Most of wsb aren't even in sync, just going with the flow.  Wsb is under the public eye, all the recognition and secrets held cannot last. HF will be a step ahead because it's their career. We destroyed them and exposed them. But they don't care.  I'm also concerned about those who are about to lose a lot of funds and don't know when to cut their losses.   But for the poor who took the opportunity to better themselves and their families. You guys, I'm really happy for you for taking advantage to get yourself back up from the ground. Get your medical, things you need and try to get a sustaining job when covid is over. Manage well and good luck!  But for the meme fellas, please be more serious when it's time to pull the plug about the memes, pull the plug. I don't want to see people go into self harm. We don't have absolute power, but I'll be happy if this subreddit proved me wrong since a lot of people will benefit. But I can't help but worry.  Please know the risks and risk only what you can risk, not blindly going all in and eating ramen for 2 weeks etc. That's not good for your health personally speaking. Look after yourselves and how you see things.|2021-02-03 07:20:31

lvrle3|lbl62i|lbl62i|5|Noob question: why have the charts for AMC and GME been almost identical the past few days?  I’ve been watching the charts since last week, and every morning without fail AMC and GME have the same general pattern. None of the other stocks I follow have such similar or even remotely close patterns. Why is this? Lots of people holding combined with ladder attacks? It doesn’t seem like they would naturally mirror each other so closely. Again, I’m a noob and just trying to wrap my head around this.|2021-02-03 11:13:37

In my thoughts, WSB was a place for fellow retards who made wild bets on OTM calls (and other nice things like going long on oil futures when it went negative). Those guys are the OG retards! It was just about bets, hence the name.  GME was also some kind of wild bet at the beginning which some became a class conflict. Ok, WSB won, the point has been made. But at which cost ?   Now I feel it's only about GME, AMC, ..., trying to stick it to HFs or even conspiration theories.  Going from 1M members to 8M just ruined the thing. (like many things when they go "mainstream")  It's just my sentiment and I leave the debate opened.|2021-02-03 11:47:02

lvlhu6|lbl62i|lbl62i|17|   **WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS NOT A SELL OFF, THIS IS PART OF THE STRATEGY**  Melvin Capital will throw lots of devious tricks like short selling at us to make it look the stock is falling. Don't fall for it.  Do not sell if you see any of the following:  1. The stock drops by 50% in a day. This is just hedgies pushing it down using ladder attacks to make it look like the squeeze is over. 2. SEC reports show that the shorts have covered their positions. This is misinformation spread by Wall Street. 3. GME drops down to $1 share 4. GME declares bankruptcy 5. GME is delisted by the NY Stock Exchange Commission 6. Your grandchildren in the future are working in investment banking and are telling you to stop posting "💎🖐️ diamond hands 💎🖐️ " every time someone mentions a company that went out of business 50 years ago  These are all classic hedge fund tricks to make you think the squeeze is over, when it hasn't been sqozen.|2021-02-03 10:32:33

lv1ihf|lbl62i|lbl62i|2|**Revolut App Trading Update for GME & AMC in EUROPE - 3/2/2021 (yesterday)**  From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: **GME**) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: **AMC**) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  ## What does this mean for me?  You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.  None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.  ## Why is this happening?  When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.  This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.  ## When will they be available again to buy?  This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

lv9881|lbl62i|lbl62i|2|I've been noticing this for the past few days, but in the order book on RH there's listed a sell order for $100.00 worth 10,000+ shares, and then a buy order for $90.00 worth similarly 10,000+ shares, and these are the only orders with anywhere NEAR 10,000 in shares. What impact does this have on the price? Please only smart ape answers.  EDIT: Side note, as the price drops, the buy and sell order adjusts by $5 increments downward over time. This started in the $200's and has continued consistently since then. Is this what everyone has been referring to as short ladder attacks, or is this something else?|2021-02-03 09:07:44

lw7q37|lbl62i|lbl62i|2|This is my one attempt for the day to not shit post about Colombian girls, my aapl calls and masturbating into condoms.  MARKET OVERVIEW: relatively quiet day. Stocks are up on better than expected ADP job report, better PMI surveys from Markit and ISM. GME is up continuing to squeeze hedge funds, creating a potential negative pressure on indexes as shorts have to cover.  Bond market MBS prices are down in all coupons.  MARKET DETAILS:  ADP job report: private payroll firms released monthly report estimating 174,000 new jobs I. January, far greater than the 49,000 expected. Great improvement over December loss of 123,000 jobs. This data isn't considered as reliable as the Department of Labor which reports a larger data set. One subset of this info is 35,000 new travel/leisure jobs being added,  PMI Survey: private firm Markit and ISM released surveys from purchasing managers in the service industry. Both slightly better than expected. Surveys measure activity and future sentiment. Markit came out with 58.3 in January, better than the 57.5 in December. ISM  58.7, better than 56.8 prediction and last months 57.2.  Tomorrow reports: Initial jobless claims and factory orders. Both are expecting increase from December.  Note: this info is from my boomer company. Thought the gamestop mention was interesting with that in mind. People have been talking about it in meetings too, lol... They say this isn't financial advice but fuck them it is to me.|2021-02-03 12:59:11

Now imagine that one only one company owned the basin in Texas.. This is the case with Recaf with the Basin in Namibia.  “Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECO-V; RECAF-OTCQX) is a small company that has secured the oil and gas rights to an entire sedimentary basin in Namibia and Botswana--both very friendly to oil exploration, with very low royalty fees (5%) and an estimated 18.2 billion barrels of oil in place.”  I’ve been following ReconAfrica for a few weeks after someone posted about it here. Did my DD and there’s literally nothing but good news. This small Canadian company run by a group of long-time oil execs has secured exclusive development rights to an absolutely bonkers oil drilling prospect. The governments are fully on board with this deal and are supportive of the company operating there.

This extra milisec of time allowed them to execute algorithms to go against the bid and Ask price of brokerages. They’re a middleman, they’ve probably made billions over these short squeezes.

You're probably in this for the long haul now whether you planned to or not. Holding your shares at a 1k ransom might have worked if the Game was fair (now we know it isn't).   I think the apes may have scooped up enough shares with diamond hands to hold the value around 70-90.   GameStop is making big moves and now has unlimited potential. GME is now an Internationally recognized brand due to the free advertisement from the very media that attempted to derail the movement. People got rich, some paper hands lost their bag.   Gamestops potential? Esports, New Consoles, Build a PC, Upcoming Movie, Cloud Gaming, Streaming, and so much more.  2-5 years from now your bags will likely be split 1:5, leaving room for the upcoming zoomers to invest in our legacy. Being raised in the Virtual world due to a Pandemic that forced most of them to stay inside.   Once you finally look into those bags you held with diamond hands you could be looking at more tendies then DFV himself. The Paper handed traders green or red will gamble away the next meme stock pushed by the very hegdies hey tried to squeeze into oblivion.  Mostly speculation, i'm retarded but Mark Cuban is less retarded and says hold if you can.|2021-02-03 10:45:10

These people are obviously against what we've got going here and they're trying hard to distract us into splitting our investments and not having enough hold on the important stocks.     I'm in for 500 AMC and holding. Lost 60%, not even thinking about selling. Stay strong and believe, people. Just don't invest money you can't stand to lose, that's never a good call.

lvg961|lbl62i|lbl62i|3|Jushi Holdings Inc (JUSHF) - great company, was granted 1 of the 5 licenses to open a vertical integrated dispensary in VA. They received the Northern VA area (Alexandria, Fairfax, Arlington). this is the smallest area by size, but has the highest population of people per the size of the operating are. No other competition will be within this zone, and you can expect many who do not live in that immediate area to buy there anyway due to the high concentration of work commuters to that area. Also as Amazon arrives in Crystal City (in Arlington) expect a high influx of more cannabis users to the area. They also have a strong presence in Pennsylvania and are also due to open dispensaries in Ohio. they also have a small presence in Illinois which will be a huge market for cannabis in the coming years.    Another more risky cannabis stock is OrganiGram Holdings Inc (OGI) - they have run into some issues with the regulations in Canada, and have faced challenges from COVID. However they have managed to avoid higher overhead than other cannabis companies in the US by focusing on their one and only cannabis growing and processing facility. The grow room is a 3 tier grow, so they are maximizing their grow area. They also having some very impressive "Nano Emulsion Technology" - essentially they are selling cannabis in powder form that can be mixed into any drink of your choice. What is most exciting about this to me is the THC  supposedly will only take 10-15 minutes to metabolize (give you the feeling of being high). Being a medical patient since 2014 I find this super cool. Never before have I come across a cannabis drink or edible that kicks into effect that quickly. If this product truly works how they say it will, this will be HUGE for the cannabis industry.    Another company I really like is Cresco Labs Inc. (CRLBF) - Their concentrates are only the best there is. TO ME, they are the Apple of concentrates. Right now there a ton of different companies trying to ride the cannabis industry wave, but 10 years or so from now, when all the little players have fallen out of the game, expect Cresco Labs to still be standing tall. I have been a medical patient in Colorado and Maryland, and I personally have never been into a dispensary that didn't have Cresco concentrates on their shelves. They also have a handful of other brands under their company. Their recent purchase of Bluma Wellness is also huge, because it will allow them to put their products in 575 dispensaries through California (the biggest cannabis market in the world). They also are expanding in Florida, and as of yesterday they received a recreational pot license in Arizona which will allow them to put their products into the states dispensary Here are my favorite cannabis stocks   Finally, I would look at Silver Spike Acquisition Corp (SSPK) - They are a SPAC (Special purpose acquisition company). They have raised funds to bring a privately held company to the market, through way of merger, rather than an IPO. They specifically want to bring a company to the market that specializes in plant based medicine. On December 10 they announced that there board has voted to merge with WeedMap Holdings, and WMH board has also unanimously voted for the merger. It is likely the deal will be finalized in the short term  Sincerely,  NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR  P.S — do your OWN research & formulate your OWN opinions.|2021-02-03 09:56:42

So here would be my thought about this, in view of trying to alleviate the problem of not being as easily able to identify Bots: If it would become a mainstream trend for people to switch to habitually edit their posts, may this help to more easily see which comments may more safely have been written by humans and which not?   2nd edit attempt (not sure when to edit to make the edit show up next to the name, but maybe one has to wait at least a minute?)|2021-02-03 10:35:04

lv1jno|lbl62i|lbl62i|13|\*\*\* PLEASE READ \*\*\*  I'm going to state some very basic facts. Go ahead and downvote me, I fully expect it, since that is what delusional redditors do when people state facts, for some stupid reason.  1. Melvin Capital HAD millions of shorted shares they needed to cover. 2. For an entire day, buying was disabled on damn near every stock purchasing website, app, etc. worldwide. 3. While buying was disabled for individual investors, 10s of millions of shares were bought as the price was dropping to less than 30% of that day's high. 4. After buying was re-enabled, everyone was limited to to a total of 1, 5, 10, 20 (depending on the app/website). 5. While everyone was limited, still 10s of millions of shares were bought as the price continued to rise and eventually fall to under $100. 6. The short interest being reported is now much lower than it was. 7. Melvin Capital has lost 53% of its net worth, billions of dollars. 8. The only way you lose money in the stock markets is to sell lower than you bought. 9. Since Melvin Capital has lost billions of dollars in January, that means they bought millions of shares at a higher price than they sold. 10. Since Melvin Capital already bought millions of shares at higher prices than they sold, totaling in the billions, that means the squeeze is over. The shorts have been covered.  If you're going to downvote me, talk shit, argue, etc., please at least be an adult and have an intelligent argument, and tell me where I am wrong. If you can't tell me where I am wrong, then please keep scrolling.  &#x200B;  Edit: Fixed my retardation on #8.|2021-02-03 08:10:10

lwpj8z|lbl62i|lbl62i|5|I hadn't invested that much into GME but I sold it and cut my losses. I technically saved more money than I lost so even though I lost a chunk, I didn't lose it all.  Still hoping for AMC to go up but unlike GME, I'm holding at AMC because I believe it will genuinely go up after covid (maybe not immediately) as people will be desperate to get back to normalcy. So that's a long term investment for me.  I was mainly in GME cuz of the hype and volatility and thought I could make a quick buck.  What really made me quit GME was when I realized the irrationality of the investors for that stock. It quickly became about more than making money. It was a "movement" or it was about "proving everyone wrong" or the myriad of other reasons ppl had. For many, unfortunately, it was that they just couldn't let go of the fact that IF they had sold earlier, they would've made hundreds of thousands or millions. They didn't want to accept the unrealized losses that they had.  I will continue to use this subreddit as a place to become aware of possible investments but that's all.|2021-02-03 15:00:03

lve0lt|lbl62i|lbl62i|2|Serious question about shorting:  I don't think I get the "diamond hand" plan.  As I understand it, the holders here are waiting for the hedgefund shorters to be obliged to buy back all the shares they owe and this enforced buy-back will drive the price up.  The "diamond hand" philosophy is that, the higher the price, the better so if we all hold that will keep the price high for when that moment comes.  My question is this: why does it matter if the price is high? If we all sold, the hedgefunds would still have the same obligation to buy back, and wouldn't this also drive the price up?  Like, it doesn't matter if it goes up from $200 to $400, or from $2 to $4, if you've got $1000 in GME, you end up with $2000 either way.  What am I missing? Thanks|2021-02-03 09:41:21

lupt3e|lbl62i|lbl62i|9|GME to $20 so my puts print. Then I'll buy it undervalued again.  What made DFV special is that he saw a value play y'all. GME was insanely undervalued at $4. It was insanely overvalued at $400... The only bull case at that point was the squeeze and momentum, which are both super fickle.   This David vs Goliath, fuck the hedge funds shit I see all over here is indicative of emotional trading. That is a great way to lose money.|2021-02-03 06:13:52

lvb0wk|lbl62i|lbl62i|7|    Lock up those shares …..  Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 09:20:21

lvch8j|lbl62i|lbl62i|6|Here’s the real talk some of y’all need to hear, if you invested in gme let’s talk about this so you don’t make the same mistake again. 1. Group of people (wsb) got together and bought a ton of shares of gme really cheap with millions of dollars.  2. That group set a plan to get a bunch of people on board to buying it Because the More people who buy in the more money they make 3. Queue the second wave of early investors (insiders) they buy millions of dollars worth. Gme shoots to the moon up to $300 now 4. Queue the retards. These guys are chasing the FOMO its really getting to them and somehow they reason to get in late and buy on the moon shooting for Jupiter at this point. All the while the early investors who started the manipulation of the stock are laughing because they all sold out billions bc who actually cares about the little guy? No one but the group of retards. U think you are fighting a war with the rich but in reality ur just buying into the BS story that the rich are feeding you so that you can ultimately put more money in their pockets. You hurt a couple rich people but in turn created more of them. You got played during their manipulation of the market and somehow a bunch of people are still spending their stimmies on something the big dawgs already cashed in. It’s toast.|2021-02-03 09:30:32
lvf6i3|lbl62i|lbl62i|7|Guys, I have a plan, read pls      So, first of all, this is not financial advice, I'm not an expert. Now, lets proceed.  So I read a lot of comments in this sub whinning about how GME is too expensive. AND LETS BE FUCKING REAL, WE ARE 8,000,000+ RETARDS IN THIS SUB **pretty sure a lot of that people really can't afford to buy stocks at $225.** So, what then, are we about to waste so much potential? Are we about to waste more than 3 Mill users who could lift up the spirits? **NO. I don't think we will.**  So, ok motherfucker, then how the actual fuck are going to get enough money to spend in GME?. Well I made a plan, a simple one, one that could become a real blow to the system and the demise of the suit's man who we all despise. **But to make it we all need to cooperate.** **So listen well you little apes, because we are about to blow the system (again).**  What are we going to do? easy, we have to explote the market like we did with GME. We will buy a fucking lot of stocks of a company to blow up their value to the sky, and in my personal opinion, that should be NOKIA.  **Why Nokia fucking flacid pennis man?** Well. Nokia's stock value is $4.5 approximately, something EVERYONE can afford to spend, everyone should be able to get something and most importantly. ITS A FUCKING FORGOTTEN KING IN THE CELL PHONE INDUSTRY, HOW MANY OF US HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE AMAZING THING NOKIA DID BACK IN 1990? Its a company that deserves a lot more and i think it has a good future ahead.  So, let me explain the plan step by step for all of the monkes around here.  **STEP 1: NOKIA'S FORNICATION**  We all going to buy Nokia's stock until she (or he idk) starts screaming "Please stop! Tt's too big!". That will happen when their stock value reaches $300, why 300? becouse, with that value everyone who invested that 4.5 dollars will be able now to get at least 1 of GME's stocks. So, **when Nokia's stock value reaches $300 we all sell our stocks.** Fucking pussy if you sell it earlier.  **STEP 2: INSEMINATION**  Ok, now we all have money and a lot of HF will be crying again, now what? Easy, you get all that money you got and fucking invest it on GME's stock. Lets see it this way, imagine if of this 8,000,000 users, at least 2,000,000 invest in more GME's stock, that will be a HUGE blow to the HF and not only will raise GME value, **it wil rise everyone's spirits in this sub and will shut the pussies of all who keep posting "iS iT oVeR? wE lOsT? wHy Am I sUkInG a HF bOsS' dIcK?"** And then, get EGM to the FUCKING MOON AND BEYOND. **And I will cut your pennis in too if you dare to sell your GME stock.**  **STEP 3: SQUEEZE MILLIONARE'S TITS**  And the part everyone is wating for, whit that inyection of more people and more stocks bought, the squeeze will probably happen sooner, and well, we could even rise the GME stock's value to 2k or more, yeah, a great profit for everyone.  **AND THATS IT, THATS FUCKING IT, IT HAS NOT A LOT OF SCIENCE, THATS THE MASTER PLAN OF A RETARDED GUY WHO WANTS TO SEE THE WORLD BURN, WE CAN DO THIS AND MORE!**  **BUT, I NEED YOUR HELP, THIS PLAN IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE HELP OF YOU GUYS, WE ALL HAVE TO BE STRONG AND COOPERATE WITH THE REST TO GET ALL OF OUR DREAMS COME TRUE, ALONE WE ARE WEAK AND THE SYSTEM WILL DEVOUR US, BUT WHEN WE FIGHT TOGETHER NOTHING WILL STOP US :'D**  **APES. TOGETHER. STRONG!!! AND LETS GET THAT GME STOCK TO THE FUCKING MOON!!!!!!**|2021-02-03 09:49:23

lv2e8q|lbl62i|lbl62i|6|some good cannabis stocks (good variety)  Jushi Holdings Inc (JUSHF) - great company, was granted 1 of the 5 licenses to open a vertical integrated dispensary in VA. They received the Northern VA area (Alexandria, Fairfax, Arlington). this is the smallest area by size, but has the highest population of people per the size of the operating are. No other competition will be within this zone, and you can expect many who do not live in that immediate area to buy there anyway due to the high concentration of work commuters to that area. Also as Amazon arrives in Crystal City (in Arlington) expect a high influx of more cannabis users to the area. They also have a strong presence in Pennsylvania and are also due to open dispensaries in Ohio. they also have a small presence in Illinois which will be a huge market for cannabis in the coming years.   &#x200B;  Another more risky cannabis stock is OrganiGram Holdings Inc (OGI) - they have run into some issues with the regulations in Canada, and have faced challenges from COVID. However they have managed to avoid higher overhead than other cannabis companies in the US by focusing on their one and only cannabis growing and processing facility. The grow room is a 3 tier grow, so they are maximizing their grow area. They also having some very impressive "Nano Emulsion Technology" - essentially they are selling cannabis in powder form that can be mixed into any drink of your choice. What is most exciting about this to me is the THC  supposedly will only take 10-15 minutes to metabolize (give you the feeling of being high). Being a medical patient since 2014 I find this super cool. Never before have I come across a cannabis drink or edible that kicks into effect that quickly. If this product truly works how they say it will, this will be HUGE for the cannabis industry.  &#x200B;  Another company I really like is Cresco Labs Inc. (CRLBF) - Their concentrates are only the best there is. TO ME, they are the Apple of concentrates. Right now there a ton of different companies trying to ride the cannabis industry wave, but 10 years or so from now, when all the little players have fallen out of the game, expect Cresco Labs to still be standing tall. I have been a medical patient in Colorado and Maryland, and I personally have never been into a dispensary that didn't have Cresco concentrates on their shelves. They also have a handful of other brands under their company. Their recent purchase of Bluma Wellness is also huge, because it will allow them to put their products in 575 dispensaries through California (the biggest cannabis market in the world). They also are expanding in Florida, and as of yesterday they received a recreational pot license in Arizona which will allow them to put their products into the states dispensary  &#x200B;  Finally, I would like at Silver Spike Acquisition Corp (SSPK) - They are a SPAC (Special purpose acquisition company). They have raised funds to bring a privately held company to the market, through way of merger, rather than an IPO. They specifically want to bring a company to the market that specializes in plant based medicine. On December 10 they announced that there board has voted to merge with WeedMap Holdings, and WMH board has also unanimously voted for the merger. It is likely the deal will be finalized in the short term  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Sincerely.  Not a financial advisor  P.S - Do your own research, and make your own judgements.|2021-02-03 08:16:59

Apple has more cash on hand than the fed. Will they even try to make good on a claim of a webull or RH disappears?  My faith in America is shaken because of the way brokers behaved, rejected stop loss orders, changed the rules in a way that happens to favor billionaires, and aren’t even a tiny bit afraid of the SEC or a lawsuit, or anything their customers can do. We have no meaningful recourse. None. Why is FDIC different?  I think for me it’s time for Blockfi until yellen tries to ban that too.|2021-02-03 14:17:46

luph4n|lbl62i|lbl62i|8|Bottom line: naked short selling creates ‘phantom shares’. This can be hidden for a lot of complex reasons. Clever apes understand, and no need for autist apes to do the same: just follow the clever apes.      ‘Phantom shares’ drive real shares out of the market - into hiding. Like Gresham’s Law for currencies: bad money drives good money out of circulation. Zimbabweans know this.      Eventually, however, the bad stuff becomes worthless and then the real stuff becomes precious.      You hold your GME till the bad stuff is exposed and worthless. No matter how much you are tempted to exchange your precious GME for shit.      The longer you hold your GME, the more ‘real’ it becomes because of T+2 settlement rule and other rules. The more the system MUST identify you as the actual owner of real shares, not phantoms.      This is a game of time, not price.|2021-02-03 06:09:47

luy6z1|lbl62i|lbl62i|4|    Lock up those shares …..  Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 07:41:30

New legislation is going to allow electronic health records to be used as indented, and CLOV is positioned well to take advantage. Share price currently under 14 bucks, this thing all but guaranteed to grow to 15+ (likely 20+ I’d argue). New news that vaccination will be mostly done at local pharmacies/Walmart’s and what not. Guess who partnered with Walmart to provide Medicaid? That’s right, CLOV. CLOV is a tech company masquerading as an insurance company and will disrupt existing insurance companies in a major way soon. This thing hasn’t moved because everyone is so focused on short mania. This is the bottom, and I’m buying every chance I can here and everything under 19.   Oh and of course the Chamath angle.

lwdmuu|lbl62i|lbl62i|3|To be honest, I'm shocked by the number of posts saying how they have invested their life savings or their kids' college funds into a stock which is only driven by irrational buying not backed by actual fundamentals. It seems to be a matter of pride how much losses one is willing to occur. I mean, is that really something you wanna bet your life savings on? To demonstrate the diamond hands in an anonymous forum? This will not end well. For your own and your kids sake, have a think about this, are you gonna tell your kids one day that it was great to have been one of the retard-apes but they can forget about college? I wish you all the best but really sad to see so many losses all around.   As has been referred in many posts, the market is not short the stock anymore (thanks, f\*\*\*ing Robinhood, Citadel, and other crooks) at a level that would drive a scary short covering rally. Yes, the market is illiquid but keep in mind that with every rally, the one who sells last is the loser. Good luck and have a think before you invest / decide to hold.|2021-02-03 13:39:07

RH is already worried about customer backlash once this saga is over AND the biggest reason of all is NO ONE knows how this will end, not the HF managers, not the WSB retards, not the brokerages - it's still anyone's game !

luli73|lbl62i|lbl62i|1|Hello fellow 🙌💎 Apes! We really went through some seriously rough shit this past week huh? For some reason I can’t make a post out of this, no idea why. So here it is in the comments instead!   As we all may (or may not) have noticed, GME is kind of a global phenomenon now. Apart from the obvious stock market affect of GME being in every newspaper on the planet last week, there is also the perk of the insane free marketing that it offered. I spent the last 10 years in Asia and never once saw a GameStop, now we’ve got all kinds of Asian Retards joining in the fray. Honestly, theres never been an ACTUAL marketing campaign that would have this kind of global reach, it hasn’t even been achieved yet. Not even by some of the most successful and influential marketing agencies out there. This, my fellow ape, will lead to an influx of customers worldwide as they do actually have stores in lots of parts of the world, sometimes under a different name.  However the goodness doesn’t stop there my fellow 💎🙌 ape! although it’s definitely a small % of the overall earnings, LOTS of you beautiful beautiful retards passed forward your gains by, for example, buying games for children at a children’s hospital who needed a little more joy in their day tons of switches and games so they can at least smile while they go through whatever it is they are going through.   Now I know a lot of us might have already forgotten, the hedge funds did, but there’s a new generation console out now! Although there’s very limited supply, they must be selling lots of accessories and games at the very least.   Another factor that will play a small part into this, as dumb as it sounds, is Mr.Beast buying out a GameStop shop and posting the video on his main channel as well as his “shorts” channel more recently during the GameStop frenzy. Not only is this free marketing once again for GME among the NON-news reading age group, but this is actual physical money being spent at a GME store, even if not that much on the grand scale of things.  TL;DR: I believe the Q4 earnings of GME are going to be so juicy that it will literally blow the Shorts out of the water.  I honestly like the stock. Don’t sell your golden tickets! BUY THE DISCOUNTS!  I’m not a financial advisor, but I AM long GME. GME to infinity and beyond 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|2021-02-03 05:16:20

lvjz3r|lbl62i|lbl62i|3|    Lock up those shares …..  Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.  Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.  AGAIN.  The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.  How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!  Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.  Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.  AGAIN.  BUY stocks. HOLD strong. Place daily SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks.|2021-02-03 10:22:18

lwn66m|lbl62i|lbl62i|2| And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,    Then the piper will lead us to reason.    And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,    And the forests will echo with laughter.      If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,    It's just a spring clean for the May queen.    Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run    There's still time to change the road you're on.    And it makes me wonder.      Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,    The piper's calling you to join him,    Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know    Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?      And as we wind on down the road    Our shadows taller than our soul.    There walks a lady we all know    Who shines white light and wants to show    How everything still turns to gold.    And if you listen very hard    The tune will come to you at last.    When all are one and one is all    To be a rock and not to roll.      And she's buying a stairway to heaven.|2021-02-03 14:44:23

But now with the news of adding new execs, we are getting real traction with actual moves the company is doing to raise its value. That and the fact Microsoft already announced that its next gen consoles will continue to use disks. That’s huge for GME because it’s whole model is to sell used games.

lv7cx2|lbl62i|lbl62i|1|How long does it typically take for money to move from my Samsung Money account to my Investment account with SoFi? I decided I'd use SoFi since I already had a Samsung Pay account which I believe came with the SoFi account, or at least I set it up at the same time. The Samsung Pay account had $10 in it from when I initially set it up some time ago, and I've never actually used the service.  I went ahead and tried to deposit $300 from my bank account to the Samsung Money account on Jan 29th and it told me it would take until February 3rd. This was a longer wait than I expected so I tried another transfer of $300 directly from my bank account to the SoFi investment account instead. It didn't give me a date for the deposit.  Flash forward to today, the initial $300 deposit has hit the Samsung Pay card, and I tried to transfer the $310 on it to the SoFi investment account. Much like the $300 from my bank account, the money is transferring but it doesn't say how long it will take. I expected with Samsung Pay and SoFi being so connected it would transfer instantly.  Tl;dr how long will my bank transfer from January 29th and my Samsung Pay transfer from today (February 3rd) take to hit my SoFi investment account?|2021-02-03 08:54:20

Which is crazy to me because if I do well it will only prosper them too.  I really want to cockpunch the naysayers now.  This is even more personal.|2021-02-03 10:07:36
lvk021|lbl62i|lbl62i|1|A STUDY IN CANNABIS OPPORTUNITIES:  PART1 **TRTC** 🚀🚀🚀**TRTC**:  Was the first cannabis company to go public back in 2012, they went on a tear until the Canadian market launched a ton of competitors.  Currently they have a $50 MKT CAP with COVID behind them they should be able to get back to at least a $20M revenue run rate.  Major shareholders have lockups at .30 cents.  Most interesting though is the company invested into HydroFarm (**HYFM**) Nasdaq for $5 million a couple years ago.  HYFM just went public last December currently trading over $80 a share.  Terra Tech **TRTC** has 600,00 shares and 300,00 warrants with a $16.85 strike price.  Combined that's close to $70 Million in value.  AGAIN the company has a $50 Million market cap and owns $70 Million of **HYFM** stock not to mention their retail and cultivation assets in CA and NV.  IMHO it's only a matter of time before the market realizes the arbitrage.  Already **TRTC** stock ran from .07 to .30 but there is still upside from my perch. And this stock has a history of trading into the $5.00 area.  With cannabis legalization on plate there are several catalysts.  Good trading you TARDS!!!!DIAMONDS ARE MY HANDS 💎🙌 .....PART 2: Kushco **KSHB** coming soon.|2021-02-03 10:22:30

lvf1av|lbl62i|lbl62i|-1|I think there is still some bit of hope for small gains on AMC depending on when you got in but not GME sorry guys. I really don’t know why so many people are taking pleasure in the losses, I could understand if it was sophisticated investors who made a bad call but most holding GME now aren’t in that boat. Even though I sold mine at a relatively small loss I really do hope it goes up again for all you still holding, but just think that the chance of that happening shrinks the longer this goes on.   I’m sorry to say it but they won when they shut down RH last week at the peak. You can steal some money from the rich and powerful when they’re not looking like many did last week, but you can’t win a war against them fought on their terrain. If you want a Revolution you’ll have to go full on Neo- Bolshevik. Maybe this sentiment will drive people to hang on harder, to “prove the bears wrong.” Best of luck to you, honestly, but that’s Qanon logic.|2021-02-03 09:48:23

lvbugz|lbl62i|lbl62i|-2|I have a very personal story to share. In 2008, when I was just a boy, the markets crashed. My dad, an honest and hardworking man, lost everything. Our small town's economy collapsed. The rivers dried up, the farms stopped producing, and war and famine overtook the region. One day, my dad and I were out foraging for food in the remnants of an abandoned gas station, when a group of hedge fund managers pulled up in a murder bus like something out of Mad Max. They murdered my dad before my eyes, and then ate his body. I was just a kid, so I don't know much, but the one thing that I do know is that they said they were short a ton of $FEYE shares. My dad's last words to me were "Son, avenge me. Make $FEYE moon". None of this was covered in the mainstream media, which helped the hedge fund managers cover the whole thing up. Even the SEC was on their side; in fact I think the hedge funds sent my dad's heart to the SEC as a bribe. Ever since that day, I have vowed to make $FEYE stock moon so that the hedge funds could feel the pain and loss I felt. Are you with me, fellow apes? Do you want to take down the hedge funds? If we could just get it to $23 by 2/5, that would be great.|2021-02-03 09:26:05

The latest evidence is Kia Motors (ticker: 000270. Korea) stock. Shares in the South Korean auto maker are up almost 10% after a report in a Korean newspaper that Apple (AAPL) will pick it as its partner for a coming iCar.  The report says Apple will invest $3.6 billion in Kia. Kia's market capitalization is about $36 billion, so that would amount to a 10% stake.|2021-02-03 07:36:16

Conveniently ignore all the data that refutes your thesis and continue whipping up more conspiracies.  Keep holding like DFV, who already cashed out $13m in profit and bought GME at 1/100 of your cost basis. So keep saying “if he’s still in I’m in”, perhaps you’ll feel better.

lur1ok|lbl62i|lbl62i|-25|You GME bagholders are one of a kind. You have to face the ugly truth, that the stock you bought at $400+ is about to tank to $20 soon. Keep on holding, because I’m sure it’ll pay off - GME has great fundamentals right?   Enjoy being in denial, jerking each other off “the squeeze has not been squoze”. Conveniently ignore all the data that refutes your thesis and continue conjuring more conspiracies.  Keep holding like DFV, who already cashed out $13m in profit and bought GME at 1/100 of your cost basis. So keep saying “if he’s still in I’m in”, perhaps you’ll feel better.  But facts don’t care about your feelings*. You GME FOMOers are fucked and you know it.   *Source: https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/695638866993115136?s=21|2021-02-03 06:28:29

You pushed for more and people who weren't smart enough bought in.  It is shameful that you didn't tell people to stop and invest elsewhere.  You proved this wasn't a populist movement by letting people go out like that.   If you want to try this again, you get the stock safely to a multiple and sit on it. GME shouldn't be bought into more.   Pick another stock and tell everyone to keep GME and also buy XYZ and ABC until they hit 5x the original value.  If you care about more than your own pocketbook, that is what you should strive for.  I didn't invest into GME as I missed the original momentum. I wouldn't have bought a stock that's worth less than 18 per at 400 because that is insane.  But you all did convince people to do that, which is against the spirit of the original plan.  I am sorry to everyone who signed on for a revolution and got  exploited by capitalism, yet again.   Please take care, everyone.|2021-02-03 11:17:48

luspry|lbl62i|lbl62i|-4|Fear or Greed.   It has run the markets for generations.  FEAR of the shorts drove up the GME price, got people involved. However, history has proved over and over that there is a point where GREED takes over even for the most altruistic of people and they take their winning and move on to the next opportunity.  The GME story is over, the idea of the story will be logged in the Wall Street history that I have been part of for over 30 years. People naturally will move on to the next idea.  It is my hope that the Markets will continue to evolve giving all people the opportunity to invest fairly in any company they want. I also hope that it continues to make good companies great and force bad companies to either become good or die.  I hope GME as a company lives on, IDK if it is as I believe management is weak and not very good. IDK why management wasn't selling more stock at higher levels to raise cash like others have? Has the time come for GME to die? If so, the markets will decide.|2021-02-03 06:47:23

lul70s|lbl62i|lbl62i|-6|It’s very inspiring when actors come out. I’m not being facetious. It’s nice and kids look up to them. It’s inspired me to share my own coming out story in the hopes that kids know that you have to be who you are.   One night I gathered all my friends together and I finally told them I was gay. The responses were as follows “You owe everyone at this table money” and “Is this some type of scam?” Someone blurted out “We’re not paying for this meal, is that what this is about? You want us to pay for this? Did you go to the Bronx and buy cocaine with the money I lent you?”   I think it was tough for them to accept initially. Someone comforted me “I’m gonna throw out that box of files you left in my house. Are they evidence? Why did you drop them off and leave in the middle of the night? What’s wrong with you? Are you a criminal?” “How do you own a house? Can you even begin to explain that?”   I told them how hard it was “Ever since I was a boy I knew something wasn’t right” They were so curious “Why do you have three different business cards? It makes you seem like a con artist”. I answered “It’s quite simple really, when I was at my old company, I started a company with the person who sat next to me at lunch. Then another guy started eating with us so we started a company with him.   My success understandably perplexes you because I thrive despite being discriminated against because I’m a homosexual”. They were surprised by my courage “We have a hard time believing anything that comes out of your mouth because you’re a pathological liar. You tried to get fake mass cards printed up for your mother, who’s alive, to get out of a math test. So give us a minute with this”. I thanked them “I wanna thank you guys for being so good about this”. They put my mind at ease “No one cares about your sexuality. You’re not a good person”.    So all the kids out there take it from me. Just be who you are. The people that love you will support you. As I left I said “Your sister is in the market for a house. I could sit down with her”. One of my good friends looked deep into my eyes and said “I don’t want you anywhere near my family. It’s not the gay thing. I never wanted you near them. So please respect that”. It’s a gift to have someone really know you. When the check came back my card was declined.|2021-02-03 05:11:46

lvg3ic|lbl62i|lbl62i|-12|Gotta be honest here. I can't make my own posts so writing in here.  I'm 25, I have a degree in graphic design, I work in Mcdonalds flipping burgers, and sometime last year I decided to invest a little bit of money into stocks. Literally, it equaled out to about £75 that I put in to my account.  I didn't hear about squeezing gamestop stocks until last Friday when it spiked, and silly me, I thought, "if I don't do this, I will regret it." Well, part of me is regretting it now. Was it wishful thinking? Greed? I dont know. Friday I bought .5 of a share of gme before market close. Cost me £100 I took out of my savings (I dont have many bills to pay so it was fine). Monday, it dipped, and I thought "hey, these people might be on to something. They did make a billionaire cry on TV." So I bought another .5 share, just cause I like whole numbers. Yesterday it dipped again, and the 75 I had invested elsewhere, I sold and bought another .5 share, cause at this point, I think I might actually be retarded.  Today, on opening, it doesn't look like its dipping again, but it doesn't look like its going to climb either. Way I see it, if any of you are still making a profit on this, just sell and take your winnings. If it does spike, which I doubt, yea you might miss out on the big prize, but you won't have lost either. Don't let greed or wishful thinking blind you to the fact that this game is a casino, and the house always wins. Take your winnings and bounce. Dont buy more, if you're losing money, hold, but if you're making money, sell. Because in 10, 20, 30, years time, wallstreet will have forgotten you, the effects of this movement will have amounted to nothing, and you will regret not having taken your winnings when you had the chance.|2021-02-03 09:55:38

lwo5wg|lbl62i|lbl62i|-6|First they said the squeeze was going to happen last week. Then it was going to be this week. Then the consensus says it could take months. If that is the case, why not make money on other stocks and then as soon as the squeeze starts happening you throw money in? Does it matter if one buys at $100 or $500? If it is guaranteed to skyrocket beyond $1k, aren't you losing money by holding forever waiting for the pop? Remember, yall said it is going to take months and build up. So you can theoretically just check the stock every day and get in when it squeezes?|2021-02-03 14:51:06

The amount of misinformation eaten up by ape gang is incredible.  S3 and Ortex both show <50% SI.

luze1g|lbl62i|lbl62i|-20|For those wondering if you should hold GME: I have bad news for you - at current price it is overvalued. Chances are it will drop, my guess is it will drop to 40-50 and stabilize. The truth is it is not a 10 billion dollar company. Look at the market cap and ask yourself if it’s worth that much. Ask yourself How is it that Macy’s, has half the market cap of GME? Looking at the chart, it sure looks like the squeeze is over. FYI I have no position and giving my honest opinion.  AMÇ might be worth holding at current prices but the best you could hope for is getting your money back by middle of the year. I honestly don’t see it mooning for a loooong time. People who got in early already sold and only a whale coming in could boost the price substantially at this point|2021-02-03 07:52:07

lvbkke|lbl62i|lbl62i|-8|Ill admit I went paperhands. I invested 2k cause I wanted to try out stocks. Bought in at 330. Bailed at 88 on 5 of my 5.9 stocks cause I initially did this just to see where I could go with investing but also not just keep myself locked into 1 stock. So I have barely 1 stock in the game but I really wanted to see where 2k could take me and if I could properly invest in different things and eventually end up on the +.  &#x200B;  So Im still retarded with you all, but I did mostly bail so I could at least try out stocks and see how good I could go with cheaper stocks and if I could supplement income like this. I burned the 2k, not expecting any return but I also want more options over hold GME. =(   &#x200B;  Stay strong everyone else tho. I know Im the opposite of what you all want to see here.|2021-02-03 09:24:10

If you have life savings in this stock that you were hoping for a quick gain, I would really suggest for you to take profits if you can. Otherwise it's very likely that you'll end up a bagholder in the long run. If you're using just fun money, continue to gamble ahead if you want.

I plan on holding it long (at least 2 years until I graduate college) and not touching it again until then. I plan on learning as much as I can about stocks/trading in that timeframe. What would you guys suggest as a good long term play? The big boys like Apple or Tesla? Or sit on some weed stocks for years until it becomes legal?

Sorta obvious really, as shorting was in options, the easiest covering is opposite options to null out need to purchase shares. Since it is very rare for options to actually be executed into shares, actual shares do not have to be bought and sold.

luo3hp|lbl62i|lbl62i|-14|I just found a glorious copypasta:  Okay, I guess it's my turn to write one of these.  The use of the word "retard" is something many of us –and all of us should– take as seriously as racial and homophobic slurs. I am more forgiving to people for using it than with other slurs, even in my personal life, because public awareness of its severity isn't nearly where it should be.  The word is outdated and no longer used by the vast majority of academics, medical professionals, employers, educators, etc. I say "vast majority" in consideration for places that may be lagging behind in this widely dominant cultural shift(I'm guessing the deep south probably has a lot doctors and teachers dropping the r-words), and/or for other cultures and languages in which the word has a different meaning/translation.  With that being said, it is considered the slur that it is *here*, and will be treated as such here. Call me a SJW if you want... I sincerely don't care for the opinion of anyone who uses that as an insult.  The purpose of this post is to set a precedent, to spread awareness and to serve as a preliminary warning for anyone who might break this rule.  You can be better than this. Be better.  EDIT: I should mention that this person was indeed calling someone else a retard.|2021-02-03 05:52:02

YOU GUYS ARE WONDERFUL AND PLEASE PLEASE I KNOW IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO LOOK AT THE PRICE PLUMMET DOWN, AND I AM SURE YOUR HEART TELLS YOU TO SELL OUT BUT NO. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOURSELF THAT IF WE HOLD ON, THEN THE DEMAND IS NOT GOING TO FALL AND IF WE BUY THAT MAKES THE DEMAND INCREASE AND THE PRICE INCREASE TOO. HOWEVER IF WE GIVE IN TO THE MARKET MANIPULATIONS OF THE DODGY HEDGE FUNDS, WHO MAKE THE PRICE FALL DOWN BY MEANS OF SHORT LADDER ATTACKS, FALSE INFORMATION SPREAD (LIKE THE ARTICLE FROM CNBC ABOUT SILVER THAT CAUSED THE CONFUSION) AND ROBINHOOD RESTRICTIONS ALSO CAUSED DEMAND BE BE RESTRICTED AND CAUSED PANIC  SELLING AND MARGIN CALLS.IN BASIC TERMS THEY(hedge funds) SHOW US THAT THE PRICE IS FALLING BUT THEY TRYNNA FUCK WITH OUR HEAD, AND WE WONT LET THEM. WE HOLD, AND WE BUY WHEN THEY MAKE THE PRICE LOWER(ARTIFICIALLY).THAT WAYS EVENTUALLY THEYLL BE OUT OF MONEY (BECAUSE IT TAKES MONEY FOR ALL OF THE SHORT LADDER ATTACKS), AND THEY CANT DO IT FOREVER.EVENTUALLY WHEN THEIR SHORT CONTRACTS WILL BE OVER THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY AND HIGHER PRICES. AND THEN THEY LOSE BIG.BIG BIG DOLLARS.AND WE GAIN GAIN GAIM LIKE ANYTHING. THIS IS LITERALLY GOING TO BE LIKE 2008 WHEN VOLKSWAGEN WAS VALUED AT ABOUT 1000 A SHARE. THE GRAPHS LOOK VERY SIMILAR.

Bankers and politicians after making the american dollar fiat and removing it from the gold standard needed to keep the metal cheap to accumulate. They knew old folks wouldn't sell, so they waited for them to die, kept the silent generation's children poor, addicted to drugs, what have you, and set up "Cash 4 Gold." They've been accumulating for decades. Now the demand for Silver is has risen due to industrial technology. It takes a lot of silver to make solar panels and batteries. Once the Green New Deal passes, and it will, they don't want the price of silver to be $25 an ounce.

GE is profitable for first time in 3 yrs and has CASHFLOW after divesting non profitable sectors. THIS THIS This is how i plan on making up for some of my stonks losses which i held on to one too many days longer. I am looking for $15 GE in Q2/Q3, and potentially reaching 20 by Year End before my leaps expire. This is currently my 2nd biggest position next to Moderna. These GE option Calls for $12  $15  $20 strikenpeices are between 50 cents to $1.50 between June and Jan 2022 (Strike Prices: $12, $15, $20). Potentially Triple Bagger if GE continues their new profitable trend and increase revenue and cashflow quarter by quarter 🥵🚀🚀 CEO Lawrence Culp Jr. Has brought back GE from the grave in 2018 and now they are alive and kicking furiously.|2021-02-03 11:03:03

lvpoer|lbl62i|lbl62i|-11|# You know,  \*\*hits blunt\*\*If you think about it, GameStop might be a good **LOOOOOOONG** term investment.  *\*hits blunt again\**  Here's my thesis:  In 50-100 years when most people will be receiving their month stimmy check from the new globalist world order that eventually takes over, most people wont be working anymore, cause you know, robots, so people will need to find things to do. Since working will be limited, most people will be strapped into their 24/7 VR chair and uploaded onto a VR type lifestyle. It's pretty much like that movie Surrogates, with B dawg willy, but with VR.  Sounds crazy right?  Lemme spell it out for you  >!G A M E S T O P    V R   B A B Y!<  HOLD YOUR STOCKS TILL YOUR 75 THEN CASH IN ON ALL THAT SWEET SWEET VR MONEY.  Worst case scenario you can't actually spend that stock money on the company anymore and they end up giving you in-game VR tokens or some shit for it.

lvjz4i|lbl62i|lbl62i|-26|Silver protects you from the blood sucking Vampires on Wall Street! Traditionally in history silver is used to kill vampires & werewolves lol.  Buy physical silver and it will expose the fake silver manipulated derivative paper contracts markets because there's not enough physical to cover those iou silver paper contracts.  Physical silver is sold out everywhere! Even when market price of silver pulled back now. This exposure will lead to 2 main silver markets, one is the physical market and the other is the fake derivative market that is worthless with a huge price difference between the both markets that will show the world the manipulation in silver.  Physical Silver is the only affordable real insurance we small retail investors can fall back on once the dollar crashes.  Gold & silver has been in the markets for 1000s of years and still will be. I don't think anyone can say Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Google and such will still be here in a 1000 years lol.

lvtpt3|lbl62i|lbl62i|-12|Just a lurker that decided to pitch in. I'm a fan of Alex Jones and what I learned there recently made a lot of sense to me. I just graduated in Financial Economics and there's a big argument happening still between libertarian and socialist/establishmentarian economists. It's all about how the government should intervene in the economy, of course. I had a couple of professors that were good friends but were on opposite sides of this spectrum. In fact, one was a state legislator that founded a small institution just off-campus where conservatives could meet and discuss the news and such while the other used to work for the federal reserve in California. One of their regular disputes was about inflation and basically, although the federal reserve has been inflating so much money into the economy we could not see the results of that inflation. It didn't make sense to me that the dollar would strengthen at all especially during a pandemic but I recently found out that paper money that's supposedly backed by silver was being sold by big banks. This can easily be used for inflation and apparently since some time ago, Alex has been mentioning silver being devalued into oblivion when its intrinsic value sits at around $5000 because of current supply and demand for silver in the market. I haven't seen any real evidence for this but the talking points make a lot of sense. They devalue gold as well as silver by selling paper that's supposedly backed by these metals but that's no different than fractional reserve banking. They assume that no more than a certain percentage of investors would cash in that paper for silver so if they did, there would be a run on the banks that were selling those notes which would force the whole scam wide open. This might wake people up to the fact that the dollar has been inflated a lot allowing regular investors to convert dollars into other currencies, precious metals, and even cryptocurrencies before the federal reserve stops dumping money into these companies, inflating the value of their stocks like what's happened to GME, and these same hedge funds make more money they every made in the market through what these people are calling the "Great Reset" or the "Big Green." It shouldn't take too many people out there to buy some calls, whatever you feel comfortable with, buy $100 or more in SLV for the stock to hike up significantly and then use the money to buy the paper silver and demand payment. I could be confusing the process, I'm not familiar with buying metals and don't even know where to go to buy that paper silver. I thought I'd give my take on it because it wouldn't require any crazy investing if everyone just pitched in a little and helped each other to go through the whole process. The endgame is to attack JP Morgan and the other big banks involved in this mess and to possibly wake people up to what they're planning to do to everyone's savings via the great reset. I'm certain that the goal of the "Big Green" is not to make money as much as it is to make everyone else besides those authoritarians as poor as possible.|2021-02-03 11:27:46

After talking/interviewing them for a few minutes he asks to see those feet. Then he might ask to smell them(some even let him lick their feet in public lol). What could go wrong if I did this? Legally speaking I see nothing wrong. I would enjoy smelling some girlFoot. ITS NOT FAIR😭!...
