dra1q8|k1zap5|k1zap5|81|I’m excited there’s so much hype and institutional buying lately on PLTR and it’s only been trading for 2 months. Could be a 10x and it’s only 3x so far. I’m taking a shit so excuse my math but I think around $65 makes PLTR a $100 billion market cap. I really think that’s where it’s heading and a good chance that happens before the lock up period ends. Then I see Peter Thiel (the gay lover of my dreams) announcing an extension on the lock up causing the stock to soar even more. Next comes news about all the new government contracts and it goes fucking mental again. Then my sexy ass verse top says they need to do a stock split. By this point everyone who shorted the company is homeless but we rich PLTR holders donate to food drives and shelters to help them out.   TLDR: I’m averaging up on PLTR.|2020-11-27 05:43:20

dsalxt|k1zap5|k1zap5|26|Re PLTR  Sure, if you bought at 33 this morning expecting it to hit 40, the slide looks especially hard. But remember: this is only a half day, a slow day overall, and the stock was hit with an unusually aggressive hit piece.  Monday, there's a strong likelihood of a rally as people look at the price and realize it's a great buying opportunity.|2020-11-27 11:59:24

I think im gonna move to Portland. get an apartment and try and do the college thing over again (i dropped out while working full time at 18). I've always admired folks who got Computer Science degree's because of the professional and monetary freedom that it brings (you'll always have a six figure job if you want it).  you guys think that's a good idea in a year? hold onto most of my shares and just trim here and there for rent and school/life stuff?

I just got done selling 2 12/18 25p and 2 20p contracts, and if it’s down next week I’ll average more puts if needed.

dsfdki|k1zap5|k1zap5|9|I had an epiphany when I was on shrooms at the ripe old age of 16: shit is either spiraling up, or spiraling down. This is as true for stocks as it is for any other aspect of your life.   All the meme stocks go up cuz they go up cuz they go up, etc...  GME has a spiral magnifier in the form of a massive short interest. The autists have already bought in. Now it has come time for the retard grunts such as you and I to pile the fuck in and take this bitch to the moon.   Now is out chance to work together and show those thickskulled MM’s who really controls the market now.   Buy stock and set an absurd limit sell order to take your stake out of the pool of shortable stock.   Take this and make the memes—create the vessel that will carry this sub to the moon as our forfathers have done before us.

drri9g|k1zap5|k1zap5|5|This tech market is so fucking hard right now - it's literally exponential growth mode - as portfolio increases in size margin increases = more shares/calls and the cycle repeats - there is literally NO limit to how high stocks like PLTR can go - it could double by next week at this rate. I'm already balls deep in it with my mortgage money - I think we will see $50 by next week and by Christmas $75-80 which will mean I can get a new fucking house|2020-11-27 09:20:49

dso82e|k1zap5|k1zap5|6|Fun fact you already probably know:   When your account hits 4 day trades (under 25k) you can still day trade several more times that day, in fact I dont know what the limit is but it's way higher than 4 trades. Once you hit 4 you're already PDT fucked so go ham if you arent garbage at day trading. You cant open new positions until you reset your PDT, which can occur every 90 days.  For literally years I thought that 4 day trades in a week meant you're just permabanned from day trading and that's it.   I got first time PDT this week and realized that you got one shot every three months to ignore the day trading limit fucking yolo your heart out to reach that $25k and make the PDT rule fuck off.  That's how it is in Tastyworks at least. Also obviously doesn't apply to cash accounts|2020-11-27 13:55:34

By the way he talked in the threads, this is the exact fucking reason why people like Cramer hate our guts -- because the majority of WSB are 18-year old fart-sniffing RH-users who slam your faces onto your keyboards and yolo our entire accounts thinking we're financial geniuses.  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0xh3r/i_just_bought_this_option_and_right_after_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  You forgot the **GOLDEN FUCKING RULE** of wallstreetbets.

drnq29|k1zap5|k1zap5|2|Seeing how SBE and CIIC were doing, and given that Microvast seems legit, I got into Tuscan.   However, Im a little bit worried because I cannot sell it until late December (due to some employer rules-dont ask).   I understand now that SBE and CIIC are just a matter of a week of pumps and could go down any moment and that its the same case for Tuscan.   Im a little bit worried. It seems like after merge news come out (maybe next week), having to wait 3 weeks to be able to sell looks like an eternity.   How long do merges actually take to happen and is it true that these only pump up for a few days?|2020-11-27 08:41:17

dslpvi|k1zap5|k1zap5|3|VGAC is Virgin Galactic Acquisition Company. It's a Virgin Galactic SPAC. It's all rumors on what it will do right now, but there are a few possible outcomes.   Branson said in March that he's [interested in developing an electric car](https://www.manufacturingglobal.com/lean-manufacturing/virgin-will-compete-tesla-electric-car-business-says-richard-branson?fbclid=IwAR0ja0pFJS5mOuy7ReKZiV8Y5jg7iGKB_lmk77RrLsqWllwQZHAwnV3b4-E) that would compete with Tesla. They already have an electric Formula E car that they use and it wins podiums sometimes so they're not total shit. Anyways, a Virgin Galactic electric car will obviously have limitless meme potential.   Another potential is [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/), a company developing self driving AI designed for Europe's more complicated roads. Branson recently [invested in them](https://world-news-monitor.com/technology/2020/11/23/driverless-car-start-up-wayve-gets-richard-bransons-backing-as-it-targets-us-rivals/) and could be taking this further. Or throw that in with an EV company and [baby you got a stew going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y)  Another option is [Virgin Hyperloop One](https://virginhyperloop.com/), which just had their [first successful test a few weeks ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w2lo5h3D5E). Getting a nice cash infusion to boost the company wouldn't be half bad for Branson's profits.  Other possible scenarios would be him using the funds to give extra cash to Virgin Orbit or Virgin Galactic.  If you like gambling then this is it boys. Literally could go towards anything.|2020-11-27 13:32:28

dsd2or|k1zap5|k1zap5|2|I opened a new Tastyworks brokerage account on Monday and deposited a couple thousand and ended the week up +24% except I also got PDT on Wednesday. I was pissed. I didnt know that when you hit 3 day trades you can literally trade unlimited day trades for that day only so I went kinda ham and ended Wednesday with several day trades. Visa calls I bought on Wednesday expiring Friday was so retarded because I didnt know Thursday was closed and there were limited hours today so I overpaid for OTM FDs and sold those for -76% loss today. Also lost $700 day trading futures this week, but in RH I picked up 400 shares of GME at open for a bit over $6000 and sold OTM covered calls for $760 premium.  I didnt realize their earnings is coming up and I think playing $6k in GME earnings is kinda retarded as fuck but I'm probably gonna do it|2020-11-27 12:17:26

drzsvv|k1zap5|k1zap5|2|lol I’ve seen this classic pump and dump on so many stocks on here it honestly never gets old reading the “totally not fake, definitely legal” after a stock tanks 30% from a 2-3 day run and everyone loses their asses. plantir is not tesla, and any future revenue from the Biden admin is pure speculation as far as growth and profitability. There are already 10s of billions of dollars of growth baked into this at $30. You guys are acting like the cia is cancelled and plantir is just going to take over lol.|2020-11-27 10:38:24

dslq8i|k1zap5|k1zap5|2|Alright, help me out here:  Comparing 2 defense contractor companies:  2020 Revenue Estimate2020 Operating Income  EstimateMarket Cap :-:-:-:- Northrop Grumman (NOC) 35.85 Billion\~4.08 Billion51.02 Billion Palantir (PLTR)1.07 Billion0.133 Billion51.94 Billion  &#x200B;  Palantir has a slightly bigger market cap valuation now despite its revenues being only 3% and operating income being only 3.3% of that of NG.  If your thesis is that Palantir will be "as big as NG is today in X years" (5, 10, 15 years or whatever), then what the fuck are you doing paying that far in advance for an uncertain outcome when you can buy NG who is earning that much right now?  If your thesis is that Palantir will be bigger than NG in the not-so-distant future, then show me your damn thesis and math of how that works out.  Palantir will need to grow its annual operating income by 30 times in the years to come to be making what NG is making today.|2020-11-27 13:32:33

drhcvj|k1zap5|k1zap5|0|With all this hype about EVs, I just put 2k eur on $MBTN. They claim to have an innovative technology for producing solar cells and are based in Switzerland, as well as having locations around the world. It already went up quite a bit over the last couple of months. Maybe it goes back to its 1.40€ territory. Who knows. Anyone having any opinions on this?  From their webpage: "  MORE SOLAR POWER FOR ALL WITH HIGH EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY  As a leading solar energy company, Meyer Burger is committed to this goal. At its modern sites in Freiberg (Saxony) and Bitterfeld-Wolfen (Saxony-Anhalt), the company will manufacture high-quality solar cells and modules "Made in Europe" from 2021. These are equipped with the proprietary heterojunction/smart-wire technology, which guarantees the highest efficiency at economic costs. The product range includes innovative and highly efficient solar modules for roof systems in the private and commercial sector as well as solutions for the solar power plant segment.  In addition, Meyer Burger, as a recognised technology company, supplies production equipment for standard solar cells with PERC technology.  Meyer Burger is a Swiss company with additional locations in Germany, Asia and North America."  Edit: dumb as I am I'm playing it safe and bough the stock...|2020-11-27 07:27:10

ds8adv|k1zap5|k1zap5|-15|An amateur’s opinion on Citron and PLTR, with a brief argument for NIO (since Left tried to fuck that up too):   It’ll prob fall to $20 lol, it’s not like you retards have control over anything; big money decides it all in the end, and at this point, there’s nothing supporting the rise other than dumb hype.  I will say for NIO tho, there are good things going for it like recent government policies (China is polluted to shit too), and it’s a bit easier to understand why it’ll continue to boom.   Anyways, y’all decide what you want to believe.  Edit: downvoting me because I’m right and you’re gonna lose all your money? Good luck. I’m out bb|2020-11-27 11:42:14

dra9k7|k1zap5|k1zap5|-14|Black Friday is way more dead than I've seen it in the 15 years I've been going out for it.  The market is going down.  Edit- stay at home incels downvoting this shit, both online and in store buying has been increasing every year for the last decade.  This year it's totally different and the data for this season will show this.  The best deals has always been in store door busters and people aren't hitting those up.  I live in TN where the majority of people don't give a fuck about a mask or the virus so that's not why it's dead.  But live in your bubble behind your computer.|2020-11-27 05:47:04
