hi622r|f38dq2|f38dq2|9|Alright guys, here me out.  &#x200B;  ADOBE  &#x200B;  Earnings are in one month. The stock has been rock solid the last 6 months. You couldn't get a more perfect looking trend line if you tried. This thing seems like its a tank, but I could see a good run-up to earnings. Premiums are not even that much either.  An ATM call for 3/20 only needs a 4.1% increase in the next month, meanwhile it has averaged 9%/mo the last three months without an earnings stimulus. I also saw a guy on here awhile back who worked for Adobe expressing quite a bit of confidence in their stuff. SaaS? I am in. Once I get my Schwab brokerage set up, I am going to put the chips on the table for this sob.

The trend is remarkable because in recent years, options on exchange-traded funds and indexes have grown in popularity. The firm said that a handful of stocks have spurred interest in trading. Those include Tesla, Amazon(AMZN), Apple(AAPL), Alphabet, Microsoft(MSFT), Walt Disney(DIS) and International Business Machines(IBM).

As a beginner, I like to play safe...I look for premiums that offer anywhere from 1.00-2.00 to stay modest.   Can anyone recommend me stocks that have some pretty juicy option chains?   So far, my current favorites have been COF, C, and MSFT. I'm able to play $5-$10 lower than the going price and pocket a decent amount of premium albeit I play 2-3 months out.|2020-02-13 10:58:54
