hh4hyz|f38dq2|f38dq2|20|I have a family friend that owns a giant dessert chain in China. Most of the stores are still closed atm. But apparently the Chinese government announced that they are going to use some of the money that the riches has banked to help stabilize the economy. This leads to my family friend trying to move huge funds outside of the country atm, and he’s not the only one. Idk where it’s gonna go but I just wanted to share.

You couldn't get a more perfect looking trend line if you tried. This thing seems like its a tank, but I could see a good run-up to earnings. Premiums are not even that much either.  An ATM call for 3/20 only needs a 4.1% increase in the next month, meanwhile it has averaged 9%/mo the last three months without an earnings stimulus. I also saw a guy on here awhile back who worked for Adobe expressing quite a bit of confidence in their stuff. SaaS? I am in.

The trend is remarkable because in recent years, options on exchange-traded funds and indexes have grown in popularity. The firm said that a handful of stocks have spurred interest in trading. Those include Tesla, Amazon(AMZN), Apple(AAPL), Alphabet, Microsoft(MSFT), Walt Disney(DIS) and International Business Machines(IBM). Bullish call option buying has made up a big chunk of activity, a sign that investors are eyeing bigger gains in some of these tech heavyweights.  Keep. Buying. Calls.|2020-02-13 09:54:37
