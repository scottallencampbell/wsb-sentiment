The only notable things he has said is:  1) He doesn't think there will be a recession soon.  2) Central banks around the world are running out of slack on rates to cut that they can use if a recession were to occur so banks need to use a number of tools to substitute that (i.e. QE).  3) Unemployment is fine and inflation is near 2% and he sees the American economy doing well despite the headwinds from trade issues and geopolitical issues  Personally, if I'm reading between the lines, that sounds like he doesn't think rates need to be cut, but I know the market is stupid af so calls would probably be the better move.|2019-09-06 12:29:15

za1pbw|d0f68m|d0f68m|5|Ok I will admit that I was wrong about Zillow. It turns out they are not really flipping houses as I said earlier.   They basically say that they will buy your house at the market price minus fixes and repairs. Let's say your house is worth $450k. First they lure you in with an offer for $450k minus fixes and repairs. Then you think it can't be too bad. Then they send a bunch of inspectors to your house and find as many faults as they possibly can. Then they say it will cost $50k to fix your house so their offer is reduced to $400k.   Of course they are trying to give you a lowball offer so that they can put the house in the market for $450k and make the difference as profits.  Crooked as fuck.|2019-09-06 13:11:03

za800o|d0f68m|d0f68m|4|In April-May of 2012 a JPMorgan derivatives trader named Bruno Iksil racked up a trading loss of *$9 billion USD*  betting on bond yields to fall. He first bought insurance on said  bonds, which would pay him out in the event of the bonds yield falling.  The global economy starts improving and Iksil’s position is deep  underwater. Then he tries to hedge his position by *selling*  insurance on separate set of bonds, in which he would limit his losses  from the first trade should the economy continue improving. It didn’t  and the second trade soon went against him. Lastly, attempting to get  back to even from the first two trades, he then tried to buy insurance  on a third set of bonds. That’s when JPM cut him off resulting in the  largest singlehanded trading loss (by betting on the economy) in  economic history.|2019-09-06 14:00:39

Because Robinhood is such a shitshow, they've accidentally reversed my funding of the account TWICE. However, they let me buy a 297p yesterday before they reversed the transfers.  Now I'm sitting in a position I technically never bought, but Robinhood is on the hook for. I've funded the account again, for the third time, but that shit won't clear until a week from today.

z9gz2s|d0f68m|d0f68m|8|J Pow will be giving his speech in a WWE ring. His entrance music will decide the outcome of his speech. We discussed these possibilities last night on the "Moves Tomorrow" thread. Let me go over this predictive matrix one more time for those who might need to use it to make day trades timed on JPow's speech.  Here are the possible J Pow entrance songs and their associated outcomes:  * ["Touch The Sky" by Kanye West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfPnhEqbmAE) - J Pow gives a vague speech describing the economy and says nothing meaningful. The market randomly decides to take it as hinting rate cuts and bulls win. * ["Funky Fanfare" by Keith Mansfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i6Cpq8XBFw) - Same vague speech describing the economy, but this time the spirit of the market sides with Theta Gang so that they can all buy their 6th Lambos this year. * ["Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling S🅱️ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgnClrx8N2k) - J Pow inserts Trump insults in his vague speech and is doing insider trading behind the scenes. Bear gang wins. * ["Power" by Kanye West](https://youtu.be/k8JflBNovLE) - J Pow levitates onto the stage with his eyes glowing red and announces a rate increase. * ["Diamonds From Sierra Leone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REzJJACXHrs) by 🅱️ull god Yeezy again - J Pow comes out, raps a bit, and announces a 1% rate cut to, in his words, "just totally fuck China." They play ["Celebration"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZjlP-N7Hl4) on CNBC after and Kevin O'Leary can pop a bottle with Cramer and some strippers on live TV while SPY shoots towards 420|2019-09-06 10:00:45

Is it smart to keep playing it conservatively and miss out on possible bigger gains? I usually let them ride and get burned but it’s always a punch in the gut to know you could have gotten more. So... conservatively or keep chasing the gains and potentially blowing out my account on the chase to 500-1000%? I cashed out on the calls at 100% btw.|2019-09-06 09:09:48

SPY TO 310!  ### The Bright Side for the Markets of Lower Job Creation  With investors paying close attention to prospects for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, job creation missing expectations in August could be seen as good news in the markets.  “I think it’s doubly positive for the markets...in that it will continue to strengthen the case for the Fed to cut rates while also it’s likely to keep Trump and the administration at bay a little bit as it relates to rising trade escalations, due to the softness in the report,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.  Investors will be watching closely to see what Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says about the future path of rates when he speaks in Zurich later today, he said.  Mr. Arone also pointed to underlying strength in the report, such as the unemployment rate remaining at a longtime low, average hourly earnings rising and the labor-force participation rate picking up.|2019-09-06 08:27:21

Nope, Jerome ultimately works for the guys who hold all our money and wealth today and for the next few decades. The guy sitting in the oval office is just a temp employee with a bunch of crazy ideas, who will be replaced sooner than later. Politicis, to big money, is just this madness of the crowds, this horrible experiment in slob rule that hurts them more often than it helps them.  Money is what needs to be protected not whatever joker can win a national election by saying the right things to idiots.  This is humiliating for Trump who has decided to brand himself as a self-styled strongman. Jpow is doing his own thing and ignoring Trump entirely. Of course we don't need cuts and losing the ability to cut when recession hits would be insane.
