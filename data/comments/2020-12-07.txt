exl5jo|k8el96|k8el96|100|You toss and turn as Elon gently rubs your shoulders. "You seem a little tense" says Elon, as you look at your bank account. Your phone shows $107 left to your name. You think to yourself while Elon rubs you down, you pull open Robin Hood, type in TSLA. Leaps $900 JAN 2023' are only $1 you can afford 1 leap. This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be. He says "U, for 'you'" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.       All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, "we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase  options with a $25,000 barrier to entry."    You start weeping aloud,  you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, "what's wrong my little X'√π3?"       Suddenly you wake, you're in a pool of sweat, at first you panic about the new options policy, then you're filled with relief realizing that options aren't restricted it was all a dream.       You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200,000% gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $900 and realize the options are actually $20 each. The best you can do is $900 TSLA weekly expiring around Christmas.    In a slight fit of despair you try to remember the feeling of Elon rubbing your cheek, and rub one out onto your stomach, then roll over back to sleep. A single tear rolls from your eye into your waifu pillow.       ^^^YOLO ^^you ^whisper.|2020-12-07 05:23:07

The time: July 1969. The Russians had made a mockery of us. First sputnik, then the luna 2 probe. We were on the ropes, but did America back down? NO. We stood our ground, YOLO'd our taxpayer money into a space (SPCE) program and we planted our flag in the moon. THE MOON! 🚀🚀🚀🚀  Now is our time.   We might have our backs against the ropes. We might have made a couple bucks off of PLTR only to lose them the last couple days. But our Fight is not over. And just like the USA, its time again, to YOLO our accounts into SPCE. Let's see it break 40 lets see it go to the moon. Will you join me? You could be the next Neil Armstrong. The next Buzz Aldrin.

The stocks that people hone in on here are , such as FB, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA, and other fang stocks, have proven to be huge winners out of a pool of thousands of companies to choose from.

ezarlp|k8el96|k8el96|11|I'm going to start off by saying yes, I'm salty I've missed out on Tesla tendies. I had calls before S&P inclusion that I sold way too early and missed out on tons of gains and since then I've held off buying back in to my chagrin.  But the truth of the matter is these Tesla gains are completely unjustifiable and have been since the beginning of this year. I would bet money that Elon himself thinks the same thing and laughs everyday seeing his net worth balloon up billions of dollars because even he knows he's in the middle of Tulipmania 2.0. Don't get me wrong, I love Tesla as a company and I'm convinced it will innovate well into the future but anyone who is convinced that this is the new paradigm or that these gains will continue indefinitely is absolutely deluded. I'm happy for every wageslave making thousands if not millions off Tesla just don't get caught with your pants down when the inevitable pullback comes because when it does it will spare no one. Don't get lost in the mania of making so much money, remember to take some profits and stay vigilant especially as the S&P inclusion date gets nearer.|2020-12-07 14:19:44

ez8h9n|k8el96|k8el96|3| My fellow investors,   It is with grave concern that I write this to you all. I have fundamental concerns with the actions of some individuals in this group with regards to the "rocket ship" emoji. The "rocket ship" should ONLY be utilized when symbols increase so significantly, that one could argue the stock has gone to, or is on the way to ‘the moon.’  I think we can all agree that a 6% increase in these times is about the equivalent distance of the height of a small child’s bounce on a trampoline to the ground. This does not warrant usage of the "rocket ship ".|2020-12-07 14:02:13

ezaqw6|k8el96|k8el96|3|As a Tsla bull, I actually don’t have issues with people taking a contrarian approach and buying puts. What I don’t understand is why would some folks, retail and institutional investors, short the stock, as in borrow shares in stead of buying puts?!? The max loss of a buy to open put is the premium paid, whereas the max loss on a short position from borrowed shares could easily exceed 100% and is theoretically infinity. Also brokerages charge 💰for the borrowed shares.  Anyhow, my wagyu is done, thanks Elon. Tsla 800 by EOY.|2020-12-07 14:19:35

That's a measly $28/day. There are hobos on street corners making more than that.  Big wins are nice, but if your daily average on the year is inconsistent it ends up being unimpressive.  With 253 trading days in a year,  $200/day = $50.6k/yr  $300/day = $75.9k/yr  $400/day = $101.2k/yr  My goal for 2021 is a daily average of $200-400.|2020-12-07 10:38:38

ey62jt|k8el96|k8el96|2|March 2021 SLV calls for Janet confirmation. She’s Keynesian as fuck and that will rain tendies on clang gang.  1/15/21 NIO calls for NIO day, they claim to be already in compliance with the new US law, and they have a 3 year window to get there if they aren’t. Will probably sell the day before the event and roll into leaps on the (likely) dip the day after.   I’m HELLA hesitant of meme stocks, I usually go in, make some gains, and get out just to lock in profits, but that NIO dip was way too juicy not to ride for a month now. Short of a market collapse they’re set to run back up and the break even pricing is still well below their yearly high, which they will hit again.|2020-12-07 09:32:20

The old guard, the gray hairs of the market, standing aside, their mouths agape, whisperings amongst themselves, "where does it end? it has to end. will it end?"|2020-12-07 10:34:23

eyokt9|k8el96|k8el96|4|Hey guys remember when I gave you DD on CCJ? Go look at them now. Remember when I hyped up Under Armour b4 earnings and said it was way beaten down but tons of people are working out and buying new gear? Yeah, its up like 30% since.  Im always hyping up SE and AMD, both hit all time highs last week. PFE, that was my vaccine play since Spring. I bought Palantir at IPO the first second markets opened.  Im telling you guys, 🍄, APHA, and BB will be the ones youll be kicking yourself for not getting into.  Go look at APHAs financials. Their revenue blows similar market cap weed stocks away. They purchased Sweetwater Brewing which opens them up to a huge US market (sweetwater does 66 mil revenue per quarter and has large musuc festivals) and more and more states and countries are legaluzing weed regardless of what the senate thinks. Just getting to that vote is a huge milestone in favor of weed. Your state will realize its people are going to a neighboring state to give them money and your state will realize they are missing out on tons of free money.  BB...this isnt a FD play, this is something thatll payoff in time if you are patient.  In fact, none of my plays are FDs. The only time Id consider it is if its like  a Wednesday and I see Fri 100c AMD for like 5 cents.|2020-12-07 11:51:58

exsl70|k8el96|k8el96|2|I can tell you when I think of different bull and bear scenarios the one that seems to always come out on top is that the FED is working with Big tech/Top Vaccine companies, Biden, top hedge funds and (on a deeper note heads of really damged companies are in constant talks with hedge funds on when they drop bad news) + Fed buying and them Equity trapping everyone  to float the bad days  to less bad days by random stimulus talks  + vaccine data/drop days  Really think Biden has already been weponizing his news drops to help the fed out imo  My guess is that market will go down slightly down till PFE finally gets approved then we get a nice rally that last even long than people expect than we return to reality that only essentails got vaccine then it might kangarooo till the fed plays with moderna getting approved then we float till a second (earlier dump of more doses get distrubited/plus better than expected decembe) floats us to BIDEn getting sworn in and we get a rally around that we just keep floating/hovering till each vaccine doses drop/biden move.  if that makes sense to anyone keep track of this.

eymi6e|k8el96|k8el96|1|So when comparing the USD to a currency from a country who handled covid well and didnt have to print much money like the Taiwan Dollar, it’s clear the USD is only worth 93% of what it was in mid-March. That means, net of currency devaluation we’re officially back above ATH’s ($364 is the adjusted previous ATH). However, this doesn’t take into consideration the fact that a weakened dollar would lead to more investment inflows to the US. We may be reaching short-term peak relatively soon. But until then, PLTR time baby!!!!|2020-12-07 11:38:26

exnhif|k8el96|k8el96|-3|If someone has set up an algorithm bot for trading then please do share...   It could be the paranoia getting the better of me... Every time I trade stocks that are predominantly institutional owned, it correlates perfectly with S&P... until... Until it gets to resistance or support. When it hits resistance and s&p takes off. You'd think it would also... Wrong. It seems as though the institutional fucks wait to see a marked drop from other investors then immediatley buy up shares and make more gains.. If other investors don't sell, I have seen them short it back down to next support line, creating a selloff from individuals who think the stock is tanking despite SPY increase.   &#x200B;  Am I being paranoid? Or is Wall street out to fuck our tight little virgin stock pussies?   &#x200B;  With this I have taken a stand against trading FCEL and other stocks with majority institutional  ownership.   &#x200B;  I'm going to fomo all my account into RR.
