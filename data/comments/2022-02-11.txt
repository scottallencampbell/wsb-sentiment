I'm guessing a bunch of funds bought the dip knowing damn well this is a company going down.  AFRM starts to bounce, then all of a sudden, you see a bunch of analyst upgrades, outperform ratings, etc. To push the price.  The upward move was so crazy to watch and I'm sure retail jumped in because of this.  The price hits $83 before the rug pull, and retail is holding the bags while the funds exit.

Idk why some people are still saying this market is still greedy and needs to sell off. It did and still is selling off. If you're thinking the market is greedy based on how you feel then you're not understanding the saying "be greedy when other's are fearful". People are fearful (selling fucking everything) right now. You're just conditioned to always be greedy.  When shit is sky high I'm greedy and want it to go higher. When shit is drilling I'm greedy and am thinking of my future gains from the current price. That doesn't mean the market is greedy right now. We're just insatiable greedy fucks.|2022-02-11 13:53:24

wja1wr|spwu0v|spwu0v|19|Wow, this is looking like the boom of 1973.  Jobs were plentiful.  Earnings were up strongly.  GDP was up by over 5%.  The market was at record highs.  Inflation was rising.    Then came 1974, the impacts of the Fed's interest rate hikes were starting to be felt.  Stock markets began to lose their breadth just like now where everything is only propped up by MSFT/AAPL/GOOGL/AMZN.  Week after week the markets sold off.  Sure, there were lots of rallies.  There were 17 rallies from Jan 1974 to Sept 1974, to be exact.  But each high was lower than the preceding high.  And each low was lower than the preceding low.  By the end of Sept 1974, the market was down 60% from its peak.  It takes time, and there will be a lot of articles claiming the bull market is back.  But indeed, it will be a dire downfall.  2022 is looking much like 1974.  Beware.|2022-02-11 12:15:14

wjxyfh|spwu0v|spwu0v|5|How or why are people paying this idiot for trading advice?  "Cramer Investing Club: Magnitude of AMD pullback even in down market seems excessive"  The reason for the AMD pullback is the XLNX merger going through on Monday.  Algos are frontrunning the all-stock merger which will add $40-50 billion shares to the float and which are mostly held by arbitrageurs or short-term traders due to the 1-2 year length of the merger process (all long-term holders typically exit stocks that get caught up in long merger reviews).  Go look at what happened to Disney-Fox merger 3 years ago, same thing happened with Disney dumping for 4-5 days as Fox holders dumped their new Disney shares.  Was predictable as hell (I've been warning any AMD holders to be careful of the XLNX merger closing).|2022-02-11 14:41:38

wjnnt2|spwu0v|spwu0v|1|IMO Russia is just trying to gain leverage for the bargaining table. The sanctions the US has put on them have really hit their economy hard. So Putin is using Ukraine in two ways.   First, he wants bargaining power. Can‚Äôt tel the US to lift sanctions when you have very little to offer in return. An invasion gives him leverage.   Secondly, he wants something to distract the Russian population. It‚Äôs a classic tactic taken by dictators to keep their citizens focused on something other than their miserable lives. It gives something for even the poorest Russians to root for and believe in. Many Russians already consider Ukraine to be their territory, so it‚Äôs an easy foe to choose for Putin.    I don‚Äôt see a long drawn out war here. I think US/Russia/Europe get to the bargaining table quickly to prevent a full scale invasion. At least I hope so.|2022-02-11 13:38:14

wiienb|spwu0v|spwu0v|2|**The numbers:** The University of Michigan‚Äôs gauge of consumer sentiment fell to an initial February reading of 61.7, from January‚Äôs level of 67.2, the lowest reading since October of 2011.        Economists were expecting a reading of 67, according to a Wall Street Journal survey.        **Key details:**  Expectations for inflation over the next year rose to 5% from January‚Äôs expectation of 4.9%, the highest level since July of 2008, while inflation expectations over five years held steady at 3.1%.        **Big picture:** With consumer prices rising at a 40-year high of 7.5% last month, Americans remain pessimistic about their buying power, as even healthy wage gains have not kept pace with the cost of living.        **What UMich said:** Richard Curtin, chief economist of the survey, called February‚Äôs decline ‚Äústunning,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúthe recent declines have been driven by weakening personal financial prospects, largely due to rising inflation, less confidence in the government‚Äôs economic policies, and the least favorable long term economic outlook in a decade.‚Äù        ‚ÄúThe impact of higher inflation on personal finances was spontaneously cited by one-third of all consumers, with nearly half of all consumers expecting declines in their inflation adjusted incomes during the year ahead,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIn addition, fewer households cited rising net household wealth since the pandemic low in May 2020, largely due to the falling likelihood of stock price increases in 2022.‚Äù|2022-02-11 09:24:02

whwwau|spwu0v|spwu0v|2|Lmao, imagine being a bull thinking rate hikes are all you gotta worry about.  QE is the biggest reason for inflation, and it is STILL going on in the background, which is truly absurd. Imagine the sound of the crash if they just turn it off.  Now imagine if they start tightening and reducing that massive $9T balance sheet back.  Bulls will be hurting sooooo bad.  The only problem is that no one can predict what the Fed will do with the balance sheet. When will it be turned off?  Will it be reduced?  How fast will it be reduced?  How long is the ramp down?  So many unknowns that can hang clouds over everything.  QE is the only reason for this bloated ass market that will not correct in a natural free market way to allow all of the weak fat to be trimmed.  Time for QT.|2022-02-11 06:38:39

wi9oz8|spwu0v|spwu0v|-5|This market is pathetic.  Bulls have been spinning their wheels since November trying to get this market back to ATH.  The fact that it has gone nowhere except down over the last 3 months is signaling deeper weakness.  MMs are manipulating the shit out of you. They rug pull and let you think you're buying the dip.  They allow a recovery to suck more of you in to trick you into thinking things are back to normal, the only problem is that they rug pull again at a lower high. Rinse and repeat over and over.  The highs for the market keep getting lower and lower after mini bull runs.  8 months later you see the bigger picture, and that's the fact that you're now 25% down, but it was too difficult to see what was going on because MMs were unloading their bags with a slow bleed out mixed in with small bull runs to blow smoke up your ass.|2022-02-11 08:24:50

wioevh|spwu0v|spwu0v|1|Thoughts on BRCC (black rifle coffee company)? They just completed the spac merger. I am from Oklahoma and have actually been inside one of their locations in OKC. It was one of the busiest coffee shops I have ever seen. And that's saying a lot, from someone who used to work for Starbucks and frequents coffee shops everywhere I go. I also noticed almost every customer walking out of the store with bags of coffee and armfuls of merchandise. This looks like the southern version of Dutch BROS except with really good marketing towards rednecks. Bullish, but looking for anyone else with more information or at least an informed opinion. They currently make most of their money by online direct to customer. I can definitely see them becoming a household name if they start expanding their physical locations across the southern US and other conservative or hillbilly states like Tennessee, Kentucky, lol.        I sold a single put today at the 12.5 strike Mar 18 expiry.        I know messing around with spac's is often like touching your pp on a hot stove.. but this one seems legit and promising, especially considering I have firsthand information as a customer.|2022-02-11 10:02:41

wjn8su|spwu0v|spwu0v|1|i am still testing the waters in my short calls. what is your strategy in selling short calls? my strategy is to sell to open during green day, then close when its 50%. so far so good. I seldom roll my calls because the moment i buy to close, its usually a red day and when I rollover that short call to a new one, I will get small premium. I wait for like 1-3 days then if its green day, I sell to open again, and wait for my target of 50%? I feel like, the only reason for me to roll my calls is when it gets breached near my expiration? Please let me know what do you think?|2022-02-11 13:35:42
