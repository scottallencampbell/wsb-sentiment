x7wbvq|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|22|Let me explain it to you guys 1 more time.  It SUCKS ASS dragging your little kids to Walmart to buy groceries.  Grocery pickup was already huge for WMT.    Now you don't even have to load the kids up in the minivan. You just order and it shows up at your house.    I get it, most of you are 20 and have no kids.  But many of us are in the suburbs with kids and going to WMT is a pain in the ass. However, WMT has great variety and prices.   This is why this is a big deal.  People already pay $100 a year for AMZN so they can get cheap garbage delieved to their house that isn't even always very essential.   AMZN can't compete on the grocery and everyday goods things like this with WMT in most markets.  People in bumfuck Alambama small town can now get groceries delievered to their house in a day from WMT. AMZN can't do that.|2020-07-07 11:32:38

x7itc0|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|39|Alright bros, I turned 10k to ~25k, then took a 2 month break, came back last week and turned my 1k instant deposit to 12k and I‚Äôm out again. Closed everything at open today, didn‚Äôt sell TSLA at the top but close enough.  https://i.imgur.com/i5fXEHj.jpg  Whenever I trade, it takes up my entire headspace and I can‚Äôt really do anything else like focus on exercise or learning new things. I look at lines going up and down all day and then look at futures all night. If I come back to WSB, I‚Äôll probably FOMO myself into some other trade. I also know it‚Äôs pretty easy to lose it all through overtrading. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs good to see portfolio going up but there are more important things in life and I don‚Äôt wanna feel like I‚Äôm throwing my potential away. I can‚Äôt deal with trading anymore, it‚Äôs counterproductive to my grand vision for myself. I‚Äôve seen myself make and lose my monthly salary in seconds so I feel like I need to step away and take a moment to readjust my thinking again. As my example proves, it‚Äôs possible to take long breaks then return whenever you feel like it and make $$$.  So I‚Äôm taking a break again, from trading and probably from WSB too, don‚Äôt know for how long. I made my trades last week based on solid DD and now it just feels like gambling, which I don‚Äôt wanna partake in. Thank you all for everything and see you later.|2020-07-07 09:38:48

This individual had special and particular skills/background that made him suitable for a company like the big P. They made him an offer for a lot of money. Still unknown at the time, both he and the company were shocked.  Nonetheless, he forwent the salary, and opted for options and shares despite the value being ‚Äúconsiderably less.‚Äù To make up for it, they gave him a big options/stock package.   Fast forward: this man is probably about to generate a 100000% return or more once they IPO.   TLDR: from poor villager with nothing to probably worth north of 150-300 mil by this time next year.|2020-07-07 06:44:40

x7ltnx|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|5|>Alternative data suggests that the **resurgence of the virus in recent weeks has had only marginal impact, if any, on the recovery of consumer spending and the labor market.** That perhaps explains the resilience of riskier assets and will continue to support them. For instance, the latest data from the Harvard-based research group Opportunity Insights showed consumer spending was only down 7.4% as of June 24, from the January level, compared with a decline of 12% at the beginning of June. (H/T to Gavyn Davies at Fulcrum Asset Management, who recently used the data to analyse the labor market.) Opportunity Insights, which has attracted much attention with a detailed analysis on granular spending patterns down to zip codes, also showed job postings had already recovered to the January level by late June. The message is consistent with Apple‚Äôs mobility data. Data from Homebase, a scheduling software company, also showed the recovery in the job market continues, albeit gradually. Other alternative data are less encouraging, though. JPMorgan‚Äôs credit/debit card spending showed tentative signs of slowing at the end of June, while OpenTable data suggested that the recovery in restaurant dining has stalled since mid-June.|2020-07-07 10:05:18

x8aci6|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|4|>Two Tesla bears are capitulating on Tesla stock -- sort of.  > Barclays analyst Brian Johnson and Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas both rate Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) at the equivalent of Sell. But both have some positive things to say about the company in Tuesday research reports. Still, neither one upgraded the stock, or did much to their target prices for Tesla shares.  > Jonas raised his bull-case target price for Tesla stock rose to $2,070 from $1,200, a big 73% bump. His base target price moved less, however, by just 14%, to $740 from $650. For the near term, Jonas increased his 2020 delivery estimate to 475,000 vehicles from **420,000** vehicles to account for his official price target raise.   Imagine not revising from 420,000 to 420,069. Asshat.|2020-07-07 13:23:11

"Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy.

Honestly, so many middle class families are going to love this because you can avoid going to Walmart altogether, yet still get the essentials needed at good prices.  There just aren't many options like Walmart out there.  AMZN can't compete with the grocery side at this point, and to be able to order groceries + stuff like shampoo etc and get it delivered to your door at a cheap price is huge.|2020-07-07 11:23:22

x7pu8v|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|5|So here is the logic behind Tesla. If you are not a car enthusiast you want people driving a tesla. Whether you are conservative or liberal gas engines emit toxic particulates that you breathe in. Nobody is gonna stop anyone from getting a lambo but grandma in the corolla who doesnt care about cars should be rockin an EV. Tesla is best positioned to make it happen. Thats it. The more ability they have to fund EV adoption and growth the better our chances are at seeing it become the standard. The price doesnt matter as long as they can reach their market cap in the next 20 years. We are just accelerating the pace because the faster they win the faster we benefit. Its just Apple without waiting 20 years. Lets get this shit done today.|2020-07-07 10:39:27

x84nce|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|1|##Potential Plays for Coming Weeks  - as the government announced ‚Äúbailout‚Äù loans to airlines, and all airlines are seemingly laying off staff, I believe the delta earnings will be a shit show. So, I would consider OTHER airlines to play around the earnings. Everyone will use delta earnings as a proxy for rest of industry.   - flipside, if delta is strong in earnings go for other airlines still to avoid Iv crush from earnings  - I believe there is a similar play with banks. Tons of banks reporting next week. I believe Citi is one of the first. They are sitting on tons of cash.... because they aren‚Äôt lending.... the fed is lending a ton. So, without lending I believe they‚Äôll leg down. I‚Äôd recommend playing a different bank that will have earnings day or two after the other banks.   Good luck fellas|2020-07-07 12:38:28
