x7wbvq|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|22|Let me explain it to you guys 1 more time.  It SUCKS ASS dragging your little kids to Walmart to buy groceries.  Grocery pickup was already huge for WMT.    Now you don't even have to load the kids up in the minivan. You just order and it shows up at your house.    I get it, most of you are 20 and have no kids.  But many of us are in the suburbs with kids and going to WMT is a pain in the ass. However, WMT has great variety and prices.   This is why this is a big deal.  People already pay $100 a year for AMZN so they can get cheap garbage delieved to their house that isn't even always very essential.   AMZN can't compete on the grocery and everyday goods things like this with WMT in most markets.  People in bumfuck Alambama small town can now get groceries delievered to their house in a day from WMT. AMZN can't do that.|2020-07-07 11:32:38

x7itc0|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|39|Alright bros, I turned 10k to ~25k, then took a 2 month break, came back last week and turned my 1k instant deposit to 12k and I’m out again. Closed everything at open today, didn’t sell TSLA at the top but close enough.  https://i.imgur.com/i5fXEHj.jpg  Whenever I trade, it takes up my entire headspace and I can’t really do anything else like focus on exercise or learning new things. I look at lines going up and down all day and then look at futures all night. If I come back to WSB, I’ll probably FOMO myself into some other trade. I also know it’s pretty easy to lose it all through overtrading. At the end of the day, it’s good to see portfolio going up but there are more important things in life and I don’t wanna feel like I’m throwing my potential away. I can’t deal with trading anymore, it’s counterproductive to my grand vision for myself. I’ve seen myself make and lose my monthly salary in seconds so I feel like I need to step away and take a moment to readjust my thinking again. As my example proves, it’s possible to take long breaks then return whenever you feel like it and make $$$.  So I’m taking a break again, from trading and probably from WSB too, don’t know for how long. I made my trades last week based on solid DD and now it just feels like gambling, which I don’t wanna partake in. Thank you all for everything and see you later.|2020-07-07 09:38:48

Sex is better, marriage is better, **trading is way better**, skin is clearer, weight is down, depression is gone, I can pay attention and focus, the list goes on and on.  Not kidding I made 30k in March and lost it all constantly getting drunk and buying puts into April. Now that I'm back up and not drinking I kept almost all my money through the June correction.

x72qlq|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|7|In honor of their confidential ipo I’ll tell the story of the greatest trade ever made.   I know a guy who grew up in a poor village and eventually made his way to America. This individual had special and particular skills/background that made him suitable for a company like the big P. They made him an offer for a lot of money. Still unknown at the time, both he and the company were shocked.  Nonetheless, he forwent the salary, and opted for options and shares despite the value being “considerably less.” To make up for it, they gave him a big options/stock package.   Fast forward: this man is probably about to generate a 100000% return or more once they IPO.   TLDR: from poor villager with nothing to probably worth north of 150-300 mil by this time next year.|2020-07-07 06:44:40

x7ltnx|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|5|>Alternative data suggests that the **resurgence of the virus in recent weeks has had only marginal impact, if any, on the recovery of consumer spending and the labor market.** That perhaps explains the resilience of riskier assets and will continue to support them. For instance, the latest data from the Harvard-based research group Opportunity Insights showed consumer spending was only down 7.4% as of June 24, from the January level, compared with a decline of 12% at the beginning of June. (H/T to Gavyn Davies at Fulcrum Asset Management, who recently used the data to analyse the labor market.) Opportunity Insights, which has attracted much attention with a detailed analysis on granular spending patterns down to zip codes, also showed job postings had already recovered to the January level by late June. The message is consistent with Apple’s mobility data. Data from Homebase, a scheduling software company, also showed the recovery in the job market continues, albeit gradually. Other alternative data are less encouraging, though. JPMorgan’s credit/debit card spending showed tentative signs of slowing at the end of June, while OpenTable data suggested that the recovery in restaurant dining has stalled since mid-June.|2020-07-07 10:05:18

x7pjgv|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|15|September 2020  In a 13F filing, Warren Buffett reveals he purchased 25% of Tesla shares in Q3. More than Musk himself owns. Shares during this time exploded from $898 to $3,000. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett states “Get fucked, haters.” Shares of Tesla skyrocket to $10,000 a share on the news.  December 2020  Buffett reports that he steadily dumped all of his shares of Tesla in October 2020. Claims, “The valuations were whack at $1,000, let alone $10,000.” In response to Tesla’s plummeting stock price, Buffett takes to Twitter for the first time in over four years to post a selfie of himself in his Tesla short shorts with the caption “Merry Christmas, morons.”|2020-07-07 10:36:56

I bought a recommendation from CNBC and I can't regret it more.  Come on AZN tell us how your damn vaccine is doing.  HP which is my newest position sucks.  I need to buy it down.

x7275l|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|14|The year is 2058. For 38 years, SPY has vacillated between 300 and 320. As you stare off into the distance, you feel a tug at your sleeve. It's your grandson. "Grandpa, can you tell me about Bulls and Bears again?"    Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: "Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales."     You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.    The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy. A quiet rage flares behind your eyes, then fades to sadness.            ^^^Yes, ^^^I ^^^posted ^^^this ^^^before, ^^^but ^^^I’ll ^^^post ^^^it ^^^in ^^^every ^^^thread ^^^until ^^^it’s ^^^untrue.|2020-07-07 06:37:00

x7v6d2|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|4|Yes, I think this WMT news is huge.   Tons of middle class folks will use this service.  I already know how popular their grocery pickup is.  This is very big.    Honestly, so many middle class families are going to love this because you can avoid going to Walmart altogether, yet still get the essentials needed at good prices.  There just aren't many options like Walmart out there.  AMZN can't compete with the grocery side at this point, and to be able to order groceries + stuff like shampoo etc and get it delivered to your door at a cheap price is huge.|2020-07-07 11:23:22

x7pu8v|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|5|So here is the logic behind Tesla. If you are not a car enthusiast you want people driving a tesla. Whether you are conservative or liberal gas engines emit toxic particulates that you breathe in. Nobody is gonna stop anyone from getting a lambo but grandma in the corolla who doesnt care about cars should be rockin an EV. Tesla is best positioned to make it happen. Thats it. The more ability they have to fund EV adoption and growth the better our chances are at seeing it become the standard. The price doesnt matter as long as they can reach their market cap in the next 20 years. We are just accelerating the pace because the faster they win the faster we benefit. Its just Apple without waiting 20 years. Lets get this shit done today.|2020-07-07 10:39:27

x7wmpu|hmrv6e|hmrv6e|2|$TSLA in for a rocky month. I was bullgang until this morning it became apparent while there was a chance it would go over $1400 there seemed little hope it could hold that spike longterm. Downside risk became too high to see thousands (for some of you Hundreds of thousands) disappear in a moments notice. I sold in the AM when pricing was still in the air, 9 shares and 3 calls for 18K profit.

If you’re still long this market with shares in your 401K and IRA, you’re falling for the biggest con of our generation.  Wealthy investors, banks, hedge funds, etc were caught completely offsides during the March crash. They begged the Fed to bail them out and reinflate asset prices.   But here’s what they’re not telling you...they’re quietly cashing out from the market. The Fed pumped up prices so they could escape!  All the while those same crooks go on CNBC telling you, “stay invested for the long haul, the market will bounce back!”   It won’t. Not for a very, very long time. Can’t you see what they’re doing!?

Is that the retard in me talking? Therefore  I should inverse / inverse myself & sell?   I've made $800+ today, don't know if there's a clearer sign of the apocalypse 🤣|2020-07-07 11:10:19

Everyone will use delta earnings as a proxy for rest of industry.   - flipside, if delta is strong in earnings go for other airlines still to avoid Iv crush from earnings  - I believe there is a similar play with banks. Tons of banks reporting next week. I believe Citi is one of the first. They are sitting on tons of cash.... because they aren’t lending.... the fed is lending a ton. So, without lending I believe they’ll leg down. I’d recommend playing a different bank that will have earnings day or two after the other banks.   Good luck fellas|2020-07-07 12:38:28
