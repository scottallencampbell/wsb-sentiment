Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions have improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.   >   >The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.   >   >The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.   >   >To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.|2020-07-29 13:15:08

"If Congress doesn‚Äôt bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!" Trump wrote.  Minutes before Trump's tweet was posted, media reported that the testimony of the CEOs of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook has been pushed back for at least 60 minutes. The Congressional hearing was initially set to start  and now at 1 pm ET on Wednesday.  Bet safely!|2020-07-29 11:19:57

zlw9cj|hzy6my|hzy6my|36|Everything is priced in.  Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born.  Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of.  You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on WSB asking whether AAPL's China sales priced in or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.|2020-07-29 05:19:21

zm7a0w|hzy6my|hzy6my|3|Here‚Äôs my bets on what‚Äôs likely to happen with anti-trust:  Apple - unlikely to get hit with anything but will probably have to reform their App Store policies.

Facebook - doesn‚Äôt make sense to have anti trust, but I can see FB getting forced to sell off some social media platforms based on its handling of disinformation and general threat with disinformation. Congress could say we‚Äôve had enough, you have done too little with a lot of time and plan to break you up to scale down Zucks management over the conglomerate.  Amazon - I think their core businesses are safe AWS, e-commerce and shipping. Everything else is on the table just based on their size and reputation.

zmaipq|hzy6my|hzy6my|3|$CAR is a steaming pile of garbage. GAAP loss per share of $6.91 for Q2 on fleet utilization of roughly 35.1% (compared to 70.8% in Q2Y19). This utilization rate is also based on a 26% reduction in fleet size in Q2Y20.  Year-over-year, QTD revenue is down 67% and YTD is down 41%. The company‚Äôs revenue stream is heavily reliant upon airport traffic, which has been at historically low levels in Q2 and will most likely continue into Q3.  The company press release focused on the P&L with a small snapshot of its garbage balance sheet‚Äîstockholders‚Äô equity now at ($153M), down from $656M at FYE2019. The company was able to re-negotiate its debt covenants with lenders because they know that their balance sheet would not be strong enough to pass this quarter. They have been dodgy on the impact of the Hertz bankruptcy on its operations. Long story short, the used vehicle market has been flooded with fleet inventory.   The main message of the presser was being able to cut costs by $1B during Q2 by reducing headcount 60%, reducing fleet 26% and cancelling future orders. They also said non-airport rental locations are near pre-pandemic levels, but do not indicate what % of the business is linked to non-airport locations. Finally, they saw rental activity increasing in June into July as COVID restrictions were eased and people began to leisure travel.  TLDR - $CAR is a steaming pile of highly-leveraged garbage that should be shorted.|2020-07-29 08:25:43

zngisd|hzy6my|hzy6my|5|For those of you confused by the last 30mins let me explain: JPOW saying that they'll keep printing money despite the stock market "looking good" means "We don't think we've entered a recovery situation yet and things will get worse, so we're keeping interest rates near zero to limit the damage still to come." Basically they expect a crash and they want to dampen the fall. Look at any stock and across the board they all dip immediately after his announcement, followed by morons buying the dip, followed by more dip. Can't wait until we miss the stimulus deadline Friday.

zn6m2x|hzy6my|hzy6my|2|Implementation Note issued July 29, 2020  Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation  The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 29, 2020:  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent, effective July 30, 2020.  As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  "Effective July 30, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.  Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.  * Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.  * Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  * Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and all principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS in agency CMBS.  * Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.             Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions."  * In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent.  This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.  More information regarding open market operations and reinvestments may be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website.   https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200729a1.htm|2020-07-29 13:07:50

zngxgs|hzy6my|hzy6my|3|Alright boys. I'm back in on GLD after that dip.   Diagonal Calendar  8/21 185c long 8/14 190c short  I pretty much like using diagonal calendars to hedge and finance my long positions.   Nobody take my advice, as I am a small fry who don't know shit lmao   But my reasoning for jumping back in after that drop. Just based on gut feeling. It didn't drop that bad and started to recover. The inverse happened with the dollar. It spiked up really quickly, and then started to fall again.   As soon as the new stimulus package is passed, I could see us going to gold 2000. I plan to exit my position if I see about $100-150 profit per spread or if the direction starts to turn against me. If it does, at least it'll be somewhat protected by the short position and I take a smaller loss.   Good luck fuckers!|2020-07-29 14:29:01

zmzh9v|hzy6my|hzy6my|2|Ive officially opened up my war-pig portfolio  Commence the selling of puts on boeing, covered strangles of DFEN, and RTX with VXX hedge and leap puts to lower my asshole exposure in case of this market dumps again.  Long as time keeps moving, someone takes a vacation next summer, and we shoot someone in the face in the next few years, or threaten to do it, this should make some dollars.  Why?  History you dope. Time has never stopped, cant go tits up to be positioned to be a theta warrior on war  War, war never changes. Shits getting hot in the world, as a veteran myself who deployed overseas, this shit is HOT HOT HOT, so im betting on the DoD buying more tanks,planes, PAT3s, and ships, as well as hype up our space defense and cyber defense as china,iran and russia smack their chests at us.  Vacation, boeing being the big dick in the aviation industry also is the big dick in the war industry, so even if covid sticks around, their DoD funds will cushion them at this level. If COVID does properly fuck off, and china swings their dick, its a double play of boomers flying on 737 max 8s in the summer of 2021, and the DoD buying more F-15s, F-35s, and V-22s to go flex on GHYINA.   Conditions that fuck me; Democrats win. Big sad part:2 happens, DoD budget cuts.  Worst Case Scenario:I bag hold on the most american, blue chip of blue chip stocks.  Staying 50% cash, because life is uncertain, and i dont want to get my ass-creamed, i want to buy the dip or reverse my positions without going to MRE dietary status because im poor.   Expected returns 700 dollar weekly return if the market runs sideways or goes up. Protected from an 5% weekly dump.|2020-07-29 12:10:33

zn5agh|hzy6my|hzy6my|3|Okay help me out. Need some advice. This is all real.  I have $40 in my bank account and $90 in my Robinhood. I have rent for my college apt ($510) due next week.   I have RH gold, so instant deposits. I am certain that FedEx will moon on UPS earnings tmw morning and that TWOU (online education) will moon tmw AH on their earnings.  How stupid is it for me to withdraw $2k that I don‚Äôt have, bet on fedex and Twou earnings, and hope I can pay them back and say sorry  Edit: Lot of people saying this is dumb. Two questions. 1) how fucked would I be if the earnings go tits up. Like what‚Äôs the interest they could hit me with and how soon could they go for my nuts. 2) if my bank tells Robinhood that I don‚Äôt have any of the money I said I did, would RH immediately sell my holdings?|2020-07-29 12:56:57

zn3oiz|hzy6my|hzy6my|-2|I use Bux X, not robin hood (pls no h8)  If I buy a Long CFD on the nasdaq when its in a dip, could leverage it 10x. The fee would be 4% of the amount im betting, and the financing fee would be 30% of the original bet amount per year.  So if the nasdaq rises more than ~0.4% Ill break even, and I can hold indefenietly unless my CFD hits -100% Since its incredibly rare for nasdaq to drop 10%, isn't this a contract that cant to tits up? As long as nasdaq rises at least 3% in a year and doesnt drop 10% when a second wave hits?  Tldr; I profit if nasdaq rises 0.4%, I lose if nasdaq drops 10% good deal?|2020-07-29 12:44:09
