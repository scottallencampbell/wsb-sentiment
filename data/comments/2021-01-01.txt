hrfzhj|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|7|Whenever you hear someone say "Buy and hold" what they actually mean is:  * Buy and hold * Diversify * Rebalance from time to time.  No one thinks that you should buy and hold one thing forever because that one thing might go bankrupt and you might be missing out on something else which is sky rocketing. What they mean by "buy and hold" is don't fucking sell because of short term dips. If you time them wrong it can be disaaaaastrous cause not only do you sell for a loss of whatever% but if you don't get back in before things come back up you could miss out on huge gains on the up swing.   From this article: https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/31/missing-just-a-few-of-the-best-stock-market-days-c/  >How much exactly?  JPMorgan's asset management arm has put an exact price to these missed days in its Guide to Retirement report. If you invested $10,000 into the S&P 500 on Jan. 3, 2000 and left it completely invested until Dec. 31, 2019, you would've received an average annual return of just over 6%. Your $10,000 would've grown to $32,421.  >This 20-year period of time includes roughly 5,000 days during which the stock market was open. But as the table below shows, if you missed just the 10 best days out of those 5,000, you'd have less than half as much money. Miss the best 20 days, and you'd barely have made any money at all over 20 years, and you'd have lost money if you missed more winning days.  Time Invested Since Jan. 3, 2000	 Dollar Value 	Annualized Performance  * Fully invested into S&P 500	$32,421	6.06%  * Missed 10 best days  $16,180	2.44%  * Missed 20 best days $10,176	0.08%  * Missed 30 best days  $6,749	(1.95%)  * Missed 40 best days  $4,607	(3.8%)  * Missed 50 best days $3,246	(5.47%)  * Missed 60 best days $2,331	(7.02%)|2021-01-01 15:30:42

hpl27z|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|5|‚ÄúThus, the viable delivery fee range is somewhere north of $10 and at that price point demand falls off substantially. Who is going to order a $6.50 meal at Taco Bell and pay $10 to have it delivered?  I‚Äôm sure some people will, but it isn‚Äôt going to be enough to justify anywhere close to a $50B market cap. In order for DASH to work as a stock, demand growth would have to continue to be explosive and an enormous percentage of the population would have to be OK with paying $10-$15 delivery fees.  That's a tall ask and I don‚Äôt see it happening. $50B is far too much for a company that may never be profitable.‚Äù  #DASH TO ZERO IN 2021!!|2021-01-01 07:33:27

Lot of them were in the millions and held lot of typical boomer stocks/bonds but there was this one particular account that caught our eye because he only had two holdings with one being AMZN. He held  1200~ or some shares with like a $1~ average per cost. When we checked his history man legit opened the account a month or two before the IPO and bought 100 shares and diamond handed(or forgot??).

hrdoyb|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|7|Usually I wouldn‚Äôt post stuff like this in here, but markets are closed for a few days and I know this applies to some of you. **If you‚Äôre an aspiring gym bro give it a read, if not scroll by.**  Okay boys it‚Äôs the new year and I know some of you idiots are drooling thinking over the absolutely sick 6 pack you‚Äôre going to have next summer after you start going to the gym. You know, because you signed a hypothetical contract between your smooth brain and the rotation of the Earth or whatever. Here are some tips from someone who has been working out for 5 years and has a subjectively decent physique.  -Tip 1- Use your stupid money brain to your advantage. You don‚Äôt have to get addicted to the gym but you can get addicted to a pre-workout you take before the gym. Get a decent tasting pre-workout with 200-250mg of caffeine. Don‚Äôt go too crazy or you‚Äôll end up sick more often than pumped. Fuck anyone that says pre-workout is shit. This dose of caffeine is fine to take and a little bit of Sucralose isn‚Äôt going to kill you. Most pres have beta alanine and if you haven‚Äôt taken it before you‚Äôre going to feel like a crackhead but this calms down and personally I love the feeling. This craving of a quick dopamine spike will motivate you to get your ass off the couch. Half the battle is getting into your car to drive there.  -Tip 2- No one fucking cares how much weight you push if your form is shit. Start with low weight and focus on good form. I know you think the chick across from you in the lulus is dripping watching you snap your spine deadlifting 405, but she‚Äôs actually going gone to her boyfriend and laughing about the retard she saw in the gym punishing every collective joint in his body in one swift motion. No one is looking at you thinking you‚Äôre a pussy for deadlifting 135, actually they are probably mentally congratulating you for not being a buffoon like half the New Year guys.   -Tip 3- No one will tell you this, but you actually burn a minimal amount of calories during a lifting session. Your most intense workout of weight training will probably burn less than 300 calories. Before you get home and congratulate yourself with a pint of ice cream remember that you will be gaining back those calories burned and some. You will still build muscle, but you will put on fat.    I‚Äôm not going to make this any longer than it is, because I know you guys have trouble with the whole ‚Äúreading‚Äù thing. But feel free to ask questions/discuss. As dumb as you are I love you mother fuckers and I want to see you succeed|2021-01-01 15:10:17

hpy5d4|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|4|This isn't exactly the WSB prescription for options success but imagine a mindset shift next year of taking profits more often and preserving my capital more aggressively.  20% gains per trade. As often as you can. Ill take more if it seems likely but especially at market opens just fucking taking profit.  Theres unrealistic math that shows that with just 1000 bucks in like 45 trades someone could grow to a cool million. Assuming you suffer 0 setbacks. Again, unrealistic. But if your staying mobile, you can avoid days like yesterday.  This mindset of focusing on probability of profits üìà rather than hunting for the one big play is more sustainable for me personally.

Lots of big catalysts coming.  recently announced the successful completion of a pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the development of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) assisted therapy for an anxiety disorder.   üçÑ said preliminary data has been analyzed for its addiction treatment program evaluating the ibogaine derivative 18-MC, which the company named Project Layla. The preliminary data from the Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study has shown that the drug is safe and well tolerated at the doses tested to date, and no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) have been reported.  They also applied to be listed on NASDAQ. When that goes through, gonna rocket so fast. A lot of RHers have it on their radar but cant buy because robinhood sucks.    Psychedelics are the future for treating mental health disorders.   Honestly, the offering ends soon and anything under the offering price you should buy up.

hp72zs|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|0|Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you.    Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses.    Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day.   My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits.    Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid?  Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper.    Happy New Year|2021-01-01 05:23:19
hpn3vh|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|0|Sometimes Mr Market gives you a chance and it's not because he likes you. It's to test your retardation.  Prior to GME 52w high>>>>22.35, he asks you if you want to sell it for 22.40 in PM while the bid is 22.20 and the ask is 22.80  Yeah I took it.

hqhhph|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|0|> There is another contrast that comes to mind. When the going is good and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no quality at all make their appearance. They quickly find buyers; their prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels in relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with no overt efforts by anyone to call a halt before the inevitable collapse in prices. (The SEC can‚Äôt do much more than insist on disclosure of information, about which the speculative public couldn‚Äôt care less, or announce investigations and usually mild punitive actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly broken.) When many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enterprises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is all taken philosophically enough as ‚Äúpart of the game.‚Äù Everybody swears off such inexcusable extravagances‚Äîuntil next time.|2021-01-01 11:31:43

It also holds a 100% interest in the Western Foreland exploration project covering an area of approximately 2,550 square kilometers located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has a strategic partnership agreement with China Nonferrous Metal Mining (Group) Co., Ltd. to examine exploration, development, and acquisition of mineral projects, as well as production, smelting, and logistics opportunities in Africa.

hrc805|ko9i5u|ko9i5u|-10|Hey guys I'm a pretty new investor, just started a month ago, up about 2k with a small initial investment of 5k, I've been moving most of my profits out of my meme brokerage and slowly building a schwab retirement account that I don't intend to touch for some decades, in this account, I'm focusing on dividends, tech, semiconductors and recently debating to invest in some ETFs for the long-term.  I really love to invest in tech, robotics, AI, renewable etc.  My choices (that I've found so far are ) MOON, HACK, BOTZ. If anybody has some insight on these or potentially some other ETFs that hover around these sectors I would be very grateful!   TLDR: MOON, HACK, BOTZ or ???|2021-01-01 14:57:04
