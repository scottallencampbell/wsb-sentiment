knbyyv|fjj89q|fjj89q|1|Mod Notes (I'll be adding as we go along):  * [Robinhood Crash Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjk4va/preemptive_robinhood_crash_megathread_4_the). All RH complaints go there.  * If the market is halted/shut down on your expy date, you **cannot** trade your options and they will expire worthless if they're OTM. If they're ITM, you *can* exercise them.   * If short selling is banned, you can  still trade your options (referencing when this happened in 2008). However, [pricing and liquidity is going to change](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi%3Fdb_name%3DACE09%26paper_id%3D143&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjK8qj3-57oAhUImHIEHd-bDo4QFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw0kPIDDUZiHl2mBlgWVyMGz).  * [Market circuit breakers](https://i.imgur.com/QiJqDkg.jpg)  * Sourceless fear mongering is not allowed and will result in a **permanent ban**. Provide sources for your claims, at least to us mods FIRST, or don't post it.  * On a happy note, [the WSB Live Charity Stream](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhh5rs/the_wsb_charity_live_stream_for_autism_wednesday) is on Wednesday.  EDIT: On fear mongering; **You are being targeted** with FUD (Fear, Uncertianty, Doubt) posts by bad actors. Dozens of posts an hour. Don't ever believe -any- of it. We're removing it as fast as we can. Please report it when you see it. Bans are being given with no remorse so don't even think about any *"My X works for Y and everything is being shutdown. Ban if not true, lol"*.|2020-03-16 07:24:08

kn8vvq|fjj89q|fjj89q|123|I was waiting for the EOD pump on Friday, I had the options purchase screen open on my computer at 3:50 waiting for the right time to buy puts. I kept watching as it went up and up, getting more and more excited for cheap puts as it climbed. I had my finger on the button waiting to press it and lock in the sweet tendies I knew would be coming in the following weeks.  Then suddenly at about 3:55 I knocked over my glass of water, it streamed down the back of my desk on to the outlet and all over the power strip my computer is plugged into. I began to panic, but I held fast. Praying that my computer didn't shut off I continued to stare at the screen watching the puts get cheaper and cheaper. I began to hear a slight sizzling behind my desk, but I needed these puts at the cheapest price possible. I told my self the sizzling was just my imagination. I thought "Maybe this is a sign I shouldn't buy these puts?" I pondered this for a moment, but only a moment before I threw a middle finger to God and pressed the buy button to buy 35 SPY puts at 3:59.  Immediately after it went through I unplugged everything from the outlet and realized I probably have a gambling problem, but now at least this morning I have a gambling problem and some sweet sweet tendies.

It‚Äôs worse than any daily percentage loss seen during ‚Äò08 (worst day in ‚Äò08 was **SPX -9.04%** on October 15th, 2008).  Today‚Äôs close was also worse than the losses experienced on March 9th (now only the first Black Monday of 2020, **SPX -7.6%**) and March 12th (the Black Thursday of 2020, **SPX -9.51%**).

October 19th, 1987 (Black Monday ‚Äò87, **SPX -20.47%**)  Absolutely unbelievable. We are experiencing a seminal moment in human history, lads.

koslfx|fjj89q|fjj89q|24|I think from here on out, we'll see less and less bounces , with more and more consecutive down days . Trump looked defeated, and in a rare moment of candidness, he admitted to things not being so well lol.  As always, I would use EXTREME caution with weeklies, there's just no need right now. SPY puts dated a month or more out are pretty much low stress, guaranteed tendies.   I'm a bear, but not one of these uber doomer's. I think a bottom is near, probably around \~215 to 225 on SPY.    enjoy the ride and remember, TAKE PROFIT!!|2020-03-16 16:29:24
kpew17|fjj89q|fjj89q|22|Dont even think about buying into this market until we're at least  testing the 5 year lows around spy $190.  We are on the fast track there and the only thing that could stop it is a decline in daily new cases.  Look at the charts, the daily rate clearly shows we're nowhere near slowing.  This makes perfect sense, everyone infected in the airport crowds and bars and restaurants and casinos etc over the weekend wont even start to seek testing for another 4-7 days, and probably wont progress far enough to get one for at least 10 days. We have at least 2 weeks before we can even begin to assess whether the universal shelter in place is having effevt.  Further, the 2007-2009 peak to trough was 50%, the peak here is spy $340, so as low as $170 seems extremely plausible.   Guys, I dont see any reason why we wont get spy 190 as soon as Wednesday, certainly within the remainder of this week or next.   4/3 puts haven't even started relative to where they'll be by a week out from expiry, zero doubt.   It is so painfully obvious what is going on and you dumbfounded dumbshits are in denial.  They STILL can't tell us how many tests have been or can be done, they STILL cant give us any real data at all because of this, and oh by the way they STILL cant say they can meet the coming demand for intubators and ICU beds, and they STILL cant figure out how to do travel screening.  Most of all, DEVIN NUNES REPRESENTS THE MINDSET OF ALL BOOMERS.  Boomers have NEVER had to sacrifice for the common good, they are irretrievably selfish.  This will be their undoing, and I for one will be profiting while the prophesied Die Off runs its course.|2020-03-16 20:27:34

What if large number of people who make the whole thing work fall sick?  And if NYSE closes, everyone else must close or they will tank through the floor.  I'd still say the chance is low, but consider that if they DO close it, it will not reopen anytime soon - not until Peak Virus is over. Any short term puts are going to be toast. DO NOT BE ALL-IN IN THIS MARKET!!! Stonk holders and long dated call holders are probably fine if the unthinkable happens, but everyone else is going to be shitting bricks.  Plan accordingly.|2020-03-16 06:10:46

Hold the line and make sure your positions can take it. Risk management is key now, you'll need to stomach some wild movements. Daily swings will be crazy and very hard to predict, the big boys JUST rallied 10%+ on announcements of closures and massive revenue hits. But rest assured, the layoffs are happening (sorry friends), overvalued companies will come back to earth, euphoria will evaporate, the social fabric will be sewn with new stitches but be stronger then ever. We will get back to our roots and then build up a better society as a whole. The next bull market will be an extremely fun one that hopefully takes most of us to Valhella.

The guidance would likely focus on malls, restaurants and bars. Grocery stores and pharmacies could be exempt from the curfew. The idea would be fashioned after the European model, but would likely have to be enforced at a local level.  The source familiar tells CNN that a curfew is likely to be strongly encouraged at the state level during the President‚Äôs video teleconference with governors today.   The White House has not yet responded to CNN‚Äôs request for comment.  https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-16-20-intl-hnk/index.html|2020-03-16 09:32:48

The market tanks because people just want him to get serious about the whole pandemic bullshit.|2020-03-16 14:04:34

kn986w|fjj89q|fjj89q|6|>(Bloomberg) -- The Fed‚Äôs thrown everything it has at the problem, but let‚Äôs be clear: 100 bps of rate cuts, $700 billion of QE, deeps cuts from other central banks, and other measures are not the solutions to the economic problems confronting the United States and the world. Primarily they are about attempting to ensure the functioning of the financial system, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for rescuing the economy. Indeed, the lessons of the last week or so from the credit market is that just because you can trade doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll like the price. **That‚Äôs likely to be the case for equities again today and this week, partly because the dealer community is short gamma. Remember the big song and dance a few months ago about Bridgewater buying a bunch of index puts?** Well, evidently they roll off this week, and probably explain at least some of the frenetic price action in both directions as dealers scramble to hedge deltas as we blow through the strikes. As many of us have been saying, ultimately the solutions to our current problems are going to come from public health officials and fiscal policymakers. One can only hope that they both move with alacrity, and on the latter front don‚Äôt feel like the Fed has done the job for them. In Europe, while the ECB may not be there to close spreads, surely they aren‚Äôt there to put a bullseye on the chest of the BTP market, either-- which has been the effective outcome of last week‚Äôs press conference. There may be a time for fiscal Calvinism, but this isn‚Äôt it. In the meantime, the advice of the past few weeks remains as valid as ever: get liquid where possible.|2020-03-16 06:39:09

kne8mg|fjj89q|fjj89q|5|&#x200B;  TL;DR. How do I bet on China?   The US will continue crashing for awhile, but I've missed out on most of those tendies. So what comes next?  China is ramping up production again and has all the checks in place now to ensure that any reinfection won't turn into a massive outbreak again. It's likely there will be a 2+ month period starting next week or the week after where the US is shitting its bed and China is the main driver of the global economy. What do you bet on to profit off this? Demand will be down from most of the world on most sectors, but demand within China and much of east asia (minus Japan) will be back to normal.  Are there manufacturers to bet on? Will Alibaba go up? Is there something obscure?|2020-03-16 07:56:32

kofs7c|fjj89q|fjj89q|4|Ive got some testiing DD.  Read below:  Ive been sick for about 2 weeks and I have been trying to get tested for CV19 since Thursday. Nobody has been getting testing due to CDC guidelines and possibly test kit availability.  Finally, my doctor was permitted to order a test for me today. He is part of a hospital system so I gave my sample at their testing center.   The testing center is set up for CV19 patients only. Its part of a large hospital system in a midwest city that has an NFL team. The test center was located about 1 hour from downtown at the edge of the metro area. This was clearly a new building that hasnt had an active practice in it for some time. Maybe ever.   The protocol required me to call when I arrived and after a few minutes, a nurse in hazmat ppe met me at my car and walked me into the building. They are only letting one patient in the building at a time. There is one nurse in hazmat ppe and everyone else in the office is behind glass. I was in and out in 2 minutes. They told me expect results in 3 to 5 days.  Here are the take aways: A) hospital systems are now testing so expect a lot of bad news to avalance in the next 3 to 5 days as CV19 positive patient numvers sky rocket. B)hospitals are expecting this to be very bad. I work in laboratories and even did some BSL3 work and outside of BSL3 labs Ive never seen this level of infection control.   tl;dr hunker down, buy puts|2020-03-16 14:19:03

Flattening the curve won‚Äôt work because the numbers will still be too large for our ICU capacity.  The only solution in my understanding is a total shut down. Even then with this last weekend of St Patrick‚Äôs yolo‚Äôing, disneylanding, airport crowds will hugely increase future spread. Incubation 14 days.  Only now are we ramping up tests.  Oil shock, supply shock, demand shock, financial instability, limited fed tools left, lay offs, knock on effects, vicious cycle, inertia.  And general fear.

I think we might actually have Trump come out and halt the market for trading starting tomorrow during this state of emergency or whatever he wants to say.|2020-03-16 14:13:48

knu8bm|fjj89q|fjj89q|13|I am a bit baffled as are many of you at this pump but let's put this into perspective...  I live in Canada. In my province, we are about 7 million people, most of which are in one city (Montreal).  We have 41 confirmed cases as of a few hours ago. About 1800 are being tested currently and 2500 have tested negative. The first case we had here has now tested negative twice and seems to have recovered.  Schools and daycares are closed. Bars, gyms, cinemas, ski hills, etc... are all closed. Restaurants are at 50% capacity. Anyone 70+ is asked to stay home. Hospitals and nursing homes are not allowing visitors. Everyone is being asked to stay home unless they have to leave. Many, many people are working from home if they can.  We are likely shutting down the borders today, including the US border. All international flights are being diverted to 4 cities and passengers will be screened/instructed to self-quarantine. Very likely that all visitors will not be allowed into Canada.  We are taking some pretty extreme measures here and people are taking it pretty seriously. For a relatively low number of confirmed cases. And still, the government is putting out a message that this is a critical problem and we need to ACT NOW.  Now... contrast this to what is happening in the US. You can people filling bars in Nashville, going to concerts in Colorado, licking floors in churches. Half the country claiming the virus is fake even though Italy went from 3 cases to 30,000 in 20-something days.  If you think this is the bottom, if you think this has even remotely even started, you are in for a big surprise.  I am not saying to hold your puts. Chances are you will need liquidity in the coming months. I would not depend on your government in the times ahead, they have no clue what they're doing. And frankly, extreme measures to save this economy (halting options trading, etc...) are possible. It is going to get REALLY bad.  But if you hold your puts, they will increase in value. Sooner than you think.   My $0.02|2020-03-16 10:53:44

There is no way that the stocks are going to rise to $16 so why aren't those puts more expensive?   Because nobody is selling stocks right now so they don't need puts? Is it to risky because it could bounce like crazy tomorrow? Are they all scared to make trades because the market could be halted soon?      Couldn't I just buy some DL stocks and sell them for $16 with those puts?   Is there another reason for this?  Edit: ah it seems there be a 10:1 ratio so it's not a full put option apparently.

One saw a doctor and has been told it is not influenza but they do not have access to coronavirus tests at this time.  I'm considering puts on EWW.  Someone tell me if this is a good or bad idea?

Again, not a direct source, so do what you will with this info.  Follow-up question: Are markets open in countries under full quarantine? I don't want to hold my puts through a closure!  Edit: might be fake hence ‚Äútake with a grain of salt.‚Äù Added this to a comment below, but my best friend said he was told that news will be coming through with 48 - 72hrs according to his union rep.  Again, same thing, it‚Äôs secondhand information, but essentially the same info from 2 federal agencies; take with a grain of salt. One last note though - whether it‚Äôs in 2 days or not, this is happening in almost every country effected; it is a logical move to minimize spread.|2020-03-16 13:47:30

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to over leverage myself out of my whole portfolio, so I need an outsiders perspective.  Positions: *SPY* 3/27 260p x1 4/15 200p x3 5/1 240p x2 5/15 250p x2 5/15 230p x3  *SPXL* 4/17 30p x2  *CZR* 4/17 9p x10 6/19 10p x3  *LVS* 4/17 40p x2 5/15 35p x2 6/19 35p x2  I‚Äôm up 35-40k on around 20k initial investment in 2 months. However total realized gains are still around break even.  I need an outside perspective, because I‚Äôve been known to double down one too many times before. How can I go tits up? Market shutdown?
