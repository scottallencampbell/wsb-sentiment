Negative balances sometimes happen and we wanted to reach out to make sure you were aware, and also ask when you will be depositing funds to satisfy the outstanding balance on the account?  &#x200B;  *That's a great question Nadine, thank you for asking, i must admit to always improving the number of chromosomes i have through options trading.*  *You see, when i first downloaded robinhood i had far too many, but through careful and calculated losses i was able to smooth my brain to resemble a bowling ball, holes and everything.

So, they netted me the true spread versus the $8.65 mark on the PUT and loaned me $309k to make another $145 even though my account is 3.5x leveraged already. TDA is the shit|2021-02-26 15:38:03

Say it with me, kids: buying and selling stock is not a movement and only idiotic bag holders view it as such. It’s an individual, zero-sum, money making endeavor. Make money. Get out. Use that money to change the world if so inclined. But you don’t buy and hold stocks to effectuate change.

otp74r|lsvesi|lsvesi|4|Hi guy- just my thoughts on what’s going on. Wonder if anyone can provide their opinion of my logic.   1) Bond, fixed income and mutual fund managers (servicing pension/boomer/big family office clients) expect higher inflation in the future. 2) Start pulling money out of bonds as inflation will erode their annual 1-2% returns.  3) Yield increase (inverse function of bond prices). 4) The funds start investing in Dow Jones, traditional stocks as safer with predictable, steady cash flow. Ie. Avoid the Tesla type and tech stocks as too volatile for pensions which require steady cash flows.  5) thesis is to go long on value stocks with predictable cash flows for the rest of the year.

Looks like GME is the only ride to make money on with all the volatility.  I suspect large companies are buying and selling and making gains which is preventing it from squeezing or outright crashing.

oukb28|lsvesi|lsvesi|6|+5% bounce mm... resistance is strong.  Still though, PLTR investors should learn a thing or two from TSLA bois. A lot of people in this sub showing such a lack of willpower when we went up 300% in 1 quarter, but when TSLA fell 2.5x to sub 200 pre split they were out there strong.   PLTR has way more potential to scale effectively and economically, and half of the stuff I'm seeing is whining about a < 50% dip from a feverish high. We will get there fast but let the news drip on all the partnerships showing the versatility of the software until there's no going back ever again.|2021-02-26 11:03:01

What I think will happen is Boomer/Value stocks will continue to increase post correction, while the euphoric tech stocks will baseline at their pre-euphoria support and will remain stagnant/slowly bleed until the companies start producing material product and profit - which would be a 1-3 years out.

otllpw|lsvesi|lsvesi|8|FFS.  Google valuations 101.  Look at the equations.  Valuation theory takes into account 'risk free rate'....which is often set at the rate for bonds. When risk free rates go up, valuations go down. That's why the market is getting crushed. Valuations are very sensitive to changes in risk free rate.   Wait until the 10 year stabilizes before buying back in. It'll get hairy until then.  It looks like it may keep climbing until somewhere in the range of 1.7-2.0.|2021-02-26 06:24:28

ov8hm3|lsvesi|lsvesi|11|Since someone asked, here is a basic explanation of why the apes seem so much like QAnon devotees:  It is because, as is the case with most conspiracy theories, dumb people like to feel smart, like they know something that others don’t. It makes them feel important and compensates for their insecurity over their lack of intelligence. Therefore the same idiots who can be grifted into believing that a third rate reality star is the secret leader of a joint law enforcement/military operation to take down a ring of Hollywood pedophiles funded by Democrats who are reptile aliens (yes, that is QAnon in a nutshell) are also susceptible to being conned into thinking they are part of some sort of movement that will bankrupt corrupt hedge funds and make them millions in the process. All they have to do is dump all of their money into a stock that, at best, is a decent but risky long term play, at worst, is worthless. Which, to them, makes more sense than their other option of sending money to the deposed Prince of Nigeria who emailed them.   And now that this sub has gotten mainstream attention, it has attracted a ton of dumb people. The reason for that is, because in addition to being attracted to conspiracy theories, dumb people are prone to falling for get rich quick schemes. Especially when those schemes are broadcast by major news networks. So of course there are a lot of them here.   Tl; dr - They aren’t bots. They are just really stupid people looking to fill a void and therefore are being exploited by smarter people and tricked into shooting themselves square in the foot.|2021-02-26 13:03:53

ou14ux|lsvesi|lsvesi|3|Guys who are buying back into WKHS... good luck. I think this will be a good long term 1 year+ play, but if you’re betting on the contract I’m sorry to say but your chances are slim.  Be cautious about your buy, a contract was already awarded to OSK... just because politicians want to halt it doesn’t mean the deal will get stopped. This is mostly being done for political theatre, if there’s already a contract in place it could cause a ton of mess both financially and legally to get out of it. Also, it’s sort of bad faith to retract on a contract for no reason once it’s already been placed.  Source: Am a Buyer.|2021-02-26 08:50:05

ourx47|lsvesi|lsvesi|3| Earlier this month, Ocugen finalized an agreement to co-develop and commercialize Covaxin in the United States. The developer of Covaxin, Bharat Biotech, is now selling the product in its home country, India, under emergency clearance. As part of the deal between the two companies, Ocugen will retain 45% of Covaxin's profits in the United States; Bharat will pocket the rest.  &#x200B;  Vaccines against infectious diseases are not the usual activity of Ocugen. The company specializes in gene therapies for eye diseases that cause blindness. The company has three such candidates in the pipeline for eight indications. The four most advanced programs, which aim to treat retinal degeneration associated with a genetic mutation, will then move on to phase 1 studies.  &#x200B;  The decision to partner with Bharat on Covaxin is good news because it brings a product closer to the market. And Ocugen has taken steps to ensure a successful launch. The company has established a scientific advisory committee on vaccines comprising six experts from industry and academia. Ocugen also raised $ 23 million in a direct offering of shares to institutional investors. One can imagine funds from this operation supporting the advancement of Covaxin in the United States  &#x200B;  It is too early to tell if Covaxin is an effective vaccine candidate; we will have to see the data from phase 3 first. Bharat expects to generate results by March. Ocugen points out one positive detail, however: Covaxin has elicited an immune response to various viral proteins - not just the spike protein that the virus uses to infect host cells. This gives Covaxin a better chance to beat new strains of the virus. As mutations transform the spike protein, vaccines focused only on the spike may lose their effectiveness.|2021-02-26 11:36:11

"That's why these people have been dumping bonds, and their wholesale selling always smashes the stock market." If that is the case and they don’t want to own bonds wouldn’t the only logical place to put money to work be stocks and in turn cause the stock market to go up?|2021-02-27 12:22:03

And peppermint. But you know? How many of ya know what peppermint is? Its like candy canes, but the other guy, cmon man, he don't like Christmas. Its never candy canes with that guy, he doesn't trust the scientists. We are gonna trust the scientists. Now Barack Obama, god rest his soul, he knew a thing or two about markets.

So I can buy bonds for a little cheaper... BFD.

I'm looking for bargains today - and not buying bonds.  Obviously go GME and AMC, but also interest in SOLO as an "alternate play" in the EV space.  Small, affordable EVs should fit in nicely with the transition over time to more enviro-friendly policies and practices.

ovbit3|lsvesi|lsvesi|8|Because it bears repeating with some degree of regularity considering how quickly this thread moves:  > Since someone asked, here is a basic explanation of why the apes seem so much like QAnon devotees:  > It is because, as is the case with most conspiracy theories, dumb people like to feel smart, like they know something that others don’t. It makes them feel important and compensates for their insecurity over their lack of intelligence. Therefore the same idiots who can be grifted into believing that a third rate reality star is the secret leader of a joint law enforcement/military operation to take down a ring of Hollywood pedophiles funded by Democrats who are reptile aliens (yes, that is QAnon in a nutshell) are also susceptible to being conned into thinking they are part of some sort of movement that will bankrupt corrupt hedge funds and make them millions in the process. All they have to do is dump all of their money into a stock that, at best, is a decent but risky long term play, at worst, is worthless. Which, to them, makes more sense than their other option of sending money to the deposed Prince of Nigeria who emailed them.   > And now that this sub has gotten mainstream attention, it has attracted a ton of dumb people. The reason for that is, because in addition to being attracted to conspiracy theories, dumb people are prone to falling for get rich quick schemes. Especially when those schemes are broadcast by major news networks. So of course there are a lot of them here.   > Tl; dr - They aren’t bots. They are just really stupid people looking to fill a void and therefore are being exploited by smarter people and tricked into shooting themselves square in the foot.|2021-02-26 13:18:25

p1nknk|lsvesi|lsvesi|2|Hello, does anyone happen to know if it is worth (in your opinion) investing in Foxconn Technology (TPE 2354) through their alternately named company Hon Hai Precision Company ($HNHPF)? I am unable to directly purchase shares of Foxconn as this company is not listed on US exchanges and I presently reside in the US. HNHPF is available in the US, however, and is listed as an OTC, but the trading volume is pretty low as is the stock price. I am a little confused by this considering their many partnerships with successful companies including Apple and Amazon, and their most recent deal with Fisker, which caused Fisker’s share price to increase, but HNHPF actually dropped. I  have heard that this is probably due to their poor business ethics causing investors to shy away, but I am not sure if that is the sole reason as that hasn’t stopped investors before. I would have expected that there would be more interest in this company and that the stock would be trading at a higher volume and price, but maybe I’m missing something? If anyone has any information, I would greatly appreciate it. I just don’t want to throw any money at this company if there isn’t going to be much projected movement in the stock. Thank you.|2021-02-27 11:58:51

otlg1a|lsvesi|lsvesi|6|No one said a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. Some of us have been holding for months. Of course, that doesn’t even begin to compare to DFV, who’s held for years, even through massive selloffs in late 2020. So instead of worshipping Keith for being the absolute Chad that he is, you can do yourself a favor and hold the damn line. This is like a staring contest in which you’re allowed to keep your eyes closed but the other person has to keep them open. You can hold longer than they can. When that GME documentary comes out, just remember: If you sold, you aren’t a part of the movie… Ok, well I guess gay bears *are* still part of the movie, but no one likes them. All my homies and me hate gay bears.  Be sure to send your friends and family a postcard from the moon. I’m not sure if they’ll be able to get another one once we reach Pluto or even the next galaxy over.   This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor.

That would be down from revenue of $1.4 billion in the last quarter of 2019. However, it's less important how AMC did in the past than what executives say about the near-term future that matters.   AMC will open its doors open March 5 at AMC's 13 NYC locations.  AMC has been raising cash to bolster its balance sheet until life can return to normal. Given the recent developments, defending movie theaters as an investment is "no longer 'Mission Impossible.".|2021-02-26 11:10:05

ousjww|lsvesi|lsvesi|1|If you have large holdings on stocks you can sell covered calls at a strike price you feel comfortable the stock will not reach. For example, I own 600 shares of MGNI. My cost basis is 50 per share, at $30,000 total. I sold 5 calls at around 400 each, for a total of $2,000 premium with a strike price of $60 on 3/12. If the price doesn't reach $60 by this date, I keep my shares plus the 2k. If it does reach 60 (worst case scenario), I am forced to sell 600 shares for $36,000 and keep the $2,000 for a total of $38,000 in receipts. 38-30= $8K in 3 weeks.

ovgehz|lsvesi|lsvesi|3|Hey Autists, I know this is not your thing, but I think you should still read about the potential of value stocks:   The past decade hasn’t been kind to value investors, and their ranks have thinned.  However, this might change soon.   The catalyst is happening now: As interest rates go higher and inflation starts to come back, the value of future earnings of growth stocks won’t be valued as richly. A higher-interest-rate environment is going to be a great tailwind for value investors.    It’s going to surprise people and happen sooner than people think. The economy is coming back so strong. There’s so much pent-up demand. We’ll get this huge stimulus plan from President Joe Biden, and it’s going to put a lot of pressure on commodity prices and wages.   Read the Full article and list of top Value stocks below:  [https://mosttraded.com/2021/02/26/top-value-stocks/](https://mosttraded.com/2021/02/26/top-value-stocks/)  &#x200B;  Do you think value stocks can show good results in the coming years?|2021-02-26 13:41:50

It was a time wasting cycle on repeat the whole day. So please, talk to your loved one, play a hobby, hang out with your friends, catch up on all those porn files you saved, hit the gym, get some school work done, and THEN go be degenerates being glued to the screen watching a line go up and down and up and down and up.

ou83mc|lsvesi|lsvesi|6|Friendly reminder to the Apes: DFV did, in fact, have an exit strategy. It was selling enough to make a profit upward of $10 mil and then reinvesting in another dip and probably cashing out profits on that also. The fact that he is holding shares for longterm purposes doesn’t change the fact that he has profited to the tune of 8 figures. He had an exit strategy and he followed it.   Don’t mistake a joke made in passing as gospel truth. If you can make some money off this, do it. If you just want to cover your expenses and hold for longterm purposes, do that. Personally I think GME is a terrible longterm play  because, Cohen or not, it is a company pivoting from brick and mortar about 10 years too late into a field overrun with competition, all of whom have a head start of a decade at least.   But I digress. My underlying point is quit taking a throwaway joke post as financial advice. And doubly so, quit treating it as if it is some sort of holy declaration from a divine prophet. There is no shame whatsoever in making some money. That should be the goal. There is no shame in mitigating damages. If you can’t make a profit, that’s what you ought to be doing. There is no honor in bringing about your own financial ruin for upvotes.  Not financial advice. Not a professional trader or financial advisor. Just an idiot who is fascinated by the psychology that is driving this.|2021-02-26 09:42:57

otgxag|lsvesi|lsvesi|4|Don't sell. Here's a relatively smart boomer telling these bond boomers they're fucking stupid.   Financial Times: Pimco boss warns of inflation ‘head fake’. https://www.ft.com/content/9ed5c0f2-5c2a-4a1f-98f6-e864f5d62e24  >One of the most powerful US bond managers has warned of an “inflation head fake”, where misplaced concerns about a rise in consumer prices cause a jump in bond yields.  >The comments by Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at Pimco, which has $2.2tn under management, come after long-dated US Treasury yields climbed to their highest level in a year.  >The dramatic move reflects expectations of a robust economic recovery, further fiscal stimulus from Joe Biden’s administration and the willingness of the Federal Reserve to tolerate core inflation running above 2 per cent.  >There is a material risk for the bond market of an inflation head fake,” Ivascyn told the Financial Times in an interview on Tuesday. “This could be a powerful recovery and we have never gone from locking down an economy to opening it back up with this amount of stimulus.”  >Pimco expects any inflation pick-up will prove temporary, but “the bond market may not come to that conclusion in the near term”, Ivascyn said.  >Inflation will remain contained because of long-established trends such as technological innovation cutting costs and the weakness of organised labour, Pimco has argued. Slack will also linger in the labour market due to high unemployment, Ivascyn said.  >“We still see powerful disinflationary trends. After an initial recovery [from the pandemic] there is likely a world of excess capacity,” he said.  >As the pandemic hit the global economy last spring, the Fed’s preferred measure of annual core inflation briefly fell below 1 per cent, from 1.65 per cent a month earlier. Even after a rebound it remains below the US central bank’s target of 2 per cent.  >However, expectations for the average level of inflation over the next decade, as derived from bond prices, have risen to nearly 2.2 per cent, the highest level seen since 2014, reflecting in part surging commodity prices.  >Inflation erodes the value of the interest payments on bonds, and dents the debt’s value, so these nerves have tipped global government bond markets into their weakest start to a year since 2015. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury breached 1.4 per cent on Wednesday, having started the year at about 0.9 per cent. Yields rise when prices fall.  >Yields remain low by historical standards. But the fact they have been so low over the past year has provided a key support for stocks, which have rushed higher over the past 11 months. As they pick up, particularly real yields that are adjusted for inflation, investors fret that some of the frothier corners of the stock markets are left vulnerable. Rising real yields have already been a factor in a 4 per cent drop in the technology-heavy Nasdaq index since mid-February.  >“The back-up in rates has been healthy,” Ivascyn said. “A further rise in real yields would hit risk assets like equities and see policy adjustments.”  >He predicted that the Federal Reserve could intervene if the rise in yields accelerates. This would more likely take the form of strong statements designed to hold down long-term rates, rather than policy changes such as buying long-dated bonds to control yields.  >“I don’t believe yield curve control is around the corner [but] we may get the type of rhetoric that seeks to achieve that policy goal,” he said. **A rise in 10-year yields beyond 1.5 per cent would represent a “good buying opportunity for investors”, he added.**|2021-02-26 05:23:19

otwspz|lsvesi|lsvesi|3|Ok i saw a lot of people worried and disapointed about PLTR so lets talk about that! Great company with a lot of potential!    The price decreased on future prospects with the revenue growth prediction. First of all its a lower % increase but a higher increase and they are beiing conservative for sure they will beat forecasts.   PLTR lost money due to compensations to board and soon they will turn a profit and the increase in the stock that news is going to bring!!   Second they work with other businesses to help them so they benefit with a good economy in which other companies have more money to spend.(my view at least).     Last thing that no one is talking. Last year R&D(development) spending was huge including last semester. Just dont think PLTR is going to have only that amount of products forever.      Talking valuation 23 is so dam cheap i would valued then at 35 today and i can see then at 50/60 in some time    BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY|2021-02-26 08:14:58

ou7zzm|lsvesi|lsvesi|3|Not a financial advisor. Just an asshole with an opinion on Reddit.  Right now the market has been getting slammed by this implied rate hike from the bond market. Despite JPowell explicitly saying the fed will not raise rates for the foreseeable future...  My hot take: we might be witnessing the end QE’s effectiveness. We could be in for a huge blood bath and an end to a historically long bill run.  With that said, I’m not inclined to sell my portfolio. I will just avg down. But might be time to load up on otm puts as a hedge. I think this could be worse than we currently realize. I haven’t seen rumbling like this before.   Edit: before the end of the day. I’m going to load up on some otm puts. Maybe 2022 expiry. I think I could be on some micheal burry level gains.|2021-02-26 09:42:14

It has stability and some great upside.  The Webull analytics have its valuation as high as 60 dollars per share with the average being around 45-48 dollars per share.

The company is in talks with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding an Emergency Use Clearance (EUA) pathway for its candidate. Suddenly it looks like Ocugen is just a few steps from the finish line.  &#x200B;  As a result, Ocugen shares have climbed more than 350% year-to-date, and the company's market capitalization has risen to $ 1.56 billion, from around $ 350 million during that year. period. So with the possibility of a new coronavirus vaccine hitting the market in the United States, should you buy Ocugen stock?|2021-02-26 11:35:06

You’re going to get burnt if you have “diamond hands”.  I made my money on calls and now have switched to puts.  Double dip and make money.    Imagine we all just agreed to short AMC and GME.  Instead of fighting against each other and the big guys we will all have the same bets and it will tank.  And make moneys.

"I wanted to create a central archive of the good information on NovaStar that appeared on Yahoo message board posters, by people who are hugely knowledgeable on the sector and the market.

owd2q8|lsvesi|lsvesi|1|Anyone else here buying TMRC and NIOBF shares?  I invested pretty heavily on both when they were below $1 a share. TMRC seems to be doing pretty good ($3.91), but NIOBF is slow as molasses.  I've already doubled my profits on NIOBF and the Nebraska mine won't open 'til April, but I've read some negative reviews online so I'm undecided as to remain or leave NIOBF.  Anyone else have any input regarding NIOBF?|2021-02-26 16:21:33

ouwitf|lsvesi|lsvesi|1|Well guys. With short float % dropping lower and lower by the day, and Gme’s price not shooting “to the moon” (I guess $200 wasn’t bad, but certainly not moon compared to $480), it seems y’all’s opportunity is coming to an end.   With less shorts, the squeeze is virtually impossible. If the squeeze doesn’t happen by Monday or Tuesday then it’s over. So don’t be an idiot and be prepared to exit if it doesn’t pop off.

The massive black reversal candle from yesterday confirmed that the downtrend and probable retrace well back below 40 was underway...  The entire dynamic of the equity markets have changed. What is happening is historic and will wipe out wealth on a scale that hasn't been seen in a few hundred years. STONKS CAN AND DO GO DOWN YOU SILLY FOOLS and sometimes they go to ZERO. Consult years 1929, 2000, 2007...and now 2021.  There is NOTHING NEW under the sun and no new paradigms. Only new fools and victims.|2021-02-26 10:49:47
oulpeb|lsvesi|lsvesi|-5|Alright GME apes, heres how to play GME. Do not play the squeeze, that is retarded and pays out 1/10,000 times. Play the Ryan Cohen becoming CEO and e-commerce transition.  Until rumors of Ryan Cohen becoming start brewing, GME over $70 is overpriced, buy a little GME under $50, get larger chunks under $40, YOLO under $30.  GME history YOLO’d at $12-$17 sold on the way up to $300 (2kish shares total). Rebought sub $40, planned to yolo sub $30, saw CFO news and bought a chunk at $45 sold at $150 (500ish shares total)  I will rebuy sub $50 and get more sub $40 and YOLO under $30. If more news comes out sub $60 could be a value play.   RC CEO price target GME $200.   Now why would RC become CEO? because the entire board has a shiton of shares and all of them know RC ceo = 🚀🚀🚀. George Sherman and the boomer board knows if RC becomes CEO their net worth will 2x-3x just on news alone.

oug83d|lsvesi|lsvesi|1|I’m still looking for about a 10% total correction out of this volatility. Surprisingly, the out of the money puts that I sold expiring March 19 are holding up pretty well. Of 90 puts that I sold, only two have a less than 50% chance of expiring out of the money, and those are for the gold miner Newmont, which I would be OK owning at 55 given that gold should go up as an inflation hedge. if my put selling income strategy does well in this environment, it should work in any. Currently, I would clear about 9K in premium if they all expire worthless.

ov9j8g|lsvesi|lsvesi|-1|There is so much cheerleading for GME, AMC, etc. to "diamond hands" it, but this seems to drown out anyone concerned that a stock that goes up to X times its fair valuation is almost by definition destined to come back down! Stocks don't stay in the stratosphere indefinitely, looking at EVERY other overvalued stock in history.  If GameStop were to perfectly execute its growth strategy, it could be worth $47/share, for instance, according to the optimistic scenario outlined by NYU Professor Aswath Damodaran. It's swung between double and triple that today.

But we know market cap is a better indicator of value than share price, right? So what's the market cap of USD? Thats right M2 money supply. Price SPY in M2 and we are still below precovid highs.

Know that the fear in your heart is miniscule to the terror they face. They are mere kittens showing their teeth. The battle is already won.

ourbtr|lsvesi|lsvesi|-14|Apes, Autists, and Retards  I hate to give such discouraging news, but GME is a dead cat. The tendies will not be grasped unless we focus our collective retardation towards AMC and the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Monday will become a historic day in which we rise towards the top ranks of special needs. It is time to push AMC above $10 and collect our tendies from the shorters that suck from the teet of Apes. PUSH AMC TO $10 BEFORE CLOSE. WE WILL BUILD STATUES ABOUT THIS DAY. DIAMOND HANDS FOREVER AND ALWAYS. AMC TO THE MOON.  Signed,  Retard|2021-02-26 11:33:34

ovlvh6|lsvesi|lsvesi|-5|$FUBO is a sports based streaming service that's now rolling out their own sportsbook.  Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >"About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states."  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$2 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.  * **53mm float** * **28 % short** * **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**  &#x200B;  Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg. The "squeeze" would be backed by fundamentals, and sustained.   &#x200B;  **TLDR:**  **$FUBO TO $200**|2021-02-26 14:07:51

otjydx|lsvesi|lsvesi|-2|Hey guys, just a general question here because i'm kind of stuck right now. I want to get into buying stocks in general. I've followed what's been happening for a while, I've read quite a bit and all. Thing is, I'm an american citizen living in France. I tested a few stock sites and apps and most of them tell me that either I can't use the apps/sites because I'm an american citizen and it's just not allowed for american's living in France, or that I need to have an american address (which I simply don't). Has anybody been in a similar situation, and if so, is there a solution? I haven't lived in USA for like 19 years now so idk anything about if it's a reporting tax issue, if I can just use a relative's address or whatever (left at a young age to the Caribbean and now to France about a year and a half ago).|2021-02-26 06:04:40

ovxryg|lsvesi|lsvesi|-3|I saw a video on a feed of someone talking about shorting any stock talked about on Wall Street bets to profit off of the volatility,  the influencer was on a new ish platform, so I yeah I get its not financial advice but I was wondering, how manny retail traders would bet against Wallstreet bets favored stocks, as a result of an influences suggestion and then of course I just asked myself well there are a bunch of people that put tons of cash into gamestop. So whats to stop any given number of retail traders to short to make a profit, if short ladder attacks are a weapon used to drive the price down then let's say there was a company that did some real unethical stuff and the public wanted to do more than just protest.is that somthing that could happen if you had millions of people  rejected the company financially like worse than a boycott. I was just curious. I know that Wallstreet bets is a small part of the equation as to why gamestop had surged in price so they can't really move the market but could the public realistically unite under an idea to correct you k unjustly or unethically ran company.|2021-02-26 15:04:13

otv0xq|lsvesi|lsvesi|-13|Okay. So apparently this is not worthy of it's own post (gets filtered), so I'll post it here. Just this once, but this took me about 45 mins to get right, so I don't want it to go to waste. I think this "keeps shitposting to a minimum", since it is just one post. Enjoy.     Holding out for J Powell - Our hero  (To the melody of Bonnie Tyler's "Holding Out For A Hero")  Where have all the tendies gone   and what about my calls?

I'm gonna need a big p_u_mp to save me in this tonight   It's gotta be big, and it's gotta be soon   And it's gotta be larger than life   Larger than life    Somewhere after midnight   In my wildest fantasy   Somewhere just beyond my reach   Are tendies beckoning at me-heeeee   The S&P five-huhundreed is rising with the heat   It's gonna take a green di-hil-do to deliver what I neeeeeed! NEEEED!  I need Jay Po-Well!   I'm crying out to jay pow: "print for the rest of the night"   he's tough and he's fast and he's printing the cash   till gay bears run away from the fiiiiihight.

I'm crying out to jay pow: "print for the rest of the night"  Up where the stonks meet the rockets above   Up where the moon is really near   I could swear there is daddy Elon watching me  Through the drop and the halts and the pain   And the red and the blood   I feel it going green in my big, throbbing cooooock   (in my big throbbin cock,   in my big throbbing cock in my big throbbing - COOOCK,   COOOOOCK)  I need Jay Po-Well!

oud8u2|lsvesi|lsvesi|-6|Hey guys, I created a separate thread for this company but a few people have said I should put it in here.  Not looking to get shit on or anything, just wondering your guys thoughts.    AABB is a US Company that is nearing completion of creating a gold backed cryptocurrency.  Also, they're creating a platform that allows for the exchange of cryptocurrencies (almost like venmo, paypal, etc) and would allow for inter currencies exchange. Currently, they are trading at 20 cents a share and have seen a small bump in share price due to recent media exposure, but the majority of institutional and retail investors haven't heard of AABB yet.  Anyway, I am creating this thread to discuss this stock and raise awareness of the potential.  Please feel free to comment your thoughts and ideas around where this could go.|2021-02-26 10:20:24
