Germany cancelled Tesla’s prelim manufacturing of 2k cars while factory is being built for incorrect paperwork. Forced them to scrap it.  California is potentially shutting down Tesla autonomous testing in the state.  Solar city lawsuit is coming to a post trial judgement soon.

sma8kx|s3pq81|s3pq81|4|/r/thetagang this morning One of us, one of us!   So on 12/1 Cloudflare (NET) had a big red day, and I sold, what I    thought were 10 Cash-Secured Puts (Stupid I know) for 1/21 140 strike. I    am 34 grand in the hole already, and NLV is \~22,400 after today. I also    just realized, that these puts are not cash-secured and I won't be able    to take assignment on these. Really didn't expect Cloudflare to go down    this much. What are my options in this position? I've had to BTC two    contracts to avoid margin call already. When will this stock come back?|2022-01-14 06:05:11

This could conceivably eviscerate the bear while causing fatal injury.”  BREAK OUT OF YOUR BULL/BEAR PARADIGMS PEOPLE THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE KANGAROOOOOOOO|2022-01-14 08:59:01

sppxvt|s3pq81|s3pq81|4|JPM vs Citi bank today  Yesterday I bought some puts for jpm and made about 900% gain, but I have a question. Why is it that this stock like Citi bank’s stock both moved roughly around the same percent at least as of 9:30am today, yet the citibank puts are disappointing compared to this one. I don’t fully understand the greeks and have some knowledge on IV. I usually just trade company shares don’t have too much experience with options. Can someone explain why JPM was a way better stock to trade options vs Citibank today? They both had similar disappointing revenue statements. I bought JPM 160p for 0.35, yet at about the same percent out of the money options yesterday were similarly priced for citi bank. JPM performed great and citi puts did poorly yet both companies posted disappointing revenues for Q4.  Thanks|2022-01-14 20:29:25

smsj43|s3pq81|s3pq81|2|What Is a Bull Trap? A bull trap is a false signal, referring to a declining trend in a stock, index, or other security that reverses after a convincing rally and breaks a prior support level. The move "traps" traders or investors that acted on the buy signal and generates losses on resulting long positions. A bull trap may also refer to a whipsaw pattern.|2022-01-14 08:38:31

sny75z|s3pq81|s3pq81|5|I saw Jim Cramer at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.        The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.        When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.|2022-01-14 13:08:55

Any 50 basis pt. rise in the fed funds equates to a 7% rise in net interest margin and 16% increase in value per share. Not to mention a shit load left in buy backs, and if they remove the asset cap just icing on the cake. With 4 potential rate hikes, fed funds would go up an addition 100 basis pts.

snjhki|s3pq81|s3pq81|1|Anybody else considering a BABA earnings play? Earnings come out Feb 2nd. Thinking now would be a good time to start setting it up and entering positions. I played it too early and went ahead and ditched most of my positions on this bounce. But I’m thinking it’s just dead cat bounce and there’s extra room to ride it down now.   Thesis: Chinese consumer spending is slowing, pandemic issues are causing growing disruption, Olympics are almost here and it’s gonna be a major black eye for them & leave Beijing less room to maneuver with responses given the high profile international presence and attention, Chinese economic instability hasn’t magically been fixed just because Evergrande isn’t in the news everyday. BABA thus has room to drop on 2 fronts - artificial increased valuation due to western monetary policy and Chinese monetary policy/economic woes.|2022-01-14 11:33:56

smtvy6|s3pq81|s3pq81|-4|I’ve said this so many times on this sub but I’ll say it again.   Markets will not be in a sustained free fall over rate increases.   There needs to be a liquidity crunch to get a true crash with circuit breakers.   If you’re a bear and just buying short term puts, you’re still just gambling (like everyone here).   There probably will be a liquidity event in the next few years, but that will take time. The fed raising rates will be the cause of it but it could take awhile for the effects to be seen. Good luck getting the timing right on that.|2022-01-14 08:47:52
