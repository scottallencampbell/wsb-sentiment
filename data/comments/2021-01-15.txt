jcfj2z|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|25|u/ucjor’s post is so important. Melvin and these massive firms pull the strings and don't care how it impacts the hard-working class. People who work all day, struggle to get by and they're just another statistic that the government has to take care of. Then these big banks and institutional firms get trillions in tax breaks every year cause they're "helping to create jobs" and "providing working capital for businesses". Bull shit. All they care about is profit and don't give a shit about who they hurt in the process. We are captain now.  Lets drive GME to $60 and PLTR to $40 TODAY.|2021-01-15 08:20:19

jezram|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|14|When I look at [GME's chart last week](https://imgur.com/a/MKBVPOn), I don't see a pump and dump. Sure, there's a pump, but not really a dump. Even though we closed on a red day, it had the second highest daily closing price in **over 5 years**, and held onto 70% of the weekly gains (open at $19, peak at $43, close at $36).  Going out to a [much longer timeframe](https://imgur.com/a/EpBtOVx), there's nothing that looks like weakness to me at all. If anything, that's a massive pole for the biggest bullflag in history.  Maybe I'm crazy, and maybe I'm [talking my book](https://imgur.com/a/fSHxnVI). From what I can see though, the dump next week is not a certainty by any means. If anything, a continued run seems more likely. This is especially true given that anyone who's holding now has the balls to hold through a long weekend after a major run.  Only diamond hands remain.|2021-01-15 21:07:00

jddqa5|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|22|Gentlemen, I'd like to point something out to you, take it for what you will.  &#x200B;  When you advocate for people to buy shares of GME instead of calls (because volatility has driven premiums to the roof) you shut down the prime mover of the price action.  (That is market makers buying shares to hedge your yolos and stay delta neutral.)  &#x200B;  Look at it this way, when you buy your ridiculous FD, market makers have to buy shares to cover it because they don't want to lose money.  If you suddenly aren't doing that anymore, and are instead buying shares, then they don't have to do that anymore, and today being expiry for a hell of a lot of GME options, they can safely sell the shares they bought EOD.  &#x200B;  Now, I'm not going to come down on the issue one way or the other, but telling people to buy nothing but calls for months and then suddenly switching to shares is going to result in... Well, I'm sure you can put it together.|2021-01-15 12:50:25

jd9s63|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|12|Today is embarrassing..  Yesterday I bought  £50k of CVIC shares at $17.6. Watched it drop down to mid $16 today. Went on a bike ride when it was at $18. Set my stop loss at $16.0 as it'll never drop that much I thought. It sold 60% of them and then shot to $19. That's about £10k+ potential gain gone. Then I sold.. Waited and rebought at $20.28... Sold just at the start of the free fall... What a catalogue of comical errors.  Lesson learnt : don't go on a bike ride when you have £50k riding on a risky spac..   Am I doing this right?

jd2h1o|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|39|GME shorts getting confident. This is the best setup for the following short squeeze.  There is always a small breakdown before the real gains happen. This is the best moment to get in before gay bears are massively fucked next week.   We can do it. We just need to hold strong today.  This is the reward next week for your diamond hands today:  We are here https://imgur.com/gallery/VyqEBjf  No pain, no gain. It is just math. It is going to happen if we hold together.   Stay strong and see profits next week which are unprecedented.  Volkswagen happend without this massive community support and the set-up was not even as good as GME for a short squeeze.   This is history happening in front of your eyes. You can make it happen.  We can only make it together retards.|2021-01-15 11:24:55

Trouble is over 20 million shares traded, rest of market is down but still GME price not collapsing.      Yesterday, there were hardly any shares available on IBorrowDesk. Nothing like today. Means only one thing to my pea sized brain: today is make or break: they decided to see how much it would run up yesterday, and hoped the overnight dump would set up the paper handed slide to oblivion.

jcaz6x|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|8|Also I see a lot of posts about all time high it hit in 2008 and 2013. This is no where even close. When they hit 60 twice back then the market cap was almost 10 billion, because the amount of shares outstanding was over 200 million. In order for this to get to the all time high it needs to hit north of 180 a share.   In addition I believe in the long term prospects of this. Ryan Cohen is a genius and took Chewy up against Walmart, Amazon ect. I believe his vision for gamestop is more like a Epic Games online with the stores selling electronics and all types of collectibles ect. The brick and mortar presence will definitely get toned down, but it will make it stronger in the end. There are a few platforms to choose from like Steam and Epic, but they can do better. Steam is good, but their games are over priced compared to the market. Epic had a great campaign over the last few months, but the choice is not great. If they do a combination and undersell the games for just a few percentages they could establish a nice gamer base.  Also do game give away like Epic until the base is built up. In addition you could also sell PS5 and XBOX games where you would have a real leg above the 2 mentioned above. With the deal with Microsoft they could undercut the price by $2-3 for online codes to build a gamer base.   Lastly lets talk about the shorts for a minute. How do you have almost 3 million shares shorted more then are even issued. How is this even legal ?? Every few days they must slowly buy and sell to different accounts in order to do this creative synthetic position. As I write this now I have never seen a stock shorted over the amount of shares outstanding and I have been trading since 1989. The shorts are so stuck in here it's insane. The price of a ticket to join in the fun as of this writing is only 38.22 to participate in the fireworks. I know I want to be in the biggest short squeeze ever. if this falls apart then so be it as I won't risk more than I can afford to lose, but I have a feeling this will be talked about for months.  — Commenter on Yahoo Finance|2021-01-15 07:35:47

jdijua|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|6|Guys about SEC Rule 201. This makes sense. They can only short on an uptick If I understood correctly.  They first crashed the price down and kept it there all day. Look how it never moved above $36!!! Every time it went up, it got shot back down! They must be continuing to short right now. If they didn’t do this, they’d be shorting at open price $38-$40. Each up move instantly shot back down this didn’t look normal. Please correct if me I’m wrong|2021-01-15 13:27:49

When I went to return, it costs even more than the item is worth because they are in China and it’s heavy as shit. The seller also gave me a fake “prepaid” label that isn’t prepaid.   It took way too long for Amazon to fix this. The A-Z guarantee doesn’t work easily when the seller offers you a “full refund” with a fake prepaid label... eventually I got a refund after weeks of back and forth and was told to keep the broken item.   Now the seller is offering me $70 to remove my 1 star review. What’s the play here boys?|2021-01-15 12:21:45

Gme had a huge catalyst with Cohen taking a big stake in the company and being put on the board with other chewy members. Other companies don’t have that luxury and they will continue to just tank. It makes sense to hop on the gme squeeze but bbby doesn’t make sense to me. there’s no catalyst that will make it really squeeze in my opinion.|2021-01-15 06:24:56

I've sold some 1/22 $43 calls on those, just to capitalize on theta and mitigate downside risk. These covered calls also means that my broker can't lend out the shares to any skeezy market makers.   My real "money maker" on this swing is the 50x 2/19 $35c that I also have.  I'd be ecstatic for the 2500 shares to get called away next Friday. It would give me a 30% profit on the shares, and a much higher percent gain on the calls (if we cross $43).|2021-01-15 13:33:57

It will probably just find a level close to where it is now and be sideways. Too many people love the stonk and fear they selling would allow others to jump in and take their future potential profit.

jdu6xt|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|6|Guys-- had a bunch of 26c PLTR expiring 1/15. I was down and hoping for a surge (which obviously didn't happen). But TD Ameritrade sold them out from my hands. I'm not kidding you as the price started to drop an order I had open (my hopeful surge order) was cancelled and a new order was put it at a much lower price. This is an call contract, 2 hours before the market closed, no way TD Ameritrade should be stepping in here right? The contracts can expire worthless and it doesn't harm me at all. This was entirely cash order, PS, no margin involved.  I'm on the phone with them now (after waiting for literally an hour). They low key did save me from worse losses, but lets see if I can maybe get my money back?!?! It should be my decision to lose all my money if I want to. Buy high sell low is my strategy.|2021-01-15 15:00:06

You can add keywords for the bot to look for, create roundups for any subreddit, and change when the roundups are sent to you. Be sure to connect your reddit account in order to import your existing roundups.  [Reply to this message with `daily` to get daily recaps instead]  I tried sending you a roundup, but it was too long for a single message. So I posted it here:  https://reddit.com/r/SubredditSummaryBot/comments/iy9gma/roundup_dump/gjducbf/    If you would like this roundup sent to your reddit inbox every week send me a message with the subject ['wallstreetbets'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&subject=wallstreetbets&message=x). Or if you want a daily roundup, use the subject ['wallstreetbets daily'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&subject=wallstreetbets%20daily&message=x). Or send me a chat with either wallstreetbets or wallstreetbets daily.  ####Please let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/wallstreetbets or if there are other subreddits that you think I should post in.

Speaking in Wilmington, Del., Biden said he’d lay out a plan next month for spending on infrastructure, clean energy, worker training and more.

jd9ddh|kxsd2p|kxsd2p|-4|Hey guys new to the sub, I don't mean to sound like a boomer but I have few questions around the current GME jump. I dont fully understand how this works but from peaking around the subreddit it seems like MM has a huge short position which will become worthless if the stock jumps high enough at which point the will likely hedge their losses by buying stock back to cover the delta number. Why wouldnt MM simply just refuse to buy such a volatile stock. And if everyone is so convinced the stock is going up isnt option trading safer. You can bet a smaller principle and get the same reward. If the stock doesnt rise then you lose 100% of a smaller principle amount rather than upwards of half of the much larger principle incurring a greater loss.   I apologize for the ignorance. I normally would prefer to trade stock in the long term but the current sentiment is that the market is overvalued. I decided I would maintain liquidity with short term option trading so I can cash in and earn some tendies when the current bubble bursts.|2021-01-15 12:17:11
