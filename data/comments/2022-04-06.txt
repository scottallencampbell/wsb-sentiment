She puts a hand softly on your back and asks again, more calmly this time, "What's wrong?" You look up from your distorted, chrome reflection in the bottom of the sink and smile at her. "Nothing. I think it's just my medicine. I'll be fine." She stares at your face for a moment longer, then nods, satisfied with your answer. She returns to the bedroom to get ready for work.  You return to your reflection, and you don't recognize yourself. You didn't exactly lie to her. It's just that the medicine you meant was the bottom shelf vodka you drank last night, not the new anti-depressant she knows you are supposed to be taking. You hate the way vodka makes you feel the next morning, but you've learned through trial and error that people are less likely to smell vodka on you than they would bourbon.  You reach for your phone and see pre-market is still red. All those calls. All those calls. Expiring today. You dry heave again and yell, "I'm fine!" to prevent her from coming to check on you again. After all, you don't want her to see you pouring another drink.|2022-04-06 06:23:12

Can’t have all these housing bagholders, mortgage companies and realtors be in any kind of danger. No way. Everyone’s bought into the “this time it’s different” narrative.

3mjmp2|tximj8|tximj8|6|everyone needs to understand something important.  SPY hit it's ATH very close to when QE peaked. Since QE started tapering SPY started pulling back. The only reason SPY did so well in 2020+2021 was because of QE. Please understand that as it's critical.  Without QE, SPY will never surpass it's previous ATH. It will keep doing lower highs and lower lows. You will be getting relief rallies but it will be a downward trajectory until a recession is behind us.  There are no two ways about this. Arm yourself with that understanding and manage your money accordingly.|2022-04-06 08:54:25

Are you brave enough to cross the line? Are you brave enough to put civilizations at risk?

You have tried to blackmail Russia on energy but it is time you pay a huge price for it. Cross the line, and your children will pay a price even higher. We have always listened to you and wanted to create a constructive dialogue but, unfortunately, you have never heard us. If you try threaten us and our people, you and your future generations will forever regret it.”  Question is: Who is buying calls at open ?|2022-04-06 06:48:30

3nonte|tximj8|tximj8|2|Man, I don't really give a fuck what the markets take from the fed minutes or where they go. The market is not the fucking economy, but its health is dependent on the economy. The economy is running red hot and at a melting point because of inflation and supply chain constraints... but the most they can do is 25-50 BPs? Why do they insist on just kicking this can down the road? The more we procrastinate dealing with this, the worse the result is going to be. Ugh.. makes me fucking sick.|2022-04-06 13:17:07

3nrilh|tximj8|tximj8|2|Here is the important part:        *"Several participants remarked that they would be comfortable with relatively high monthly caps or no caps. Some other participants noted that monthly caps for Treasury securities should take into consideration potential risks to market functioning. Participants generally agreed that monthly caps of about $60 billion for Treasury securities and about $35 billion for agency MBS would likely be appropriate. Participants also generally agreed that the caps could be phased in over a period of three months or modestly longer if market conditions warrant."*        \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_        So basically, theres going to be a cap in terms of how much QT they can do every month. Right now its $60bil worth of Treasuries and $35bil worth of MBS. The caps are there to put a limit on how much they can sell per month in order to keep the markets functioning smoothly. The caps can also be changed at their discretion if market conditions warrant.|2022-04-06 13:34:43

If it weren't for the extremely generous IORB and RRP rates, effective funds rate would have gone negative.  Now at these rates in a little over 10 months $1T will be sucked out from these reserves.

3lzpra|tximj8|tximj8|4|Picked up on some unusual options activity that was shadowed by $TWTR and $SST.        On 4/5 at 9:57AM two unusual options trades caught my eye:         $MNST unusual activity $83c / $88c 4/9 exp    300k in premium on OTM weeklies.        Both trades executed at the same time, so pretty safe to assume the same trader. No comparable put activity. The premiums were executed on the ask side, which is bullish. Didn't see any other activity that would suggest it's a debit call spread. Kept my eye on the ticker all day. No other real activity or news dropped at close.         At 4:30pm 365,186 shares were purchased for $29.9 through a dark pool transaction.         I didn't want to get all excited and think I found something good here, so I've been combing through open source information and throwing the trades around in a few discords and other subreddits seeing if there's a reasonable explanation. Seems like the type of information that would fit WSB degenerates being weekly expirations. Do what you want with this or just ban me for me being retarded.        I took a small gamble on it. Bought 5 87C on the 4/9 exp.         Some folks were looking at the $KO flow and thought maybe it was in relation to coke buy out. Purely speculation.  &#x200B;  (Sorry, tried posting directly, but auto mod being a dick, so it no screen shots of the transactions.)|2022-04-06 06:02:03

I did use E\*TRADE for some GME trades back during the chaos, but I kept some positions on Robin Hood.

3lwbo0|tximj8|tximj8|1|I've heard some describe the market as lifeless. Coldly inorganic. They say its fluctuations seem robotic, random even. But I disagree. To me, the market is very human. That's probably because, despite the ever-growing presence of algos, it remains a reflection of human sentiment and human experience.  To me, no part of the market represents this better than VIX. It reminds me of the way I love my wife. For our mental and physical health, we spend most days with a low VIX. In fact, like UVXY and VXX (before it broke), we're perpetually at lower lows. Every year we've had together, we're more mellow. More settled into coexistence. It gets progressively easier. Less volatile.  But that doesn't mean we're never volatile. And it doesn't mean I don't cherish our volatile times. The volatility spikes come with the most significant moments in our relationship. Usually just *before* a big moment--when fear of the unknown is heightened--like the way VIX rises in the moments before Fed meeting minutes are released.   The first time we kissed. The first time we said "I love you." Every time we have suddenly, wordlessly fucked. Every time we have suddenly, wordfully screamed at each other in anger. When we decided to have a baby, and the violent, magical moment that baby arrived in the world. We were so filled with the terror of wondering if it would arrive with ten fingers and toes--if it would arrive alive. To date, that's the biggest volatility spike on our all time chart. But I don't pretend it will always be the biggest spike. In fact, I hope it's not.  Don't wish for all green days. Don't wish for a slow melt up. Let the market kiss you. Let it wordlessly fuck you. Let it scream at you in anger. Let it take the incredible risk of a near-death dip because that is the only way it will slingshot and birth the child of new, inconceivable wealth--new, inconceivable heights.  Let the market say "I love you."|2022-04-06 05:21:05

3n660b|tximj8|tximj8|1|My fucking 3-day saga with Interactive Brokers continues.  After signing up for an account I was told I couldn't trade margin, couldn't trade options, and couldn't day trade for being too poor.  I re-entered my financial info repeatedly, then one of the times it just magically decided I could do all those things, and approved me.    Now every time I fucking log in I have to use MFA despite using the same fucking computer.  Which wouldn't be so bad except I get a message that they had to log me out for no particular reason every few minutes, even though I'm not idling, so this isn't a timing-out issue.  So in the last 40 minutes, I had to re-login 11 times.   I try to set up an ACH transfer and get it to recognize my bank...I put my bank info in...and it freezes on their 3rd party login.  Then logs me out.  Do it again, same thing. Again. Same thing.  Again, this time it gets my bank to send me the one-time auth code.  Put it in....hangs. Logs me out.  Log back in FIVE more times... the same thing.   Log in the sixth time.  This time clicking the EXACT same link takes me to a different ACH page, and I get through the process. They're supposed to make two small deposits into my checking account....only they never do.    Absolute fucking nightmare.|2022-04-06 11:21:52
