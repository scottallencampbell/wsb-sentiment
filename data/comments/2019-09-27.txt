1mtmwb|d9ystx|d9ystx|21|So just some background info on why this discussion is even happening --  It's a strategy of China (government) to IPO domestic companies -- meaning all the buildings, infrastructure, people, etc are based in China -- in the US stock exchanges. China will hype up and even fake the companies' financial prosperity (keep in mind that China's government is backing these companies so they have unlimited money). This attracts US investors and they essentially throw all their money at these meme growth stocks.  These companies do RAPID expansion of these businesses by building real estate, machinery, infrastructure -- all in China -- basically hard assets that can't be easily liquidated or transferred overseas. US investors continue to throw money at these companies.  When it finally comes out that these companies are frauds, everything comes crashing down. All assets need to be sold off. Who wants to buy all these things in China though? ...oh that's right. The Chinese government scoops up these buildings for dirt cheap; all funded by US investors.

1m7kp0|d9ystx|d9ystx|8|My fellow tea leaf readers, MA's are getting tigher and tighter, the most recent time these were all so clustered together is around April/may 18, where we broke out higher and managed to continue rallying more or less for the rest of the year.  Nov 18 was fairly tight with downward sloping averages and we drilled and then slingshot recovered that pretty much no-one expected.   The only other time MA's were this close together was Nov 16, Trump's election, where again after a false breakdown, we managed to trend higher, exponetially at the end until Jan 18.  So, will we break out again above 3000-3020 from this huge range, or fail finally?|2019-09-27 07:20:07

1n9h1q|d9ystx|d9ystx|9|PLOT TWIST:  Mango blocks Chinese investments BUT declares a national emergency to get a -98bps rate cut until China trade war is settled. Trump gets his war AND rate cuts, and we all get unlimited free Money because we'll be getting **PAID** to take out loans.  Then we all invest our free loan money back into the banking sector, which will inevitably skyrocket, and we get paid stock profits & dividends AND interest from the loans.  Trade wars ***are*** easy to win|2019-09-27 14:20:36

The court basically said "nah, you're a politican deal with it" and now everyone is outraged and she's going to a higher level court and she founded this movement of "stopping internet hate against women" because of it and the media is generally on her side   I have lived in Germany my whole life and after such outrage there have nearly always been free-speech-infringements relatively shortly after. I think there will be new anti-hate-speech laws in Germany or even the whole EU, soon. Short Facebook|2019-09-27 09:26:51

You wanna speculate as to why Treasuries and precious metals have been on a tear? I'll tell you. Big money has zero faith in this administration.  The grand republican scheme is backfiring hard and once they've gobbled up all the saftey plays the indexes are going to crater.  Hard.  The repo market already showing signs that the banks aren't moving money around like they usually do.  Why? Because theres zero faith in this market.

1n0nqa|d9ystx|d9ystx|1|My trade ideas for today:  \- Taking mostly bullish positions because I expect this news to be debunked, but hedging with cheap OTM puts that will be easy 10-baggers if it's confirmed  \- Puts on TLT; Treasuries are being bought up due to Fed's QE and because trade tensions are seen as rising. If the news is debunked, there should be a small dip, and if it's confirmed, there's a decent chance China could retaliate by dumping their US debt which would cause the supply to surge and TLT to plummet|2019-09-27 12:44:49
