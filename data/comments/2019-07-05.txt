sz984d|c9epea|c9epea|17|Okay summary of the day for me:  As some of u know, I stated today that due to the fact I found out about grayscale, I decide to trade using it. Taking all colors out was fun.   I've been following a specific stock for quite some time and was sure it was gonna go up and bought an option at the exact strike price I expected the stock to go over.  My DD worked out and the stock went way past it.  Plot twist, due to the absence of colors I bought a put option rather than a call (had checked puts price on that stock a few days back, and without colors completely forgot about it)  Watched my DD gets more right through the day and my money burn.  AMA  TL;DR : traded without colors, had right DD bought wrong option and lost money.|2019-07-05 15:13:24

sxluhl|c9epea|c9epea|6|> The report ‚Äúwould seem to make a mockery of market expectations‚Äù for a quarter- or half-point cut at the July 30-31 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.     Tell em Bear friend.|2019-07-05 08:11:48
sxncgx|c9epea|c9epea|7|I was expecting a gap up to over SPX 3000 at the start.  But that unemployment report was way too strong; over 200k job gains is a very strong report.  I posted before that my expectations were for a weak unemployment report showing under 100k jobs that would boost confidence in a 0.25 rate cut.  &#x200B;  Now?  How are we 100% sure of a rate cut in July.  All we have is one round of China tariffs.  We didn't get the second round of China tariffs or the Mexico tariffs.  Just feels like a rate cut is unnecessary with much of the uncertainty gone and employment numbers holding strong.|2019-07-05 08:20:44

"Hello, I want to speak to Charles please".   "How can we assist you today, sir"  "Is this Charles? I bought some of your product recently which didn't disclose its investment in Tesla. What the fuck is this shit? Are you trying to bankrupt me?"  "Sir, Tesla's Q2 delivery numbers..."  "I don't care if /r/TeslaInvestorsClub is projecting the stock to reach $3,000 by 2020. Immediately liquidate all TSLA shares for loss and don't ever buy meme shit like that again or I'm taking my $1200 and going to Fidelity"  Schwab said they'll look into the matter and get back to me.

Foreign markets are relatively weak and i believe the next recession will come from forces outside the US. Jpow knows this and knows that any slow down here will capitulate foreign markets.   Good news will become good news again. Strong jobs and growth here tells me earnings wont be a shit show unless we continue on with tariffs bs.

sx4u54|c9epea|c9epea|19|>Reposting this for all to dream about  Year 2045. The 36-year bull market shows no sign of stopping. Ever since the Amendment was passed way back when, President-for-life Donald Trump, now 99, has been pumping the market hard as a tribute to himself when he eventually joins the centennial club.   SPX, which has returned 9% annually for the past 26 years, recently crossed the 28,000 mark. Hard to imagine that was the Dow - now 254,000 - back in 2019.  Where do we go from here? The markets have changed so much that calls cost more now, as traders only expect markets to gap UP, not down. For a 30 delta call I could buy ten 30 delta puts! Grandpa used to say that back in his day, puts cost more than calls. Imagine that! Oh well, guess it‚Äôs all in on FD calls again this week. I hope GoldmanRobin finishes their maintenance before premarket starts..   Decades later (after the merger) they still suck at managing spreads.. but since earnings have to be credited into a brokerage account by law (and traded 10x before withdrawal), avoiding traansaction fees is key.

sxm3xz|c9epea|c9epea|4| Traders still believe the Fed will cut by a quarter point in July even after blowout jobs report     After a blowout jobs report, traders still believe the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month, but less aggressively now.  The fed funds futures market is now pointing to a 92% chance of a quarter point rate cut next month and just an 8% probability of a 50 basis point cut, according to the CME [FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/) tool. The odds for a half point cut in July were 30% before the release of the jobs report Friday. Odds for a quarter point cut were 70% before the report.  The tool is based on futures pricing from live markets and reflect the views of traders placing real bets on the CME exchange.  [Payrolls jumped in June](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/05/jobs-report-june-2019.html) well above expectations as the U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected nonfarm payrolls to rise by 165,000.  The strong numbers came after May‚Äôs big disappointment of only 75,000 jobs added, which raised doubts about the sustainability of the longest economic expansion in history. That May number was revised lower to 72,000.  The June jobs report did give a few data points that traders could say still warrant a rate cut. Wage growth fell short and the unemployment rate ticked higher.

At its meeting in June, the FOMC judged that current and prospective economic conditions called for maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¬º to 2¬Ω percent. Nonetheless, in light of increased uncertainties around the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures, the Committee indicated that it will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near the Committee‚Äôs symmetric 2 percent objective."|2019-07-05 10:10:36

syxx9l|c9epea|c9epea|4|A lot of over thinking going on re: the rate cut, the economic numbers.  Here's what matters, the Fed capitulated to the market in Q4. They did a straight 180 on hikes for poor reasons. Then the market and politicians pressured them to signal cuts if needed.  The Fed is the market's bitch now. Sure, it might play hard to get to feel better about itself. Maybe not cut in a month when the bond market says so. Maybe talk all neutral for show. But if the market wants to thrash down, it knows the Fed will insta-cut. So there is no need for games and to go through those motions.  And if things do get rough, rates will be 0. No point holding anything but equities, unless currencies go Armageddon. And the big players will not try to force the downfall of civilization. That's ROI-.
