f9xyr9|kadem4|kadem4|167|Everybody like "wow what's happening to TSLA?!"  On Tuesday, at the top, TSLA's p/e ratio was 1,287  1,287  Now some of you retards are like "i dunno what that means" but i'll fucking tell you what it means. It means when you buy a TSLA share, it would take 1,287 years of current revenue for TSLA to pay you back for that share you buy fucking today.  let me put that into fucking perspective baby birds. 1,287 years ago was the year fucking 733.  You know what was going on in fucking 733?  The fucking Arab-Byzantine Wars were raging in fucking Byzantine.  Some fucking Chinese dude was dreaming up the concept of gunpowder. But he fucking failed because this shit wasn't invented until like 100 fucking years later.  Some dude was being born who 15 years later would nut in some roman thot and make fucking Charlemagne.  And if that baby, who was to grow up and later nut out fucking Charlemagne, was like "hey buy stock in my business," it would have taken until fucking today, in 2020, for that fucking stock to be worth face value.   fuck tsla and it's fucking 1,287 p/e ratio havin' ass   EDIT: and yes I posted this on tuesday but i accidentally fucking deleted it so im posting it again for the official WSB record|2020-12-10 07:39:35

Short-term risk-free interest rate=0.3% for 3 months; over the option’s three-month life, stock price could rise to $142, or fall to $98.

fb74py|kadem4|kadem4|5|I delivered for DoorDash for all of 30 minutes in college once. Their current payout is completely unsustainable, I'm staying far away from $DASH   1.	⁠To make any significant money, you need to simultaneously deliver for DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub, etc (their competition). Similar to how Uber drivers often drive for Lyft too. This just shows that using DD alone is not worthwhile.    2.	⁠The pay is absolute utter horse shit, before even factoring in mileage/maintenance/wear n tear (these things exist for bikes/mopeds too). Deliverers who are smart enough to factor this in will eventually realize they're roughly breaking even, if they're lucky enough to not be losing money|2020-12-10 12:58:15

fb2o9e|kadem4|kadem4|5|Im trying to understand the price movement on my SPY $400 1/22/22 calls. The below is all from a snapshot in time about 10 minutes ago:  At yesterdays close my contracts were worth $13.17 a piece and they are now displaying as worth $12.78 a piece (-2.96%) at a current underlying SPY movement of +$0.02 on the day.  Theta is -0.0284  Delta is 0.3387  Vega is 1.42  Gamma is 0.0059  Rho is 1.24  Based on a quick estimate, I would have thought the contracts would be worth more at this point in time based on today's SPY movement. Here is my quick estimate calculation:  PreviousClose + (1\*theta) + (delta\*UnderlyingMove) = expected price  13.17 + (-0.0284) + (0.3387 \* 0.02) = **13.14846**  I'm ignoring vega and rho because IV has remained basically the same since yesterday and I don't believe any large interest rate changes have been made so I'm confused why the current value is pretty significantly off the estimate above. Could someone help me understand what I'm missing?|2020-12-10 12:23:02

To put that addition into perspective, every $11 move in the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company would commensurately swing the entire S&P 500 by nearly a point.  "We've never put anything that large into the index before," Silverblatt said.  Edit: take that as you will. I’m buying SPY puts a few months out. TSLA will drag it down right after inclusion  Edit 2: TSLA will be added to the S&P 500 on December 18. Yes that’s right, a Friday. The next Monday will be bloody.|2020-12-10 12:17:46

fa0tyi|kadem4|kadem4|4|# Day 4 of the tattoo-on-my-ass bet:  Another red day, but it looks like we aren't falling fast enough to break that 360 barrier. We will need some big moves today and tomorrow to hit either leg of my straddle bet.  At this rate it looks like I won't be getting that ass tattoo, and you retards won't be getting my $1000. Sucks for you. This tells me I am right, but still a bit early.  If we continue red I will continue diamond handing these positions. But if we see some green today or tomorrow I may have to roll my 12/18 contracts for a loss on Friday. Depends on the action.   [UPPING THE ANTE: If SPY closes below 360 by next Friday I will donate $100 to the top 10 commentors below. If SPY closes above 375 next Friday I will get JPow's face and "Don't Fight The Fed" tattooed on my ass.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6z61n/upping_the_ante_if_spy_closes_below_360_by_next/)  [The Gayest Gay Bear Post in the History of WSB.

fa0ern|kadem4|kadem4|2|I’m averaging down on ARKG calls today... two limit orders in, one for 10% drop, another for 20% drop. This is going to be my play for the next month. Just OTM leaps on Ark ETFs and average down on dips.. just buying one set of 100 contracts at a time, so around $500 per. And I’ll only increase my position if it’ll lower my average price for that contract.   I don’t play with big money in options though. Most of my money is in long term stocks.   I hope to build this position to around 5k principle invested. And am hoping for a 2x return.   Am I delusional?|2020-12-10 08:03:30

fb1mvd|kadem4|kadem4|3|Tesla inclusion into sp.  Every stock mutual fund has a prospectus.  There are two types we need to worry about.  Index funds and benchmark funds.  Index funds HAVE TO BUY and normally their bylaws tell them they have to buy 3 days plus or minus the inclusion dates.  this is going to be about 15% of total TSLA float.  The benchmark funds managers are paid bonuses of how much they beat the SP500.  They don't have to buy shit, just beat the index number for sweet, sweet easy bonus.  So these guys have to decide, buy TSLA so it's future results don't fuck with me, or not buy TSLA and effectively short TSLAs influence on the 500 exchange.  Most managers will not want the risk, so will buy TSLA to remove this uncertainty, but they have no date on when they do.  So if they think TSLA is cheap now vs inclusion price date of 21, then they buy now.  If they think TSLA will fall after inclusion, they buy after 21.    Edit: TLDR: It's all a game of chicken. Tesla can go up or Tesla can go down. Gamble accordingly my autists .|2020-12-10 12:14:52

So even though I've tried to understand what's going on in here I'm an absolute newbie, but I'd like to get into things and have been thinking about investing. Would you recommend investing as a trainee with a budget of ~50€ per month? I really hope this is the right place to ask questions like these.|2020-12-10 11:31:31

fbog0i|kadem4|kadem4|-1|Question of allergic reactions raised on the FDA call.  PFE doesn't look so good.  Essentially they have a label warning people of allergic reactions and lists the ingredients (FDA noted none of which the general public will understand).  Then noted that this will disqualify 10's of millions of Americans who have any type of allergy (effectively).    Sure it's only an emergency approval so they will ask Pfizer to go back and create a study around allergic subjects, but I don't see this getting approved tonight...  My take is at least the weekend...|2020-12-10 15:18:38

This guy broke Robinhood. I just tested this out myself. Robinhood let me sell these retarded box spread hybrids. Only thing that you have to do is adjust the limit price in such a way where the collateral is $0.01 more than the premium. Robinhood will then let you open up these retarded spreads with $1 a piece.
