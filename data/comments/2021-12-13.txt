Somewhere around $100 billion in net addition has flowed into AAPL stock to pump it from $2.5 to $3 trillion.

German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"  **TL;DR** My dog is getting a home if my offer is accepted.|2021-12-13 11:14:42

oezdje|rfd84z|rfd84z|-5|Despite the losses I am incurring today for buying GME for $151 rounded up, I feel I have nothing to lose whichever way this stock goes.  If it goes down, it just means my assets are hidden, and if it goes up, which it inevitably will, I profit.  The way I see it, GME is on sale, as its been a while since its been below $150, and I see this is a risky but profitible buy situation.  Maybe this thing will crash back down to $40-$50 like it did after the first spike; I say bring on the risk!  The upside is high enough for me to risk what I have earned thus far.

If you didn't have money and people had to pay your way to continue their relationship with you, most of your relationships would cease. You would also find that if you didn't have money people would expect tribute in some form or another. Your family, your friends, your marriages are all a facade for a mutually or individually beneficial relationship that reveals at the core of humanity a selfish innate quality of which the whole world is built upon therefore enhancing the intrinsic value of surplus and commodity, which is translatable to, you guessed it, money. Even those who are extrodinary in charitable measures do so for mutual benefit.  If you think that money isn't everything in the existing parameters of the world, it's clear you've never had nothing. Think also, when's the last time you've ever heard someone complain about having too much money? I may play the fool but I know this, money is the most important thing.|2021-12-13 08:54:26
