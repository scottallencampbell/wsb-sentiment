Bourla sold 132,508 shares at $41.94 per share, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late Tuesday.  Pfizer said on Wednesday the sale was part of a pre-announced trading plan, adopted by Bourla on Aug. 19.   Some people have all the luck.

I'm close to doubling my money, and if it gets to that point I'm selling. Silver and SPY had made me the most money over the years. Are you asleep yet?|2020-11-11 11:35:00

Given the money they raised, I believe they will be able to build a hydrogen fuel cell/electric truck sometime next year. I mean give any company the money they got and with enough engineers and partnerships they can pull off a functional truck too.  But Nikola is bleeding cash and never had any new tech from the start.

I expect the dump tm before earnings and then a continued dump after  FWIW ive been long palantir af since the IPO and bought a call everytime i read a fuck ass analyst saying it was overvalued. They announced earnings for Nov 12 on Oct 29 which is around when this run up started-makes sense since earnings are earlier than i would have expected since theyve been public like 6 weeks so they‚Äôre setting the tone that earnings will be good.

bxbta0|js5m7m|js5m7m|6|The best case scenario for the markets is that pandemic still goes on in the background without causing major lockdowns. So that monetary stimulus can keep inflating stock prices and we can have a feint economic recovery.  If pandemic ends, all central banks around the globe will pare off monetary stimulus harshly to have a more manageable inflation in the future. And that's where the crisis ends, stock prices will suffer the damages done during the pandemic and markets will tank.  So finding of a vaccine is not bullish at all. It's only bullish for the most severely affected finance, travel, hospitality, energy and defense stocks and oil prices.|2020-11-11 05:13:42

bylryi|js5m7m|js5m7m|2|On October 12, FSLY hit $136 while NET was hovering around $41. A month later, FSLY is $71 while NET is $65. Whoever predicted that reversal made BANK! I have always maintained NET is superior to FSLY and for the long term, I'll bet on NET. I just didn't expect then to switch so quickly.  P.S. Yes I know share price is different from market cap. But there is still a psychological effect of share price. For example, for a long time, AMD share price was always smaller than INTC but as soon as AMD overtook INTC, it mooned. I anticipate something similar will happen with NET and FSLY.   Thanks for coming to my TED talk.|2020-11-11 12:50:43
