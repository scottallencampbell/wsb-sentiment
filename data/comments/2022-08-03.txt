itoh4e|wf2j3v|wf2j3v|15|Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.|2022-08-03 14:53:10

ishjud|wf2j3v|wf2j3v|10|Step 1. Buy the float.  Step 2. Set a limit sell on your shares to be what you find to be the "fair value" of your shares. If you bought them for $10/share, you saw some value there, so obviously, your limit sell will be about $20,000/share.   Step 3. That is the new price of the stock.  Step 4. Sell for profit.  Step 5. Stop being poor.  EZPZ|2022-08-03 10:12:01

And that thought brings you comfort because you finally found the place you belong, even though that place means you were nothing to begin with. And the only place you feel peace is when your autonomy and personality have been stripped away.  Anyway, I bought puts.|2022-08-03 13:48:37

isb65h|wf2j3v|wf2j3v|5|The reason Tesla isn’t mooning today is because the meeting is tomorrow. Remember when Tesla was as 970ish and FINALLY crossed over 1000 and ran to 1035? But kept going from 1035 - 998 like 10 times ? Then that Friday Tesla announced stock split and it instantly jumped $145 after hours ? After all options that week got fucked, but those that bought 2 weeks out got paid hugely ?   That’s gonna happen again. Probably will go into the meeting at 910-935 and then if the split is approved & a date is set it’ll more than likely cross 1,000 by EOD Friday or possibly that same day & start officially running up Monday for 2 weeks straight, but the first week being the juiciest.   Basically don’t touch rn, buy 0DTE Friday ATM & then sell. Then rebuy for 2 weeks out|2022-08-03 09:30:05

If you have observed the last several sessions, you can see a pattern:  * Dip ~$0-2 at close * Volume more pronounced when reaching new highs, less so when hitting range target * Range target plays out orderly  People are fucking cashing tf out bro. All the volume is selling at new highs. They say they have to gamma squeeze to find an exit basically.

That's where our economy is currently positioned. Hope you retards have generators that operate on propane, EMP defense on your electrical panels, months and months of food stored, a variety of firearms for different scenarios, tons of ammo, access to a well, level 4 body armor, defenses that make your house very difficult to break into, 365° surveillance around your house and property that is hard wired and records to a hard drive, gallons and gallons of gas with stabil in it, and several acres in a rural area. If you don't have all of the above, you will almost certainly die in the next 12 months. Good luck retards|2022-08-03 12:27:56

iry4tn|wf2j3v|wf2j3v|2|this market action reminds me exactly of summer 2020.  So many bearish posts and puts and talking about a retest of a level.  Markets dont give a shit and will keep going higher.  Corporate earnings are still positive yet slowing.  Feed me all the bearish posts while the markets priced all your shit in the last 7 months.  edit: do any of you actually understand what a stock is and what profits/earnings/dividends are?  Do any of you see the American Stock Market earnings declining this year?  You guys are outrageous humans|2022-08-03 07:54:31

I’m continuing to sell into the rally and even sold a small amount of Apple shares (50) today. I’m currently at about 11% cash.

irpc4x|wf2j3v|wf2j3v|-2|GME/AMC collateral trend line!   Today is going to be the day. Last time AMC hit the trend line it was somewhere in the $18.50 range before being smacked down indicating that the $17 ish price is where it should go before being heavily shorted.   GME's trend appears to be somewhere in the $36 range so it will be interesting to watch both of these to see how far they get.   According to the people with this theory, it CAN NOT break the trend line for more than one hour or risk margin call, and I also don't think it can close over the trend but nobody seems to be too sure on this.
