eumh1v|pygmgc|pygmgc|15|After getting into options, reading up on them, and listening to a bunch of podcasts, I THOUGHT buying OTM short-expiry options was a fools’ errand. I mean, the payouts were big relative to my (small) initial investments, but the probability of actually getting a payout seemed too small- “A death by a thousand cuts” I was told.  But then a dude named CuckLord000 told me that true 🦍s buy OTM 0dte options because “scared money don’t make money.” The bigger the better on the bets because nothing gets you more upvotes than a YOLO. So now I’ve cashed out the value of the life insurance policy covering my family, sold our only car, and taken out a second mortgage on our house, so I can let it ride on a ticker he was hyping.

ev2ub3|pygmgc|pygmgc|7|The annual interest on America's debt is $378 billion. A decent chunk of that interest is being paid to the Federal Reserve for bailing out the stock market.   To put that figure into perspective, the 2020 spending on the entire military was $778 billion.   We could revert all spending to 2019 levels and cut the military budget in half, and we would still be running at a huge deficit and digging a deeper hole.   The reason the debt ceiling is important is because Yellen is going to need to auction so, so many fucking bonds and needs to do so ASAP. If you think yields are high now, wait until November.|2021-09-30 10:49:28

evc7hd|pygmgc|pygmgc|6|The biggest problem right now is just valuations are so stretched (we all know this, duh).  Look at MSFT; at $282, you look at the past couple weeks and you're like "wow that's down 7-8%, that's nice".  Then you zoom out 3-4 months and the stock is still up 16-17%.  And ultimately, current valuations are a function of Fed liquidity+government stimulus.  If the punch bowl is going to start to dry up in November and then we start talking rate hikes next year, what kinds of valuations (P/E multiples) can you actually maintain on these big cap tech?  I'm not bearish, but a long sideways period just seems necessary to at least make valuations reasonable.  2-3 months of sideways/downward action like we had in October-December 2018 in that interest rate hike tantrum would make a lot of sense.  Of course, just as big of a problem is there's nowhere else to put money, so if we see bond yields get up to the 2+% range (on the 10 year Treasury), that probably helps too.|2021-09-30 11:53:46

Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, on Thursday defended Fed Chairman Jerome Powell from criticism made earlier in the week by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts. Warren said Powell was a "dangerous man" because he had deregulated the biggest banks over his four-year term and said she would not vote to give him a second term if he were nominated for a second term. McHenry said this criticism was "reckless and unmoored from reality." McHenry said Powell's "decisive action" prevented the worst of the coronavirus pandemic crisis.|2021-09-30 09:40:23

eukyjy|pygmgc|pygmgc|4|Pizza Talk: i'm from NY(not NYC but outside where the ACTUAL good pizza is) so I know good pizza. I went to chicago a few weeks ago, had deep dish from giordanos. Absolutely great, sauce was amazing, cheese was rich, my only gripe was the crust which truly let me down. It tasted like a quiche crust/pastry crust. I was craving pizza last night and honestly the pizza around me in Boston is trash, regardless of what massholes want to tell you. My friend awhile ago mentioned that uno's claims to have originated the deep dish and I remembered that last night and figured it would be interesting to compare the two. To be fair........ uno's crust was exactly what I was expecting giordanos to taste like. Likewise, the cheese and sauce were nowhere near comparable, but man if giordanos took advice from uno's or at least shipped some east coast water to chi-town for their crust the chi-town deep dish might be top 3 pizzas of all time.|2021-09-30 08:41:46

evol1v|pygmgc|pygmgc|0|Hey guys, just wanted to put this on your radar that in the coming weeks or month LifeTime Fitness will be dropping another IPO looking to raise 1 billion to pay off long term debt. This company is complete trash. Trust me I know since I use to work for them until Covid. They asked me and many other talented people to come back for half the salary so that the private investors could get theirs after the lock downs that should of never happened.  To all those who want to short the hell out of a company/stock that completely and I mean absolutely deserves to be shorted to the ground to do so when this is back on wall street. I plan on personally selling everything I own from stocks, bonds and some land i own to prepare to beat this company to the ground. Too be quite honest, I am extremely excited to see SP crash. Then I will email the CEO and tell him “I love you” and I shorted your company. Anyone who worked for this company would know what I meant by “I love you”. Prior to Covid this company started gaslighting hardcore. Failed miserable, obviously. What company blatantly lies to their employees through many means and then say “I love you all” stupid and karma is a bitch. Join us when LifeTime Fitness drops an IPO. Anyone who buys this is a complete fool. Plenty of fools in the market, but no fool can out match the ape army. 😉|2021-09-30 13:19:06
