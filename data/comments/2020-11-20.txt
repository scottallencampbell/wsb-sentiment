PLTR hits $3000/share  2030 - palantir has hijacked all of the military systems on earth and control the nuclear launch codes. PLTR hits $100,000/share  2031 - humanity is destroyed and palantir continues to churn out robots that hunt the remaining survivors. PLTR hits 7.3 trillion energy joules unit/share. Only palantir shareholders are allowed to live and are plugged into an artificial reality where they get to fuck 10/10 models every single day and live on a digital yacht with daily cocaine parties.|2020-11-20 09:59:19

Boeing made a mistake taking the software-to-keep-it-from-crashing approach with a passenger aircraft. Having software tricks to keep the aircraft stable is an accepted risk in military aircraft where you are making tradeoffs in the interest of one performance metric or another. It's not acceptable when you have a couple of hundred souls on board innocent of the controls.

cydb6d|jxn70w|jxn70w|7|LOL imagine YOLOing your student loans on this joke:  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2t2pv9Ky7E/maxresdefault.jpg   'like many young companies, ElectraMeccanica is not profitable and likely won't be for a number of years. The little bit of revenue that ElectraMeccanica has generated - including CA$300,000 for Q32020 - has been from the production of custom-built roadsters. Nonetheless, ElectraMeccanica has increased its losses with its operating loss for the third quarter jumping to CA$8.8 million compared to CA$7.8 million during the same period last year, primarily due to the increased SG&A expenses as well as increased stock-based compensation expenses, and net loss rising to CA$14.9 million compared to CA$5.3 million in Q3 2020 due to the fair market revaluation of the company‚Äôs warrant derivative liability.'  Don't lose your tuition money on what's tantamount to the segways of cars, for a company that makes no profits, has increasing losses, and basically only has a little over 1M in revenue for an entire year.  This could turn on a dime at any moment.  Make profits and bail. 1 billion valuation for this junk? lol. this is absolutely peak autism.|2020-11-20 10:34:26

cxt8pr|jxn70w|jxn70w|13|After yesterday, was thinking of doing a pages long, deep dive DD on QE (stimmi), money, inflation, DXY, gold, stocks, ‚Äòthe coming crash‚Äô etc.      Truth: definition of QE, what it is - no agreement. What are the rules of QE / what can banks do / what they cannot - no agreement. What are the effects of QE - no agreement.   Truth: QE is shifting deck chairs on the Titanic. Iceberg still out there but it is not certain the ship will ever hit it.      Truth: no one has a fucking clue. No one.      Truth: we are almost entirely and utterly dependent on sentiment AKA ‚Äòanimal spirits‚Äô.      That‚Äòs it.      Thank you for coming to my TED talk.|2020-11-20 07:32:01

cyvcx0|jxn70w|jxn70w|7|Dear Diary,  I am flabbergasted that GameStop is not above $13 at the time of this entry today.  I sold a covered call when it was $11.50, and saw it moonshot yesterday up to $12.60. Fearing a short squeeze was imminent, I bought back my covered call for breakeven. No money lost, no money gained.  Today I‚Äôve observed the short squeeze continue bright and early this morning. Upon seeing the price hit levels unseen for weeks, it appears that the MMs, like me, who had also sold covered calls at $13, have artificially beaten the stock down in order to close under $13.   Perhaps the MMs have an ulterior motive with this suppression. I shall eagerly wait and find out next week.  Until then: GME $15.5 11/27 (has crazy volume)|2020-11-20 12:57:47

cygnhj|jxn70w|jxn70w|3|The real $TSLA FOMO boys are investing into the countless number of electric startups that are hoping to become the next Tesla. They can't become the next Tesla. You really think these small companies that haven't been able to manufacture 1,000 cars are gonna compete with automobile giants? As electric begins to grow demand, you'll see the top companies like Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota, Nissan start to increase their output of BEVs. There's more to putting a car on the road than just saying "ZERO EMISSIONS" and poof you're now auto manufacturer. Tesla is the leading innovator in batteries/BEVs and that won't be taken away. If you have $TSLA FOMO, I'd recommend investing into Ford or other companies that have already developed EVs, and have capital to build mass-produced EVs. It's one thing to develop an EV, its another to actually sell enough cars to turn out a profit. Most of these EV companies you see will fail within 2 years.|2020-11-20 11:00:56

cz85k9|jxn70w|jxn70w|5|MY DD ON DRAFTKINGS, TICKER SYMBOL DKNG:  Take a step back from your phone. Think about what‚Äôs happening. Sports are back on TV. People are stuck inside. The upper and upper-middle class has a lot of extra money right now from not traveling and not going out to eat. Online gambling just got legalized in Michigan and Virginia. As someone who has friends in the wealthy suburbs of each state, I can tell you DKNG is about to get flooded with cash come January once the states new measures take effect. DRAFTKINGS is the most well known online betting website, and that‚Äôs was even before the current news regaurding legal betting.  More stimulus money is coming in, which equals more gambling money. Think about all the degenerates who aren‚Äôt able to go gamble at the casino or in Vegas right now. They‚Äôre gonna go to DKNG.  Another analyst raised his price target to $100 this past Tuesday, with it currently sitting at $48. Its an easy options play. I see this at $90 by end of March easily.|2020-11-20 14:42:32

Lets say we used $15k to buy 100 contracts to hold until expiration.  Today SPY 11/20 $300 calls are at the price of 57.40 which gives us a total value of:  #$574,000  no TA, no DD, no need to monitor Elon twitter, just blindly invest in a boring index on a dip and you can secure your retirement.

It's going through a pre-packaged bankruptcy in which the equity isn't to be impacted and all the debt gets rolled into new debt. All the major debt holders are already on board.  There will be an immediate bump upward once the "bankruptcy" is completed within a month or so, and if you're willing to ride it out through COVID for a year or two into a more normal business environment, it could be a 5-10 bagger on the common and also the dividends will return.|2020-11-20 12:30:51

Made a few comments about it last month and I hope people made money with it. Aluminum market rebounding from 2020 lows. 2020 aluminum outlook was already bad pre-COVID. As we come out of COVID and manufacturing (homes, cars, planes) recovers, the aluminium market/price recovers expect AA to get back to the 20s and maybe push for the 40s from 2018. They had a 'meh' earnings in October and gave bad guidance for this quarter but here we are up 50% on the month.  Exciting? No. Tendies to be made? Yep.

Basically, to profit on metal options, you really need a big move.  A small move in either direction will be offset by declining vol.  Just worth noting.|2020-11-20 10:12:05

cy1c7a|jxn70w|jxn70w|-7|PLTR you can stop at 19.99, weekly call holders that do not buy shares should be wiped out...  Reason: If you buy shares and do not sell, there is 1 less seller in the market. 1 less seller to compete against to lower the price... But no, you want your short term tendies. Stop at 19.99, 19.49 or 18.99 depending on which wipe out majority of the weekly call holders! Heck, 17.99 is also fine, I can wait, shareholders can wait... We pump for us to cumulatively make a profit, not for weeklies that contribute nothing to the market cap to get away with short term gains  Edit: Pathetic downvoters are the same retards who panic sell right now, no wonder they always lose|2020-11-20 08:53:00
