In 6 to 9 months, that will change and the rotation will be back into the companies that are high retail/shipping/hardware/employee count/labor cost footprint as they get margin expansion and start crushing earnings results.  Basically, Nancy Pelosi and the rest will load up on AAPL/AMZN/etc. leaps in 5 or 6 months.

It seems that markets may no longer be on the same page as Yellen and other policy makers who insist accelerating price rises will only be temporary.     Data from Europe this morning showed prices rose 4.1% in October from a year earlier, with core inflation hitting 2.1%, a level not seen in nearly two decades. The number, which was well above economist expectations, led to further selling of the region‚Äôs sovereign bonds.

Tech has been between 77-85% of the market growth for the big ETFs. The fed, buybacks, and other factors helped.  We are starting to see consolidation, most runner stocks moving 5% or more, around 80% the last 4 months, have been tech. On average of course.  Some weeks ago banks had decent earnings but most didn't move much or fell flat (or down) with only a handful of exceptions.  This technically should be the time banks breakout but they didn't.

iiaja4|qi9clo|qi9clo|16|R/relationship advice is the best fucking place on the whole internet. I am literally crying laughing right now.   My girlfriend (20F) caught me (18M) doing something disgusting and she now thinks I'm a pervert  We have a great relationship personally except our workloads- she works full time and I work part time and am a full time student, I also play sports quite seriously at college so that takes up alot. I've never dated before her although she has, and I naturally have a much higher libido than her (she probably turns me down 80-90% of the time I try and initiate sex, even if its just making out or me going down on her). We haven't had sex for a week because of work and stuff and I'm usually someone who would ejaculate several times a day (I have super high testosterone because of a medical condition). Neither of us watch porn or anything like that. I had a very sheltered upbringing so I haven't really had an education about what's normal sexually, not that I'm excusing my behavior.  Last night she was in the bathroom showering and i was in our bedroom having just been rejected from sex again. Because she'd got undressed in the bedroom a pair or her panties were on the bed. Idk why this is but I really like it when a girl takes charge in the bedroom, so one of my favorite things to do sexually is for her to sit on my face (we've only done this twice and I basically had to beg). So I picked them up and smelled them (idk why, I was insanely horny) and it smelt of her scent and I basically lost control and started jerking off imagining it was her. About 30 seconds later my girlfriend walked in and saw me masturbating while sniffing her underwear and sitting on the bed.   She went mad, and yelled that I'm a pervert and disgusting and lots of other stuff. I obviously apologized loads because I was in the wrong but she was still mad that I was jerking off when I'm in a relationship and using her underwear to top it off. I honestly hadn't felt that embarrassed since I was a kid, and I went to sleep downstairs to let her cool off. I tried cuddling her first but she yelled at me to go away and said I'm a freak, which I guess is true but still made me cry slightly. I just feel like total shit and a horrible person, I've probably lost a relationship with the girl I want to marry, and whats worse I always thought of myself as a gentleman who'd never do the horrible things we read about men doing on the news but now I've done something horrible as well.  Is there anything I can do to salvage this situation? Obviously I can't to talk to anyone irl about it so strangers on the internet is the only solution. It's just gone 3AM now and I still cant sleep, I sort of feel shaky and anxious like I haven't since I was little.|2021-10-29 08:05:36

iimdza|qi9clo|qi9clo|4|One thing about SPY and QQQ is that they have generally been downtrending for months with money leaving at crucial points, however that didn't stop rallies from breaking upward, so certain elements are literally forcing these to float.  While powell isn't the only reason, the tapering process may be enough on its own to invalidate the other supporting factors and cause spike stairs downward.  Already we had the 10% correction or near in Sept, we got the 9 to 8 channel two weeks ago, and there is a double curved elbow and resistance at $457, this is a zombie etf that's trying to get out the grave but someone keeps hitting it back down with a 457 baseball bat.|2021-10-29 09:32:32

Real economy crashed in September. Market is in the process of catching up. Right now my expiries are Jan 21/2022.*        *China is entering a worse than great depression event as all of their real estate and banking companies go tits up in a cascading failure of bad debt, and their citizenries combined life savings get wiped out as the ghost city investment vehicles lose all value.*        *NBER released a peer reviewed paper saying the economy was in the early days of a recession. Atlanta Fed's realtime GDP now puts Q3 at 0.1% growth. That's well into recession territory, and on the border of depression. I am more confident in my position than ever.*  You guys do you, but shit is falling down right now.|2021-10-29 14:31:51

With news of imminent impact, SPY rises a record 42.0% to hit a new all time high of 69420.   "How can it keep going up!?" exclaimed Burry's prodigy. "Don't you realize? We're all about to die!! This is literally the time to sell! What the fuck!!!!"  A faint voice replies "Not all of us, only the gay bears will die". Can it be? It is! Powell's great great grandson. The living legend himself. The YOLO'er who turned $100 into $100 trillion just by buying weekly SPY calls.   Upon further inspection of the asteroid, it appears that it's actually a giant rocket. There's writing on the side of it... X √Ü A-12 Industries.  Without hesitation, the rocket blows up, sending millions of heat-seeking missiles toward the great USA. Boom! Boom! Boom! One by one, bears are blown to smithereens. The market dips 0.1% and immediately CNBC and WSJ issue press releases that this is the dip we've all been waiting for!

ijeqdw|qi9clo|qi9clo|-3|There was not support at open leading to hops for SPY and TSLA yet strangely something later on pushed both upward. Artificial pump.  If you are smart don't hold, both Tsla and SPY will drop by end of day. (SPY may last a few minutes longer since it trades until 4:15.) Bookmark this post.  This should be obvious since 5 of the last six trading days had that happen to SPY for similar reasons, now TSLA is also on the fumes.   Next week will be red, all resistance levels will push downward. May or may not start on Monday    but the hints will start their regardless as we enter Nov.  We had the Sept correction and this is the end of the last rally expected after that. A rally consolidated to 23 stocks in terms of movement and volume (excluding bots).

I feel like I might never have been able to escape that gaslighting if it weren't for covid so I'm almost thankful to the overlords for it.
