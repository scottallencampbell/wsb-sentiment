This rise followed advances of 0.9 percent in     May and 0.4 percent in April. (See table A.) On an unadjusted basis, final demand prices moved     up 11.3 percent for the 12 months ended in June, the largest increase since a record 11.6-percent     jump in March 2022.        In June, three-fourths of the advance in the index for final demand was due to a 2.4-percent rise     in prices for final demand goods. The index for final demand services increased 0.4 percent.        Prices for final demand less foods, energy, and trade services moved up 0.3 percent in June after     advancing 0.4 percent in both May and April. For the 12 months ended in June, the index for     final demand less foods, energy, and trade services rose 6.4 percent."|2022-07-14 07:31:30

g5fnrm|vys6eh|vys6eh|7|The only true hedge against inflation is housing. People will sell their useless trinkets when the going gets tough. The stocks, the shiny coins, the digital coins, etc. but they won’t sell their houses because they live in them and need them to survive. We have only seen one major housing crash in 100 years and it was specifically because people were being forced to sell their homes by a wave of foreclosures. If people aren’t being forced to sell, they won’t. And they will never sell when the market doesn’t favor sellers, meaning the market only ever favors sellers.|2022-07-14 12:06:46

g5bwpt|vys6eh|vys6eh|4|I'm conflicted.  On the one hand everything in the macro environment is suggesting we're in for a rough 6-12 months.   On the other, mainstream sentiment is so bearish and the put/call ratio is so high that it really does feel like a lot is priced in. After missing to the upside on inflation and not dumping like 5% it seems like most of the sellers are gone barring any black swan events or anything.  War - priced in and any indication that the war is ending should send markets higher.   Inflation - We just had the highest inflation read in decades and no one seemed to care too much.   Defaults - Used car defaults are about to sky rocket.  Earnings - Over the next two months earnings contraction could bring us lower.   I'm torn on what to do.|2022-07-14 11:43:23

g589xr|vys6eh|vys6eh|7|Look at the crash in 2007-2009. Dow topped in October 2007 at 14000. In the next 1 year it slowly drifted lower and lower and it was down -20% a year later by fall of 2008. Many people thought this is the bottom and we already priced in recession and all that. In the next 6 months, shit crashed another -40% and now Dow was down -55% from 2007's high.   We are currently in fall 2008 where people think recession is priced in because stocks are down -20%.

I took my losses and bought otm clov calls and waited for it to “squeeze” (yeah, squeeze my nuts nerd) while every other stock rallied in a huge bull market. Now here I am, with deep otm apple puts.  What have I learned?   Clearly I’m just fucking stupid. Alternatively, if I had went long instead of gambling, I would’ve bought nvda and all these other stocks at the top because I don’t know how to calculate the true valuation of a company.   The conclusion?  I’m going to be a poor forever because some of us will just never learn from our mistakes and that’s the way it is.|2022-07-14 11:04:15

g4f6v1|vys6eh|vys6eh|4|Bulls have this market won until rent stops being paid. Once that happens it's 3 months and we start to feel the cracks in the leveraged players. More money goes to keep those afloat then into the market. 6 months people start to lose houses, interest rates rocket, houses prices have a sharp draw down as more enter the market, those that bought in the last 3 years for an "investment" are upside down and we see a small scale 2008 (like very small) stocks drop 20-30% government loses the game of chicken and lowers rates.  When that happens you take the cash you've been saving and you buy your dream home once it becomes painfully affordable. You need to last 1 year with a painful mortgage. Your home value will rocket as rates decline.  At the 1 year do a cash in refinance. You now have your dream home at half your previous painful mortgage and the home value will continue to grow over the following 3-5 years allowing you to leverage via a heloc into the stock marker which will also be rocketing up on lower rates.|2022-07-14 08:03:13

g5yqdd|vys6eh|vys6eh|3|I’m not a financial expert, but I do know that we live in unpredictable times.  In the 20th century, the elite, through our institutions and our governments, had a monopoly on information.  There was a significant information gap between those in power and the masses.   Due to the internet and social media, the information gap has closed significantly. This caused the elite to lose their ability to control information, the public conversation, and the narrative. This destabilized everything and the elites really don’t know how to accept this new reality while also being able to hang on to their power.  For this reason, I am a bear for now.

g3zsys|vys6eh|vys6eh|1|Hyperinflation  Germany was already suffering from high levels of inflation due to the effects of the war and the increasing government debt.  ‘Passive resistance’ meant that whilst the workers were on strike fewer industrial goods were being produced, which weakened the economy still further. In order to pay the striking workers the government simply printed more money. This flood of money led to hyperinflation as the more money was printed, the more prices rose.  Prices ran out of control, for example a loaf of bread, which cost 250 marks in January 1923, had risen to 200,000 million marks in November 1923. By autumn 1923 it cost more to print a note than the note was worth.  During the crisis, workers were often paid twice per day because prices rose so fast their wages were virtually worthless by lunchtime.   Hyperinflation winners:  Borrowers, such as businessmen, landowners and those with mortgages, found they were able to pay back their loans easily with worthless money.  People on wages were relatively safe, because they renegotiated their wages every day. However, even their wages eventually failed to keep up with prices.  Farmers coped well, since their products remained in demand and they received more money for them as prices spiralled.  Hyperinflation losers:  People on fixed incomes, like students, pensioners or the sick, found their incomes did not keep up with prices.  People with savings and those who had lent money, for example to the government, were the most badly hit as their money became worthless.|2022-07-14 05:34:45

If you have the time, watch for a shift in the algorithms at some point today.  Could be in the 10:00am hour or could be mid day or could be in the final hour.  I do not know.  But we will have a push out of red at some point.  The Machines will not allow for a sell off at these levels.|2022-07-14 06:59:49

Rates are subject to change without notice. Rates, points, and APR will vary based on loan amount, credit score, lock period, LTV, property type, loan type and loan purpose. Loans with LTV ratios above 80% may have higher APRs and will require Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). Homeowner insurance required. Flood insurance may be required.

Subject to credit approval. ** ARM= Adjustable Rate Mortgage; The APR, interest rate and principal and interest payment for ARM loans are subject to increase and will change after the initial period due to market-driven changes to the index. The ARM rate index is the 30-day average of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The featured ARM rate above is locked in for an initial period of 60 months and will adjust every 6 months thereafter, subject to periodic caps.  The maximum interest rate for the life of the loan is the initial rate + 5%; the maximum interest rate at first adjustment is the initial rate + 2%;  the maximum interest rate for periodic adjustments is 1%.|2022-07-14 13:46:33
