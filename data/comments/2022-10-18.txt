The former creates the volatility you fear and the latter calms the markets.   One thing is right about the diamond hands, in undervalued products it creates the fuel for upwards price action.   The problem about this market is still the same as it has been since the corona ‚Äúcrash‚Äù, the gap between the most overvalued enterprises and the undervalued enterprises within the sp500 itself is huge!! If you buy or trade them etfs you still maintain the exact same gap!!! You keep the problem.

ssyzbd|y72psy|y72psy|0|Last week's lows should hold for a couple more weeks.        Retail was buying more puts than ever before at the highest put:call ratio recorded (for retail) into last week's CPI report.   The retail ratio reached 3:1, which wasn't even reached during the 2008 crisis. Yes we were in an asset/inflationary bubble and everyone knows it, but this is a classic counter-trend move against retail put buyers.        Late put buyers get absolutely hammered by this reversal and move up in markets. But typically the final bottom comes well after the peak in put buying as we've seen historically.        Next 6-8 weeks, we likely move higher as the election passes and with a likely end of year Santa rally. Retail will begin to turn bullish (too early), and then we get the final lows in the first half of 2023.|2022-10-18 09:07:21
