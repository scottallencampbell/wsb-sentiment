ah7au1|e95q0u|e95q0u|3|What even is this:  > The side bet on Celgene‚Äôs pipeline created by the company‚Äôs acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb has been soaring in recent weeks. In a note out Wednesday, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed, who is closely following the side bet, laid out what investors should watch for over the next few months.  >The side bet, a contingent value right that trades under the ticker BMY.RT, is up 31.1% since Nov. 21, the first full day of trading after Bristol-Myers (ticker: BMY) closed the acquisition of Celgene. If the upcoming catalysts identified by Syed swing in the CVR‚Äôs direction, the price should climb higher.  >The long, slow acquisition of biotech Celgene by pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers led to the creation of the CVR, a short-term artifact of the deal that‚Äôs now of intense interest to health-care investors. The instrument pays out at $9 if three Celgene assets achieve approval from the Food and Drug Administration by certain target dates.  >As Barron‚Äôs Andrew Bary has written, the CVR is a binary trade. If even one of the drugs misses its target date, the security is worthless.  >https://www.barrons.com/articles/a-side-bet-on-celgene-drugs-can-keep-climbing-51576078390?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo  Straight up Wallstreet parlay?|2019-12-11 10:12:37

ah0282|e95q0u|e95q0u|2|So if i sold a put on SPY, technically itm at 314.50, exp today, and its break even was under 314, it stands to reason it wont be exercised right? Assuming we stay above 314?  My spread reads a break even significantly higher, i assume due to the put i bought as cover, but realistically a spread wont get exercised if the sold option remains otm correct?|2019-12-11 08:52:25

ah0hru|e95q0u|e95q0u|2|Man... I feel like I got super cucked and I really don't understand why. Had 1900 shares of MRNS at 1.15 cost average, they announced a public offering yesterday AH (but without the share price/volume), and the stock tanked. I sold my shares at 1.20 or so, which I thought was reasonable, got out with some profit. Then they announced, this morning, that the offering price would be 1.25. OK. And now the stock has surged to... 1.72? What am I missing? Wouldn't this lead to stock dilution? How the fuck does it have this kind of value?|2019-12-11 08:57:36

ahkz6v|e95q0u|e95q0u|2|Noob question here--why would MMs intentionally crush options premium around expiration dates? If they sold the call/put contract already, why do they care about what happens with the contract premium after it's left their hands?  EDIT: I worded this poorly. My bad. Not asking about theta--I get that. Asking why would MMs crush a stock's actual price in order to keep premiums down (or kill them entirely) on the expiration date.  EDIT 2: I think I worked it out and concluded I'm an idiot. I think what I was fundamentally missing is who owns the shares once a contract is sold/bought. Assuming its the contract writer (i.e. the MM in this case) then it's in their best interest for the actual share price to not go against the direction of the premium they collected hence why they would intentionally try to control share price around expiration.|2019-12-11 12:13:09

agpnir|e95q0u|e95q0u|1|Theta gang, what are you doing today with Lulu? I'm looking at strangles, maybe 20 delta, Friday expiration. Might sell some put premium in Jan expiration, too  The reason I ask is I have never traded this thing and see its had retard strength this year. Option pricing seems fairly balanced with a bit of negative skew. Not sure I want to trade naked in a product this big so also considering a Jade lizard  to cap up the upside risk.  Thoughts?|2019-12-11 06:22:52

ah1qhn|e95q0u|e95q0u|0|What do you think about the Fed Funds Rate Decision? Will they raise the rate or leave it alone? Consensus is that they'll leave it alone, but given the core inflation rate has been over 2%, I won't be surprised if Powell gets some balls and raises it by 25-50 bps.|2019-12-11 09:12:10
