727l07|j1whna|j1whna|10|I read an article that suggests if Pelosi announces a formal vote on her 2.4T bill, that means her negotiations with Mnuchin failed and you should SELL SELL SELL because ain't no stimulus gonna happen.  On the other hand if she is hesitant to pick a day for voting on the 2.4T bill, that likely means progress has been made in negotiations and we can expect to see a roughly 1.5T stimulus later on. In which case BUY BUY BUY|2020-09-29 09:11:46

When 2008 Financial Crisis hit, they bankrupted the original GM even tho they got a bailout. All shareholders lost everything and shares became worthless and if you wanted to, you buy back into GM-A again...which was a new Corporation at the time. Of course they've since changed their ticker back to GM. F them.   Yes. I'm still salty about that.|2020-09-29 09:41:25

72jna4|j1whna|j1whna|31|The year: 2074.  I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. That's when the joy left. That's when hope left.  I'm not a religious man, but I sometimes allow my mind to slip away into pleasant things. I imagine holding her again. I run my fingers through her strawberry-blonde hair. Maybe it's in heaven, maybe it's not. I don't believe, but pretending that I do makes me feel like me again, if only for one fleeting moment.  I turn on my neuralink and close my eyes. I flip through old pictures. It's her. I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.  I open a browser and check the market. SPY 333. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down, but it always finds it way back to 333. It hasn't moved in decades now, it would seem. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days. When I was happy. When she was here.  Sitting alone in an empty room, I let out a broken whimper: "market flat... and gay."|2020-09-29 10:36:44

726iel|j1whna|j1whna|2|I posted most recently about SRNE yesterday (again, been long on it pre-5/15), and here we see it exploding again today.     STI-AMG is the first development the world has come up with as a potential "one-shot cure" for COVID.  The company has yet to receive OWS / government $$ / other funding, but STI-AMG might change that.  Moreover, since SRNE already has their IND and trial approved to start testing their other antibody (1499) on people, it shouldn't be that hard for them to put together the IND for AMG since both antibodies were studied in the same preclinical data (which is what was published late last night).|2020-09-29 09:03:13

Holding an 11c 10/30 VALE. Bought AAPL $135c 9/18 on 9/1.  Folks, start following me because I am a clear indicator to perform the exact opposite.|2020-09-29 12:57:57

72zns3|j1whna|j1whna|1|POOTTT!!! NOVAShares of Sunnova Energy are moving lower after Spruce Point Capital Management issued a short report on the company predicting up to 88% downside in the shares. Sunnova is a "specialty finance company with undifferentiated offerings that operates in a competitive industry facing secular headwinds," Spruce Point said in a report posted on its website. Management "masks its poor and unsustainable economics with potentially misleading and assumption-based non-GAAP metrics and aggressive accounting," the firm known for short selling added. Spruce Point put a price target of $5 to $8 on the shares. Sunnova Energy in early trading is down 7.5%, or $2.00, to $24.74.
