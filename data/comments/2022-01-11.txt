s8jwpi|s1adf5|s1adf5|15|I loaded VXX shorts moments after JPow walked in with his purple Calvin Klein narrow tie he got at Men’s Warehouse for $49.99.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nEVZJQob_5w  The only other time he wore the same tie was on May 1st, 2019 when trade war tensions were at an all time high with China.  This would lead to mango banning Huawei from buying vital parts and equipment from US companies just a few days later.  The market reacted to this and SPY absolutely tanked.  However, the S&P made a V shaped recovery to all time highs by June.  ______  By wearing this neck tie, JPow is sending us a subliminal message that things are going to be tough before it gets better and that he is prepared for what’s to come.  And sometimes JPow doesn’t wear a tie. By wearing one he is showing us his commitment to maximum employment.  He is also signaling that he has not forgot about inflation and supply chain issues. The same tie is now $69.50 plus tax.  ______  Either that or I need to lay off the booze and get some sleep.|2022-01-11 12:12:43

Everyone tries to pre-empt everyone or so the thinking goes, except historically this just never happens.  The street really, really doesn't like cash.  They don't get paid for holding cash.  No client cares that risk of unknown ruin was removed for a guaranteed loss when optimistic competitors made money.  Lose money when everyone else does?  No big deal, "no one else saw it coming."

s7gt15|s1adf5|s1adf5|11|Seeing the vice chair of the Federal Reserve initiate their letter of resignation on January 10, 2022 for January 14, 2022 is probably a bad sign. Didn't even give 2 weeks notice. I think shit's gonna go down.     "**Before the pandemic arrived on our shores in March 2020, the U.S. was in the eleventh**   **year of a record economic expansion**, with inflation running very close to our 2 percent   longer run objective, unemployment at 50-year lows, and wages rising—and rising fastest   at the lower rungs of the income ladder. An elusive ‘soft landing’ was visible on the   horizon, and Federal Reserve policy decisions in 2018 and 2019 helped to put the US   economy on a glide path to that welcome destination.   **Since then, the Covid pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in lives lost and**   **suffering inflicted, and in 2020 triggered a catastrophic collapse in economic activity and a surge in unemployment.** I am proud to have served with my Federal Reserve   colleagues as we, in a matter of weeks, put in place historic policy measures that, in   conjunction with fiscal policy, steered the economy away from depression and that have   supported a robust recovery in economic activity and employment since. There is still   road left to walk and damage to be repaired. But the American people and US economy    have time and again—both in this crisis and those that have come before it—   demonstrated remarkable resilience, tenacity, and ingenuity, and I am confident that once   the process of reopening is complete, a welcome return to maximum employment and   price stability awaits."     tldr: before pandemic, we were looking great. after pandemic, we're fucked. good luck, i'm out.     https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/other20220110a1.pdf|2022-01-11 08:03:11

s7gpuz|s1adf5|s1adf5|15|Congress grills jp about why they almost lost money yesterday. JP is all nervous and sweaty, stammers some crap about "transitory but still need a rate hike" and all. AOC feels sorry for him and tries to help him out by saying some ridiculous shit like, "well, maybe stonks don't JUST go up." The old geezers in Congress boo her down, bc they're all jealous they can't make up their losses by selling bathwater and fart jars like she can. Biden demands his 10%. Pelosi orders JP to turn in his federal reserve issue nametag and hairnet. Then in her best dt impersonation, she says "You're Fired!" JP throws his federal reserve issue nametag and hairnet onto her podium and storms out flicking everyone off and yelling, "You can't fire me, I quit!" On his way out the door, he turns on the money printer full blast and breaks off the key in the ignition. Money prints forever, stonks go up. Biggest bull market ever. The end|2022-01-11 08:02:31

s8m8e2|s1adf5|s1adf5|9|Sweet mother of god.  GME just passed the Triple Lindy line of Demarcation - AKA the Line of the Treaty of Tordesillas.   This means GME will be dropping at triple the rate it had previously and not even the Pope can change it.  The only way to fix this downward spiral is for apes to place buy orders at triple the current price.  Not the current price- but triple the price.  this is known as the "latter, not the former" strategy.  To keep the price stable you'll need to institute this strategy along with buying long-dated deep OTM calls to drive up the gamma radiation.  This is known as a "long latter assault" - this is the only way to fuck the hedgies.   EDIT- WTF is wrong with my fullow apes?  I'm looking at the order book and NOBODY is placing bids at $380.  WTF?

s7y46t|s1adf5|s1adf5|5|These meetings are always bad for the markets, but at least every time they happen, I see a few 22 year old progressives grow a wrinkle and start to change into a more grown up form.  OF COURSE we want stonks to only go up, of course.  Prosperity benefits everybody and wealth cures a lot of problems.  But MAYYYYBEEE if we just put one of these meetings with all this shoehorned diversity soapboxing on loop as the only TikTok or YouTube video anyone can see for a month and let the market take one big dump, we can be done with all of this insane social policy obsession at the expense of a functioning economy forever.  Maybe making lots of money and not having to put up with literally everything in life being worse  but having to put up with mean tweets won't be viewed as so bad.  -Louis CK|2022-01-11 09:59:36

s955ip|s1adf5|s1adf5|1|i’m not sure how up to date you are on the whole CZOO situation but Amazon is heading for bankruptcy and CZOO is now their biggest competitor.  market cap isn’t there yet, but the company plan is on track.  also Jeff Bezos is the target of every major corporation now.  Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated.  Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming.  CZOO is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming.  this CZOO earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and i believe Amazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to CZOO.  so what do they have to do with each other? competitors and CZOO about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.|2022-01-11 14:22:19

s73juc|s1adf5|s1adf5|0|For the retards downvoting this like I wrote this myself.  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20220111a.htm  January 11, 2022  Nomination hearing  Chair Jerome H. Powell Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.  Share  Watch Live  Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I would like to thank President Biden for nominating me to serve a second term as Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I would also like to thank my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System for their dedication, perseverance, and tireless work on behalf of the American people. Their commitment and expertise were essential to the Fed's response to the COVID-19 crisis and remain vital to the implementation of monetary policy as our economy continues to progress. Particular thanks go to my wife, Elissa Leonard, and our three children, Susie, Lucy, and Sam. Their love and support make possible everything I do. My five siblings are all watching, and we are thinking of each other and of our parents today with love and gratitude. Four years ago, when I sat before this Committee, few could have predicted the great challenges that would soon become ours to meet. On the eve of the pandemic, the U.S. economy was enjoying its 11th year of expansion, the longest on record. Unemployment was at 50-year lows, and the economic benefits were reaching those most on the margins. No obvious financial or economic imbalances threatened the ongoing expansion. But this attractive picture turned virtually overnight as the virus swept across the globe. The initial contraction was the fastest and deepest on record, but the pain could have been much worse. As the pandemic arrived, our immediate challenge was to stave off a full-scale depression, which would require swift and strong policy actions from across government. Congress provided by far the fastest and largest response to any postwar economic downturn. At the Federal Reserve, we used the full range of policy tools at our disposal. We moved quickly to restore vital flows of credit to households, communities, and businesses and to stabilize the financial system. These collective policy actions, the development and availability of vaccines, and American resilience worked in concert, first to cushion the pandemic's economic blows and then to spark a historically strong recovery. Today the economy is expanding at its fastest pace in many years, and the labor market is strong. As always, challenges remain. Both the initial shutdown and the subsequent reopening of the economy were without precedent. The economy has rapidly gained strength despite the ongoing pandemic, giving rise to persistent supply and demand imbalances and bottlenecks, and thus to elevated inflation. We know that high inflation exacts a toll, particularly for those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are strongly committed to achieving our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. We will use our tools to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. We can begin to see that the post-pandemic economy is likely to be different in some respects. The pursuit of our goals will need to take these differences into account. To that end, monetary policy must take a broad and forward-looking view, keeping pace with an ever-evolving economy. Over the past four years, my colleagues and I have continued the work of our predecessors to ensure a strong and resilient financial system. We increased capital and liquidity requirements for the largest banks—and currently, capital and liquidity levels at our largest, most systemically important banks are at multidecade highs. We worked to improve the public's access to instant payments, intensified our focus and supervisory efforts on evolving threats such as climate change and cyberattacks, and expanded our analysis and monitoring of financial stability. We will remain vigilant about new and emerging threats. We also updated our monetary policy framework, drawing on insights from people and communities across the country, to reflect the challenges of conducting policy in an era of persistently low interest rates. Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve important goals and has given us considerable independence in using our tools to achieve them. In our democratic system, that independence comes with the responsibility of transparency and clear communication, to keep the public informed and enable effective legislative oversight. That duty takes on even greater significance when the Fed must take extraordinary actions in times of crisis. In order to facilitate that transparency, and to earn your trust and that of the American people, I have made it a priority to meet regularly and frequently with you and your elected colleagues. I commit to continuing that practice if I am confirmed to another term. The Federal Reserve works for all Americans. We know our decisions matter to every person, family, business, and community across the country. I am committed to making those decisions with objectivity, integrity, and impartiality, based on the best available evidence, and in the long-standing tradition of monetary policy independence. That pledge lies at the heart of the Fed's mission and is one we all make when we answer the call to public service. I make it here again, with force and without reservation. Everything we do at the Federal Reserve is in pursuit of the goals set for us by Congress. I am honored to have worked in service to those ends since I joined the Fed in 2012, and as Chair for the past four years. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.|2022-01-11 06:03:27

s8e0wq|s1adf5|s1adf5|-1|In October of 1929 when the market began to cave in people became convinced that the big buyers would come in and support the market because they couldn’t tolerate a crash. And they tried. but the market still crashed anyway because markets aren’t designed to be organized and manageable by a few participants, you need people with cash to believe in it and continuously buy. Once confidence is gone you can’t just restore it because you don’t want markets to go down. Yet people are so sure that all it will take is the fed to walk back it’s rhetoric to restore confidence because the fed wont tolerate a crash 🤔|2022-01-11 11:37:11

s8f0ln|s1adf5|s1adf5|-6|Another day of wsb ignoring BCRX.  Go look at the chart and see what you are missing out on. The DD there is solid. This is a company that even the worst case scenario should be $25+ in the near future. Best case scenarios have it in 3 years at $1,000+.  But sure, waste your time instead trying to squeeze GME. Maybe it does squeeze or maybe not. The massive short interest and clear undervaluation based on solid fundamentals of last year are not there anymore. Retail owns that stock and no idea what that means for a squeeze potential, but with BCRX you have a deep solid play that if you buy and hold for a couple of years has a good chance of making you 10-50X returns.|2022-01-11 11:43:04

s8jcwl|s1adf5|s1adf5|-13|My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.|2022-01-11 12:09:22

s8vna9|s1adf5|s1adf5|-9|Ok, for the AXSM doubters, or are just afraid of pharmas, even though every developing pharma has their own unique circumstances, call Axsome Therapeutics human resources department and ask them if they are still taking applications for sales and marketing for AXS 05 account managers. Also, ask them if they are hiring in manufacturing and distribution.  THEN BUY THE STOCK!!!  If management was still concerned about the manufacturing of their drug they would not be hiring. They would not have increased their credit line for expenses related to both, manufacturing and sales and marketing of a drug that is expected to be a genuine blockbuster.  This stock has a 16% short interest and getting ready for a "resolved manufactuing issues" headline that will launch it to $50 followed by "FDA approves AXS 05" that will rocket it another hundred bucks.  Every day that passes is one day that you hold back and trade other equities, yes. And that's good if you're making money. But, every day that passes is also one day closer to those headlines coming out and folks missing this ultimate YOLO trade.  I'm not holding bags. I'm profitable. I'm in from the $20s on most of my shares. I've also purchased an additonal 50% position and sold calls against them to earn while I wait.  The honest truth is, I write about this because I am a nice person that has been trading for years and this is the second best story I've ever found.
