It's also Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Turkey, and a variety of African countries as well that have condemned this invasion.

Inflation running hot.   the s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued.     China's market has been struggling for the last year.   Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value.   The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite.   Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic).   Supply lines are weak.    Russian economy has gone down the shitter.    AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.       Bull cases:    WW3 might not happen.    Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-03-01 07:04:26

yxr9bn|t45eh0|t45eh0|7|Listen, I will fully admit I have never traded in a bear market. Wasn’t even cognizant of what the fuck the stock market actually was the last time we had one.   I was playing RuneScape at the time, so I did have a basic understanding of trading and economics, but that was as far as it went.   What I *do* know, from what others more experienced than I have told me, is that if this does really pan out to be a full on bear market it is extremely common for us to go on massive rallies only to then dip lower.   That’s what really crushes people. They stop believing any rally will hold. Now, we might straight rally from here, I personally highly doubt it with the fed’s actions looming.   I think any chance of a less aggressive rate hike policy is a joke, they’ll probably be more aggressive if anything. I’m not a fan of buying puts on indexes though. Just DCAing the whole way down and whole way up.|2022-03-01 11:47:45

yy81fh|t45eh0|t45eh0|2|Jerome splashes water on his face in a seedy hotel bathroom and straightens his tie in the mirror, his right eye twitches a few times. He gives himself a shake and steps out of the bathroom. The scene is grim, needles and bongs litter the sleazy hotel room not to mention all the condoms and semen everywhere interspersed with the most rancid whores imaginable, the kind 2scoops would hire. All the Fed presidents, women included, just ran the biggest drug fueled train on the market imaginable. The market is whimpering in the corner about shrinkflation while jizz leaks out of every hole. Once the condoms ran out everyone just fucked the market raw, he smirks as he remembers the market begging them not to. Several of the other junkie prostitutes are passed out about the room and he has to step over them on his way out. It won't be long before they start to wake up and find the pile of dead chinese ones with Evergrande branded on their asses in the bathroom tub. Jerome walks over to the market and bends down and whispers, "Come back when you need more QE, bitch." and spits in her face. Smiling as he walks out he remembers he needs to return some video tapes. He heads down to the hotel office to pay them 9 billion dollars for the hotel stay on his fake CC under Hunter Biden's name. "What about black unemployment?" he says out loud on his way down, mimicking Janet Yellen's raspy old woman voice and laughs to himself.|2022-03-01 13:35:11

You are probably looking at futures thinking “this is it!!” But I can assure you. This is not it. It has not been it since November 11th or whenever we began selling off. There is more money to be made randomly shooting up 5-10 dollars on soul crushingly dismissible news and stealing the money from you then there is to be made just selling off.

yww6da|t45eh0|t45eh0|-10|so i have a bit of a distressing news  I am friends with some people in military intelligence. I have been told that basically nobody in the sigint community thought Russia was going to invade Ukraine. And it had to do with the force structure they had put into place in Belarus and Eastern Ukraine.  They basically were throwing random battalion elements together from all over the Russia far east and Siberia, that made no sense from a logistical purposes and not moving entire brigade combat groups. It is the equivalent of throwing a bunch of random cats and dogs together and calling it an army and deciding to march to war with it. No western analysts thought Putin was serious because he would put himself into a logistical nightmare if he invaded with the force structure he had. And intelligence people thought his officers would tell him this was crazy. But he went ahead and did it. This is also why his army in Crimea is doing better in the south because they are army brigades element structured in a way that made sense, and why his army is jammed up in the north, because it is literally random military elements that have never worked with each other before getting lost in the woods with no flanking/support/logistical consistency.  So the good news is that there was probably no collusion with China so Taiwan is probably safe for now.  The bad news is that the guy who sits behind the red button with the most ready to launch mobile ICBMs on the planet may be senile.|2022-03-01 08:16:02
