z1aspp|t4xq2e|t4xq2e|22|DAILY REMINDER THAT THERE IS NO BULL CASE RIGHT NOW.  Stay in cash gang bois!!!  Bear cases:  Bond yields dropping off a cliff. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. the s&p500s and s&p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite. Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter.    OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.     AAPL, TSLA, AMD and NVDA are carrying the entire market on their backs.   Bull cases: WW3 might not happen. Stocks are still reporting favorable earnings.|2022-03-02 05:06:57

z2tsrz|t4xq2e|t4xq2e|8|Honestly Powell crushed the bear case today. Very clear he won't do anything at all about inflation, unless persistently higher CPI forces him to. Doesn't even suggest selling MBS to slow house price growth  But also pretty clear that CPI and wage gains will get worse and worse. So now we wait to see what the numbers bring. He's just a coward at the end of the day. Doesn't want to be blamed for causing any disruptions, so chooses to do nothing instead|2022-03-02 12:10:09

Did the fed announce lower/less rate hikes? no  If any of #1-#4 are no then the rally you are seeing is a fake rally and you're being suckered into being a bagholder by people wanting to dump their shares.

It could also be his wife is leaving him or he's been diagnosed with cancer or whatever else usually happens to a man in a mid life crisis.    People compare him to Hitler.  Hitler was loud, fiery, forceful, and full of confidence in his delusions.  A man completely in charge.

z3aolh|t4xq2e|t4xq2e|-4|bErs looked at the giant bags in his hands and felt healthy.   He walked over to the window and reflected on his derelict surroundings. He had always loved dumb WSB with its ashamed, arrogant autists. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel healthy.    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of BuLLs . BuLLs was a thoughtful animal with short elbows and skinny mouth.   bErs gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a ruthless, witty, tea drinker with curvy elbows and wide mouth. His friends saw him as a silly, silky saint. Once, he had even rescued a mute puppy from a burning building.    But not even a ruthless person who had once rescued a mute puppy from a burning building, was prepared for what BuLLs had in store today.   As bErs stepped outside and BuLLs came closer, he could see the diced glint in his eye.    "Look bErs," growled BuLLs, with a down to earth glare that reminded bErs of thoughtful blue bottles. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a hug. You owe me 7521 euros."    bErs looked back, even more unstable and still fingering the giant bags. "BuLLs, bUT iNFlaTiOn," he replied.    They looked at each other with lonely feelings, like two late, large lizards rampaging at a very selfish birthday party, which had classical music playing in the background and two lovable uncles pooping to the beat.    bErs studied BuLLs's short elbows and skinny mouth. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained bErs. "You will never get your money."    "No!" objected BuLLs. "You lie!"    "I do not!" retorted bErs. "Now get your short elbows out of here before I hit you with this giant calls."    BuLLs looked sleepy, his wallet raw like a putrid, prickly puts.   bErs could actually hear BuLLs's wallet shatter into 7521 pieces. Then the thoughtful animal hurried away into the distance.      Not even a cup of tea would calm bErs's nerves tonight.|2022-03-02 13:57:34

z2wyfn|t4xq2e|t4xq2e|1|$REGI 03/18 $60 puts look very cheap. IV is very low. Yes, I know $CVX is in the process of buying out REGI at $61.50. But that is not complete and not planned to be completed until 2H22. There really is no incentive for REGI to go any higher $61.50 at this point and I doubt people are going to want to hold until 2H22 to make the small profit vs just selling right now. REGI is currently following the overall market trend, so if we see a drop in the market it will likely follow the trend. What is your opinion?|2022-03-02 12:29:57

Russia has plans to sever undersea fiberoptic cables, if pushed too far I'm sure they'll do this before nukes...
