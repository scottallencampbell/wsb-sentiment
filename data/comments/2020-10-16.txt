90ttqk|jc7ao5|jc7ao5|8|The fed has realized that they can keep pumping out the bailouts to the big boys in the boomer 401(k)s, perpetually. Well, until there aren't assets sold, labor unutilized, and value destroyed in equilibrium, somewhere else in the economy.   They aren't worried about inflation or having to hike taxes to pull money out of the system. Asset value deflation pulls money out, makes it illiquid, sometimes "storing" liquidity until market conditions return to more productive arrangements.   When labor is unemployed, it burns through savings and suppresses wage growth by looking for work. Often, we have to rely on family or friends, and being unable to generate enough income to provide for ourselves, we act, effectively, as a debt burden, which is anti inflationary.   High weekly unemployment numbers is good news for stonks. High restaurant closures and small business bankruptcy is good for stonks. A politician actually trying to do something to stop it? That's bad for stonks.   Imagine if Bernie got that $2000/month plan passed? All those houses that are gonna get foreclosed on, all the small shops and family owned stores that are gone for good, all the lives completely derailed, for this; but stonks go up.|2020-10-16 12:42:03

"He added that current valuations were an example of “stock market failure” driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time.

902mzn|jc7ao5|jc7ao5|2|So - quick thoughts on what we have seen so far with NIO - the few times it pushed past 29 it quickly consolidated and seems to be coiling around in the mid to low 28s. MMs/Algos have set their bands for it right now. I honestly think we have hit the next plateau and won't see another spike until a run up on earnings or another upgrade from a major firm. Call holders should exit before IV crush with earnings but buy back in for longer calls afterwards.  Edit: If you are a long term call holder (say Jan on out) and are fine with riding the waves then it is a hold until earnings IMO|2020-10-16 08:49:30

905ay9|jc7ao5|jc7ao5|1|Repeating myself -    So - quick thoughts on what we have seen so far with NIO - the few times it pushed past 29 it quickly consolidated and seems to be coiling around in the mid to low 28s. MMs/Algos have set their bands for it right now. I honestly think we have hit the next plateau and won't see another spike until a run up on earnings (call should be mid November) or another upgrade from a major firm analyst. If you are a long term call holder (say Jan on out) and are fine with riding the waves then it is a hold until earnings but exit before IV crush.|2020-10-16 09:14:41

91x235|jc7ao5|jc7ao5|1|Trade 1: Nio was raised target by multiple banks. This causes the stock to rise from 21 to 23 in the morning. A times 7 scalp play on a weekly option buh by purchasing a 23c was super safe. I would have made 31k times 7.  Trade 2: On friday, multiple companies were golden. HERTZ ANNOUNCED new financing. I would have used Nio profits and alled in to retrieve a 2.5 times play. Another play I would have done is buy a weekly CCL 14c Call. If done the hertz correctly, I would have made 434,000.  I'm a fcking pussy. I saw both these trades unfold|2020-10-16 18:21:19
