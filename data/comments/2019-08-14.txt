wvn4ss|cq858a|cq858a|29|Everybody says negative yield curve is bad but no one explains why the fuck that is.  Banks borrow money from the Fed, central banks around the world and other entities in short term market rates and lend it to people and companies in long-term market rates. Also, the interest rates of depositors is determined by short term bond yields while interest rates of borrowers is determined by long term yields.  Basically the bank borrows money for 1% and lends it to you for 4% and makes money on the 3 percent difference. When the yield curve is zero or negative, banks can't make money by lending money, so they stop lending money. This means less money in the system and credit crunch. If people and businesses can't borrow, the economy can't grow.  If you can't get loans you can't buy cars, houses, mail order brides, roll your debt over...etc. That's how it causes recession.|2019-08-14 14:09:50

wvo51n|cq858a|cq858a|10|**Thought experiment:** if you were a fund manager investing other people's money, would you be buying the dip today, or would you prefer to see how China and Europe reacts to the second worst trading day for SPX this year (also just 9 days after the worst)?   Also for those who don't get what the fuck is happening - **if Europe gets a recession, you ain't getting away without a recession too**   and the headline today is saying that largest economy in Europe is on the edge, or might already be in a recession. Stimulus packages are now openly demanded from the government by the industry - and it's all over the papers. Any recent mention of Merkel is in the context of the recession - google her name.   Then we have the US market, that couldn't handle 2.5% interest rates. The only reason why we saw SPY300 is the top 10 anime twist of JPow the secret Dove. JPow - the guy who in December was preaching 'auto-pilot' selling and fucking hiked interest rates when business confidence was collapsing together with the SPX level. Bizzare events happened back then - like  banks randomly announcing they have sufficient liquidity - it was as if your partner came home and said "by the way, in case you were wondering, i did not cheat on you".   Anyway, back to EU's largest economy.  **The EU is China's largest trading partner** \- guess what the fuck happens to the Chinese economy, weakened by the tariffs, when they lose their largest fucking trade partner? Europe has massive business with China - what does Chinese economy do when this dries up?   Guess who is the largest trading partner for the US.|2019-08-14 14:20:18

wuquxj|cq858a|cq858a|6|In my opinion overreaction by the markets. I think yields are too low for inversion to matter. Secondly historically a one time inversion did not result in recession right away. 2 and 10 year yields inverted between 2005 and 2006 for a full 18 months. Before that yields inverted for the entire year of 2000. Before that from 78-80 before yields normalized. Each time yields normalized, recession occured. However, the sample size is small.   Yields inverted between late 80-82, and resulting 2 years? The market did not tank. Again at 89-90. Both times market did not tank. What's common between the two? yield inversion occurred when yields were at a steady decline. The difference? Market tanked when yield inversion occurred when yields were trending up. Both times markets lagged for a year before making a leg up.  We're seeing potential yield inversions as yields are declining. So I honestly stand by it, yields are too low for this to still matter.|2019-08-14 08:30:21
wuqxys|cq858a|cq858a|6|Why is everyone acting like the yields are the *only* reason we dropped? The yields are also inverting for a reason lol|2019-08-14 08:31:23

wvet64|cq858a|cq858a|9|From CNBC:  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said the markets may be wrong this time in trusting the yield curve inversion as a recession indicator.  "Historically, it has been a pretty good signal of recession, and it think that's when markets pay attention to it, but I would really urge that on this occasion it may be a less good signal," Yellen said on¬†[Fox Business Network] "The reason for that is there are a number of factors other than market expectations about the future path of interest rates that are pushing down long-term yields."  thIs TiMe iS DiFfeREnT  üòÇüòÇ|2019-08-14 12:46:20

Days of relentless selling, no bounces to trade, just straight fucking line and laughable attempts at bounces, making those $2000 jan-19 calls I bought back in July look like a less and less of a good idea. True to my name, I held, $110k RIP. (also $50k rip on jan-19 $170 calls).   Maybe it'll be just a bad memory in a week, maybe it'll continue squeezing all hope for the rest of the year. SPX still up 16% a year. If you were a fund manager long the market, would you hold this long now or just take 16% win this yr?  I dunno and I'm not playing.

wullzx|cq858a|cq858a|2|The problem is that both yields and rates are self-fulfilling prophecies.  Markets predict that rates will go up or down in the same way that they predict that yields will go up or down.  Right now, markets are pricing in a need to return to 0-0.25% rates because expectations are that US growth will approach zero over the next 2 years (due to overseas growth problems and the trade war).  That's why yields are collapsing and why you have a 2Y-10Y inversion... it's all connected based on expectations.|2019-08-14 07:21:12

It‚Äôs all just the same thing over and over; we can‚Äôt help ourselves. And you and I can‚Äôt control it, or stop it, or even slow it. Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong.  And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. Happy foxes and sad sacks. Fat cats and starving dogs in this world.

Given that money is flowing to USD and gold at the same time it seems that just owning the shares could be a good idea  edit: it is shutting down in a month,... not sure what that means for its price in these last days it is available but it has been mooning.

wv28u8|cq858a|cq858a|-3|Important question: why does it seem like a contract‚Äôs expiration isn‚Äôt priced in?   If my very speculative contract expires Friday afternoon and a 15% raise is needed to execute on the contract, it is reasonable to say that price won‚Äôt be hit. With that being said, good news on the stock will drive up the contract price +100%?   Wouldn‚Äôt a speculative contract‚Äôs value slowly lower each day as it approaches expiration, no matter the news on it?|2019-08-14 10:37:22

wv147p|cq858a|cq858a|-1|Silly question perhaps, but with options not traded after hours but lately major swings happening in post/pre market, what happens with option orders put in after hours? Is it possible that if for instance you put in put orders last night around the same time someone put in call orders, and they don't cancel their orders before market opens, their call orders go through and bust their shit while your put orders go through and you instalambo?|2019-08-14 10:25:19
