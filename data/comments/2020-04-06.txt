My take - it may or may not have hit the apex but that's only because of social distancing. The moment they pull those restrictions it'll be all hell break loose.|2020-04-06 11:29:42

"Yeah that's bad, but in one month we're just back to normal" So right now, bad news gets ignored for that exact reason. It's not that the market inverses the news. Market just doesn't give a fuck and trades independently from the news. The average investor doesn't know shit about how corporations work. They don't understand what 3 months of lost revenue means.   When the Corona variable goes away, and the average person realizes they're not immediately being called by their boss to be rehired that's what shit is gonna hit the fan. That's when even the Wall Street bulls realize this wasn't due to Corona.|2020-04-06 12:57:53

mlrat7|fvwu06|fvwu06|16|Disclaimer: am a bear, so feel free to ignore me  I do think there will be a next leg down and it will come from actually pricing in the economic severity of coronavirus, not from covid itself. Lets say that the curve actually is flattening, thats great! But it doesn't immediately change the massive problems caused by the past month and *through the end of April.* JPM forecasting a deep recession, IMF forecasting recession etc. (not to mention that Italy is again in a credit problem and the EU probably doesn't care, again). I think the rug pull happens soon now that the 'post-covid' fomo buying is happening because we reached the apex.

Instead, it will just be a slow bleed down to the core as the real economy, GDP and consumers start to be affected while Jpow and Trump jerk off behind their overheated printers.   Don't give me "uh muh Italy", shut the fuck up, it hasn't increased in 2 weeks and has been around the same daily deaths per day.

mlopa3|fvwu06|fvwu06|23|I don't think the downtrend was ever because of the impending deaths of 250K Americans. It was always because of the slowdown on the economy from nobody leaving their houses to go on trips, go shopping, go out to eat, etc.  What has changed today? All signs indicate that we still need another 60d of shutdown at least, which I don't think that most small businesses can survive. Who is taking trips after this? Will people feel comfortable sitting in a crowded restaurant at any point in the next 18 months? Will they feel comfortable trying on a shirt at the mall that someone else might have already worn, possibly with COVID? Will the average person be comfortable sitting on a plane that's basically just a flying can of sardines?  I don't think so.   Maybe only 100K Americans will die instead of 250K.

Stocks will continue to rise.  The only big ‚Äúnews‚Äù that could shock the stock market in the coming weeks is unemployment numbers, which we all know no one gives a f about.

These two will NOT let this market fail. JPOW buying assets and offering free loans, Trump assuring the big boys that this will all pass by Easter (more likely EOM April, but it doesnt matter).

Servicers are granting the payment deferrals to borrowers with no questions asked, as is required by the law, but the servicers still have to pay mortgage bond holders. Now that rate is skyrocketing, and servicers do not have nearly enough cash to cover those payments to bondholders.  SPY: iLl fuCkInG dO iT AgAin|2020-04-06 10:34:54

Meaning by the time we reopen, that's how much damage has been done.Now, what do you think is more likely,  We drop 30% tomorrow and trade flat for the next 2 months  Or  Whenever price goes down the bulls resist, try to pump it back up. Price fluctuates like a motherfucker, but the longer this drags on, the more the bulls realize the economy is fucked and stop buying the dip. Eventually in 2-3 months you end at your spy 180 target.  The reason we dropped as much as we did is because **everyone** agreed we are fucked. Right now, plenty of people believe this isn't a real crisis. They think as soon as we open the economy, we're back to ATH within a month. Over time, more and more will realize this is bad. And you become a Bull the very moment everyone becomes a bear.

mlgtjb|fvwu06|fvwu06|7|Michael J Burry has an American patriotism. He knows that market will crash extremely bad but just to promote a sense of false hope, he is "acting" bullish in twitter. This guy kept a low profile all his life and decided to raise his bullish voice in this market? I think he just wants to see US unchanged but we are now in a different reality.  >15 million mortgage defaults? An unemployment rate exceeding 10%? Social unrest can be expected as it passes 20%. Unthinkable in America. Just two months ago the economy was great. A virus shows up that kills less than 0.2%, and the government does THIS?  &#x200B;  >History‚Äôs best-ever bull market was built on sub-5% annual revenue growth, \~200bps of margin improvement and $4 trillion in stock buybacks funded by $4 trillion in new debt. Now that buybacks make sense, companies are limited by their debt. Classic.  Michael J Burry is mad.

mncy8p|fvwu06|fvwu06|3|Two points: 1. Your puts are probably fucked if they expire within the next month or so.  2. This is a bear market rally within GFC #2. The rally could last months for all I know but the underlying problems here are the exact same problems that caused the first financial crisis a decade ago. The market fell persistently throughout the first three weeks of March in 2008, completely disregarding the extreme emergency actions of the federal reserve. Then, after bear sterns failed suddenly everything seemed OK and people decided to credit the Fed and all of their ‚Äústimulus‚Äù for saving the system. Markets rallied through the middle of the summer and people were talking about raising the Fed funds rate soon and a strong labor market around the corner. But the problems weren‚Äôt gone and the Feds stimulus hadn‚Äôt changed anything. The market would fall another 45%.   The exact same problems exist today and it‚Äôs not  a coincidence that this is happening in March again. There a quirks in the dollar funding system then tend to create bottlenecks at certain times of year, namely March and September. This has been shown repeatedly since 08. The dollar funding problems today are perhaps the most severe that have ever existed, worse than 08. We‚Äôve gotten a reprieve here but they‚Äôll return.  Have fun thinking QE infinity and the Fed buying stonks is going to change any of this.|2020-04-06 20:34:10

The premiums on SPY are also getting to be very, very high, even as VIX trends downward. My only concern is that the volumes on the IWM contracts are much lower than compared to SPY.

mm27kx|fvwu06|fvwu06|5| An estimated additional 180 - 195 deaths per day occurring at home in New York City due to COVID-19 are not being counted in the official figures. "Early on in this crisis we were able to swab people who died at home, and thus got a coronavirus reading. But those days are long gone. We simply don't have the testing capacity for the large numbers dying at home. Now only those few who had a test confirmation \*before\* dying are marked as victims of coronavirus on their death certificate. This almost certainly means we are undercounting the total number of victims of this pandemic," said Mark Levine, Chair of New York City Council health committee  but otherwise the numbers look like the curve IS being flattened  &#x200B;   [https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1247155576221716480](https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1247155576221716480)|2020-04-06 13:23:38

In other words, if we keep the economy shut down, right where it is, it seems that the pandemic won't get worse.  That is not at all the same as saying things are getting better. We have no evidence the virus is going away, or that we're becoming immune. Which means that sending people back to work again - restarting the economy - may simply re-fuel the pandemic. Optimism will be justified when the President announces a detailed plan for how we will uniformly test for the virus, trace and quarantine all carriers, and execute a contain and control plan that allows local work to restart, with a statewide and then regional rollout.    But based on the last 4 months of shoot-from the lip incompetence, don't expect any such planning from this Administration.|2020-04-06 12:41:07

mlzc3m|fvwu06|fvwu06|2|From an article online .. Now get the reasons for pump ..  ‚ÄúMy mother who is 75 years old tells me two weeks ago that she put $30K into the market. I asked her why she would do that without talking to me and she said, "the market dropped and I think it's a good time to buy."  If you're 70, now is not the time to buy any stocks. You need to wait for true capitulation and we only saw the first wave of it. These things take time, patience, and discipline. You will get your chance but not at 2,500 on the S&P.‚Äù|2020-04-06 12:58:45

Companies reporting low earnings won't suggest that the entire viability of that company is broken, it just means that they were impacted by the same thing every other company is impacted by.   I'm not going to panic sell all my shares at this point because of a low earnings report, because it's entirely expected. The jobs will still be there, the earnings will still be there, it's just a waiting game at this point.

Depending on your position, you may think stonk is overvalued or undervalued, you buy puts or calls, whatever.  Even when earnings come out, or 10k or whatever financial shit comes out, if the investors BELIEVE a stock should be valued at $x, does that always win?  For instance, lets say boeing loses all contracts, whatever, paint as grim of a picture as you want, as long as people are investing in the stock at $150, will it always remain there or is there some event that forces the value of the stock to eventually fall back to some EPS/valuation formula?|2020-04-06 14:48:27

ml0fh4|fvwu06|fvwu06|-7|I don‚Äôt get why everyone is insanely bearish right now. They just keep quoting unemployment rates being unprecedented. Yes, we get it. These are also unprecedented times while in quarantine.  Most of those unemployed are small businesses, specifically restaurants and retails for example. In my line of work we are talking to them on a regular basis. There‚Äôs a reason they let them go because they want them to collect unemployment while they couldn‚Äôt get paid since the business would lose between 80-100% of their cash flow. On the flip side, we aren‚Äôt seeing the people let go apply for different jobs, as they are expecting this to blow over by May and they go back to their normal jobs.  Additionally, some companies are giving paid 2 weeks absence while they get direction from the government. They don‚Äôt want to lose their workforce.  While many of you want to make some quick bucks on your 4/17 puts, remember that these are real people trying to keep their jobs and livelihood and the government isn‚Äôt going to let this all come crashing down overnight.

mm797h|fvwu06|fvwu06|-12|Who  follows Q? The Cabal and Deep State are falling for good. This is not just a  virus. My question is how do you guys think this will impact the market  when the truth comes out this week?  Have about 6k in SPY 180-220 puts 4/17-5/15 but not sure how this news  coming out will affect market. I think a massive dip due to mass panic  and confusion then rally due to the reality of Light and Truth winning above Evil but hard to tell the time lines.... maybe massive crash com 4/17 and rallies after May to ATH's.  &#x200B;  There are FAR deeper things  going on and at this point it's beyond a shadow of a doubt. It will come  out Friday when market is closed.  TL;DR: buy puts/calls?   Imagine being a serious trader and NOT following Q/Cabal/Deep State truth.|2020-04-06 14:08:02
