And how much revenue did they do? 550m. And their expenses went through the fucking roof leaving them with a 200m loss. Their direct listing value? 40bn. How the fuck are they going to grow their company? Everybody already knows about roblox and pretty much their entire target market already plays it. They would need a fucking miracle to justify that valuation.   #Don't buy|2021-03-09 07:38:56

Greed.  Miss the top, influenced by cult thinking $1k is a sure bet.  Miss the second peak in $300s. Still brain dead.  Panic sell on the way back down at $72. Make like $10k in profits. Yeehaw.  Take $10k in gains, invest it in AAPL $140+ monthly calls and PLTR $35 monthly calls at the start of the dip. Take initial $6k and dump into APHA near the top.  Come March.

qbmpae|m144ua|m144ua|100|Looking at the media, they have decided to seem like they are long on GME and are using Cohen's appointment as the catalyst behind the rise. All that is done to hide, cover and hush hush the new SEC ruling about clearing. That is where the beast lays:  Everybody who is serious about the stock knows that there are more shares being traded daily than the actual shares, about 4 times as much, yes, that much. This is a huge problem, it is so big that no media outlet dares to touch that actual story. The 21-day rollover rule has created imaginary shares that have been 'failed to deliver' by shorts for months, maybe more.   Options being written on shares that writers are told they own but in reality do not because they haven't been delivered by shorts to the clearing house is a fat big problem that threatens the whole financial system. This is much bigger than we think. What happens then is that brokers get caught in the middle. When the clearing house can not provide the actual stocks to brokers who have paid for them and told their customers they own the stock, we have serious fraud on the table.  There is going to be a responsible party for those imaginary shares. It will certainly not be retail holders, brokers will start buying the shorts into the stock to save themselves from being the responsible party. The SEC and the clearing house is no way going to be left holding the bag, that is too much responsibility and it would collapse the entire market.  Thus, the 2-day ruling. It is an incredibly important piece of news that everybody is trying to hide from the people and attention.  What is happening here is historic. As the price of GME goes up, the magnitude of the problem gets massive as the amount of money that cannot be accounted for gets huge.  I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. $1000 is not a meme, $2000 is around the corner, $5000 is no joke at all. Hold. You are witnessing one of the greatest stories of capitalism. This is getting serious.|2021-03-09 07:01:21

The memes and talk were really funny but I really didn't understand wth was going on here.  I stayed for awhile for the memes, but left before Covid. I came back in mid January because I realized investing for retirement is not at all interesting.  Its fucking boring.  Watching your account grow is almost as much fun as watching corn grow. With GME in the news I started actually reading the posts. I've learned more in 8 weeks watching and reading a bunch of autist apes with smooth brains and simian creased hands than I did in nearly two years of reading about 'investing.'

I could be 5% off in either direction but go ahead and take this to the bank.    disclosure for karens: I don't know shit about setting price targets and nothing I say should be listened to.|2021-03-09 05:48:16

I got this flair for betting against Musk at a time no one else would, and I plan to make my first million doing the same. 🤡 * These fucking bears don't even realize how fast recovery can be for tech. The dot com bubble recovered after a mere 8 years. 🤡 * Kathy waiting to reveal she’s gone heavily into $rope. 🤡 * If this is the best Tesla can do with wood on tv pumping it then I’m holding my puts lol. 🤡 * I think we’ll start moderately green tomorrow. Nasdaq, DOW, all that. DOW ends up bigly and Nasdaq fades all day and continues to dump this week and until every person who paid $600+ for Tesla is left staring at pictures of a cyber truck wondering how many decepticons they know who would fucking love it.

I buy out of favor stocks and carry them to safety then sell them to pussy hedge fund managers who don’t want to get their hands dirty. When I sold 700k in Nordstrom contracts one buyer alone bought like 500k of them in a single transaction. Now I’m doing the same thing, getting my hands dirty in Brazil until hedge funds managers deem it safe to invest there again.

qdgp43|m144ua|m144ua|11|The best MMORPG is the stock market.  NASDAQ, SPY, DOW, NYSE are some of the world servers.   You can fight bears/bulls/kangaroos/apes when you enter the different battle zones. These battlezones include webull, robinhood, fidelity, etc.  Additionally , you can equip rare items such as paper, diamonds, rockets, etc on your characters.  To level up, you just need to win your fights in the battle zones and increase your wealth. You may die at times, and you may respawn at 0 to fight again and work your way to the top.   The GM (game masters) include DFV, WSB Mod and NPCs are r/investing, r/stocks who try to give financial advice.|2021-03-09 15:09:25

qcy2wk|m144ua|m144ua|2|So I went on TradingView app to look at charts for AMC because I was thinking of selling some. I had never seen it on mobile before, but when I scrolled down to look for a chart, I saw something that said "Biggest Gainers/Losers." When I looked at the biggest losers, something caught my eye.  GRAY was down 50% from yesterday. Looked at their charts, and 2 days in a row it practically had vertical drops. Fell from $35 in feb all the way to $7.25 now.   I have no idea what this company is, or what they do. But knowing what I know about how bananas work (drop them and they bounce), I bought 100 shares.   This is the most retarded thing I have done to date (aside from buying $350 GME).|2021-03-09 12:50:39

qd1fhh|m144ua|m144ua|3|The funny thing about bears is that they always say "greedy bulls will get punished" but by the time that the correction comes, most bulls are already up 100's of % and even if they panic sell they are most likely still profitable if they've been trading for more than 3 weeks  Then the bears buy puts, get themselves a nice 100% return only to be just as greedy as the bulls and lose it all in a matter of days.  The difference is bears get those chances to buy puts and actually make money maybe twice a year.      Bulls rally literally 90% of the time. Being a bear in my eyes is just hating money The stock market is easy when you think about it. Stocks (almost always) go up. Why the fuck would you bet against that?|2021-03-09 13:16:01

qct7rd|m144ua|m144ua|2|I know everyone hates this bear talk, but I really think this could be game over. $100 day for TSLA? GME mooning again? 4% day for DAQ and counting..This could be the blow-off top before March 2.0 begins and I mean a real sell-off not that joke we had last week. This is the bulltrap to end all bulltraps. Right around 390 at an I don't even know how many times TOP. We close high today but tomorrow might be the catalyst. Yields slightly down but could be zooming back up tomorrow after the treasury auction. I could see this coinciding with the selloff. Stimulus didn't do shit to pump Monday, don't forget that ended red for both Nasdaq and S&P 500, yet now it decides to pump all of a sudden? Yeah you can't call a top exactly, but I just get a feeling we're right around the corner from heavy selling|2021-03-09 12:11:41

qd0fr1|m144ua|m144ua|2|I read today that about a 1/3 of all securities are on loan to short sellers. Of course this is going to create massive instability in the stock markets! The stock market is already wild enough without this opaque short selling situation. The only solution is more transparency in the long run, and I hope that the hedge funds that created this situation pay for it.  I used to think hedge funds actually discovered a viable approach to reduce their risk exposure, however it's clear now that it has a huge downside as it creates this crazy currents that can be exploited with a squeeze. The big players can all team up and mitigate the risk, but all it takes is a bunch of crazy apes to fuck up their plans.

I had the entire cost of the stocks covered with cash already but then this fee put me in the deficit. I’m going back in forth with them via email and they just keep feeding me bullshit.

Respectively, they are wrong on their updated PT. The valuation concern is unwarranted for $ROKU imo and I disagree with their rationale around a rising rate environment severely limiting the stock. Rates might rise, but we are still historically low. Real rates will keep funds flowing into equities. Roku's only true barrier at this point is global expansion. Otherwise, the story hasn't changed and the stock has already corrected what? Like 35%. It is much more reasonable here, but even at 400+ it is not at all overvalued when you look at the value of a streaming platform/OS...there is risk obviously, but damn, I love $ROKU here.|2021-03-09 10:00:05

qbshe3|m144ua|m144ua|-10|DFV is like Rosa Parks.  Hear me out, the hedge funds wanted DFV and GME to sit in the back of the bus with a bumpy ride. But DFV stood up and said, GME has Ryan Cohen, e-commerce, booming gaming industry, and it's a DEEP FUCKING VALUE. So like Rosa parks he walked GME straight to the front of the bus where every stock moons.  GME was loving the front but the idiot hedgies got mad and said GET TO THE BACK, and tried to force us back with short sells. Retards didn't like this. The word spread to wsb retards and we were pissed, all the retards and DFV said we like the stock and bought, and didn't sell. We weren't riding the bus, we weren't playing the game. By not riding we hurt them significantly and force change!There's a new rule around failure to delivers because of us and DFV! Brokers were caught manipulating the time they need to deliver shares by selling and rebuying. Now retards here can sit anywhere on the short bus  DFV rallied us around Gamestop just like Rosa parks rallied people against the bus operators. We both caused financial pain to create change.

The Q4 earnings report typically does an inflation on the underlying value of the bottom.

Poor people making political / ideological stands like every other sub on Reddit. Mods you’ve enabled this stupid behavior.   Good luck in the times to come, rich will get richer and regulations and taxes will hurt the wealth growth for the 99.5%.  But hey you found a crusade.|2021-03-09 21:11:10

qbr1ha|m144ua|m144ua|-7|Edit: this comminity is TRASH, obviously I'm mostly out of robinhood I'm just not letting them have free money why would i do that?  What is the robinhood support email? I can't get in contact with anybody. I had to have the bank dispute my robinhood deposit because on feb 28th i initiated a deposit. They instantly took the money from my bank account. This was the same day they started limiting GME and other stocks so i cancelled my deposit. They never credited the money to my robinhood account but they never sent it back to my bank. So the reversal finally went through, but my robinhood account claims a "deficit" as if i withdrew the money, but that money was just the reversal they were supposed to process weeks ago at this point! I'm not standing for this deficit and all their auto responses and FAQ are useless! Fuck robinhood! But i need the support email|2021-03-09 07:43:32
