To his surprise she actually says yes. He is overcome with joy and immidiately starts to prepare. First he goes to get a tux. All the other senior boys are there getting thiers as well so the line is out the door. Then he goes to get a corsage. Again, everyone is there to buy one so the line is incredibly long. He goes to rent a limo and yet again, the line is packed full. He begins to wonder if it is all worth it. Even going to the barber for a fresh hair cut has a longer wait than usual. The day of prom finally comes and he arrives with his date to get thier picture taken. Once more he waits in line. Once that is done she tells him she is thirsty, he goes to get her some punch and there is no punchline.|2022-09-15 14:13:34okhdxo|xesr78|xesr78|3|Omg Bers broke 390.

Drop panel ceiling tiles hid a million screaming voices overhead as humidity and sweat soaked our off-the-rack suits from Men's Wearhouse. We cut our way through the cubicles in hopes that it was not too late; That the receptionist we’d spoken to earlier was telling the truth. Unfortunately for us, he was.    We heard the thing before we saw it. The entire office went quiet, leaving only the ominous sound of something enormous dragging across cheap carpet.  My men and I had seen the worst of it during the bear market of 2008. We were chosen for this contract because of our fearless constitution. But the funny thing about fear is it never really goes away. It just waits, and then punishes you for all the time you spent ignoring it. We were told exactly what to expect, but I still remember the screaming when we saw it with our own eyes.    What slithered into the break room before us had once been known as a bul, but no longer. The man had let his balls become so large that they absorbed him, growing ever bigger in the process and gaining access to all of JPow’s thoughts and memories. Pentagon intel suggested that this giant sentient ballsack understood the need for sustenance, and therefore had become the apex predator of the cubicle farm. It was a truly impressive pair of balls, and we were given the impossible task of taking it down.    Our tranq rounds bounced off its hairy, wrinkled skin as it roared from some unseen mouth. Chad was the first to fire his pistol, and for that received the bulk of a thirty foot conference table to the torso, popping his limbs off like a ken doll. And then it was chaos. That man’s balls picked us off one by one, screaming its territorial warning. All of the fear and dread that I’d repressed over twenty years flooded back into my nervous system, freezing me. I saw into the eye of god himself as those balls towered over me. It used one stray pube to stroke my cheek, no longer perceiving me as a threat. Then it rolled off into the executive offices, squishing between cubicles at a hundred clicks an hour.    I collected my men's ID badges and trudged back alone. The next day, I made some pizza pops and shit my pants.|2022-09-15 07:03:12oistaq|xesr78|xesr78|6|Tesla bulls bout to cope so hard since it double topped yesterday|2022-09-15 07:25:29oitng4|xesr78|xesr78|6|Claims down, bulls fucked|2022-09-15 07:32:40oivkvx|xesr78|xesr78|5|Wow, that data is fucking terrible ![img](emotet5_2th524271)|2022-09-15 07:48:20oiwgro|xesr78|xesr78|6|Spy calls until next Wednesday|2022-09-15 07:55:22oj1mff|xesr78|xesr78|5|GameStop|2022-09-15 08:34:18oj365d|xesr78|xesr78|6|Do I see it right??

Quick guide to save portfolio of dying bulls.  1. Buy some long dated (December safe, October less safe, etc.) puts. This will prevent your options from losing 80% of their value during the wild market swings we are experiencing. 2. Is there a pump? Add a little more to your position. If you got a good entry, this should be easy. **Best entries was weeks ago though, while you were being a regarded bull, so this will be RISKY.** 3. Ride the wave down. 4. Scale out at SPY \~370. This exciting brand new concept is called "taking profit", do not be afraid of it. 5. Use a stop loss, no... don't put it .1c below your entry. 6. Did Jerome say we're gucci? No? Look for another bounce and add some more if macro hasn't changed. 7. Exit at \~350 or below and stay cash until Jerome says we're gucci.

The theory is that rising dollar will force all other countries to rapidly print more of their own currency to pay down dollar denominated debt thus fueling demand for US dollar even more. Countries will be forced to rapidly devalue their own currencies which is already happening and the capital will start flowing back into USA since its the only safe haven.   This can create an unstoppable force that will crash the world economy with the sovereign debt crisis.   https://youtu.be/xxzy3sLs4Bs|2022-09-15 13:36:05okc703|xesr78|xesr78|2|I have Zillow filters and notifications setup for a year now.

Right now I am really thinking short term. Due to inflation I am currently spending more money than I earn. I am a working student and my salary has always been barely enough. Luckily, I am finishing my degree soon and my current company will take me over so I am in for a HUGE raise in about 5 months.  A few years ago I invested about 3 grand and have lost about 800€ since then, mainly due to some bad moves during COVID and the Ukraine crisis. My number one priority right now is to keep my losses at a minimum and try to reduce them. I will be selling some stocks regularly to support my life over the next few months.  What are y'all suggesting I should do given the rather volatile market right now?  TL;DR I am trying to cut my losses over the next few months and will need to sell some of my stock. What can I do right now that is low risk and may allow me to make some short term gains?|2022-09-15 12:16:12ojzzoz|xesr78|xesr78|0|This moonege makes no sense ![img](emotet5_2th528883)|2022-09-15 12:19:57ok14bg|xesr78|xesr78|0|Spy 💦💦💦|2022-09-15 12:27:12ok17c6|xesr78|xesr78|0|my lips, to citadels ears|2022-09-15 12:27:45ok17xb|xesr78|xesr78|0|i see alot of bulls salty about their losses over this last week XD|2022-09-15 12:27:51ok1nj6|xesr78|xesr78|0|LOL wall st, makes me laugh sometimes.
