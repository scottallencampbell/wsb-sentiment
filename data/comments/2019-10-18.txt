466akx|djlwg3|djlwg3|8|I'm sure some of you already know this, but maybe it'll help out a fellow autist--so I finally clawed my way up to 25k, finally freed from the shackles of PDT restrictions. I thought that, once this happened, I'd be able to day trade with complete impunity and that the previous PDT mark I received would just fall off in 90 days from the original date. I was wrong.  Apparently, even if you have 25k, you will still get *re-marked* as a PDT any time you exceed the normal 5-day 3-trade rule. The only thing having 25k does is prevent you from being completely banned from closing positions for 90 days if you happen to day trade *while* PDT-restricted.  The more you know.

46c1yb|djlwg3|djlwg3|5|in the September FOMC meeting minutes we can see that the Fed was worried that the market was pricing in too many cuts. They were like... yeah we may not do another cut for a while after this one.     What we've been hearing from them more recently seems different. We've got the continuation of Repo relief for what seems to be indefinitely. We've got expansion of the balance sheet but it's "not QE". They're threatening to cut rates again but it's "not a continuation of a longer cut cycle".     Just keep inflating the stock market bubble while you blow smoke up our asses.|2019-10-18 08:53:54

47i7zl|djlwg3|djlwg3|5|Guess who bought a NFLX call spread and a put spread before earnings, this guy 😎  Guess who sold the put spread yesterday for a loss, but held on to the call spread because they thought it was going to increase in value since it was expiring soon and NFLX was way above the strike prices, but then it crashed today so they had to sell for a loss and ended up losing money overall. Also this guy.  Anyway, my main question is if anyone could point me to any resources on dealing with intellectual disabilities. That'd be nice.

47xx7u|djlwg3|djlwg3|2|Feeling good about Monday. Another lesson today and this week to take profits. Was up 500 this week but let my puts ride out to red today. Made a smart choice to roll them out and got calls to hedge. The fast drop scared me and I sold my calls and before I could close my puts we were already climbing back up. At 298.7 I revenge traded some 10/23 puts that I was able to dump last minute. So overall down 100 for the week.   At least in losing exponentially less money now that I open much smaller trades. I do miss swinging 4 figures every day though :(|2019-10-18 15:12:38

46ey5q|djlwg3|djlwg3|1|Slate.com: Andrew Yang is Full of It  tech bros and SV turning on Yang? If Slate is printing this narrative, thats not a good look for Yang especially after his disastrous Maddow interview.    Yang's done, so that leaves Warren and Biden. Warren probably is good for the markets in the long run because she'll put in much needed regulation and Biden will just run full "fuck you, print money" for big money guys and maybe expanding Obamacare.  Gonna probably hold my stock and calls through 2020, I don't think the recession indicators really panned out. We have a lot of good numbers countering the earlier bad numbers, so we might just be in a temporary downside that recently turned back up.  Also China still being able to pull 6% growth as they move from manufacturing to services is a respectable number. I don't think the global recession is here anytime soon, maybe 3-5 years more of a bull run.|2019-10-18 09:11:40

47cxeu|djlwg3|djlwg3|1|Hey question. So I am familiar with spreads to lock in profits. I've been noticing that when I swing trade and do spreads I don't lose out on any money with the difference between the strikes no matter where it moves.  So would it makes sense to say say sell a call to lock in profits and then immediately buy and sell a put spread so that way if it dips the shrinking difference between my call spreads will now be offset by the increasing difference of my put spreads between the strikes?|2019-10-18 12:44:12
