i6qhi3|f6riyt|f6riyt|21|ETFC just got bought by Morgan Stanley for $13B. They're up 23% premarket.   PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!  I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here.   When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased.   I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times.   The only play in this deal, if you wanted one, is to play Morgan Stanley.|2020-02-20 07:17:52

i7vdht|f6riyt|f6riyt|6|I want to note that, as some in the thread have suggested, that there is a potential bear flag setup currently ongoing. If it completes, the drop will be to around 333.2. Tomorrow will be the first bit of economic news all of this week (Flash PMI), and if expectations missed, would be a good fundamentally driven excuse for completion of that pattern.  I will also note that, by bear flag definitions, it does not completely fit the pattern criteria. The sell-off earlier today had very little volume during the initial drop, suggesting coordinated/institutional off-loading. However, the other trait-- price increase but with decreasing buying volume-- is occurring right now.|2020-02-20 14:00:56

i76ep9|f6riyt|f6riyt|3|Abandon ship!   Morgan Stanley Space Team Predicts Correction in Virgin Galactic Stock. 'Even Spaceships Must Return to Earth.' -- Barrons.com  2/20/20, 5:05 PM One of Virgin Galactic's bulls sounded a note of caution Thursday. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas warned investors that the stock might dip as he previewed the space start-up's coming earnings report.  Virgin Galactic (ticker: SPCE) reports numbers for the fourth quarter and full year on Tuesday, after the market closes.  "Even spaceships must return to Earth," wrote Jonas in a Thursday report. "Enthusiasm around the emerging space economy has triggered a pace and volume and volatility around [Virgin Galactic stock] that has taken the MS Space Team by surprise. A modest correction is overdue, and frankly healthy."  Jonas left his price target for the stock unchanged at $22, about 40% below recent levels, and maintained his Overweight rating on the shares. (Overweight is the Morgan Stanley equivalent of a Buy rating.)  Jonas says the earnings release and conference call will focus on the company's progress certifying the VSS Unity spaceship with aviation regulators. Backlog -- the number of people waiting to fly into space -- will also be an important topic for investors.  Investors don't seem to care about the caution. Shares are up another 3.6% in Thursday morning trading. Virgin Galactic stock is up about 240% year to date, crushing comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Shares are up more than 450% from their 52-week low.  It isn't all about space tourism for the company. Virgin Galactic also has plans to build hypersonic vehicles that will travel at more than 3,000 miles per hour, many times the speed of sound.  That technology won't generate sales for years, but the potential is easy to see. Everyone would like to fly across the U.S. in less than an hour.  Jonas includes the hypersonic opportunity in his valuation of the company and says shares are trading at about eight times his estimated 2030 sales. His most bullish scenario for the stock price is $60. That assumes everything, including space tourism and hypersonic flight, develops faster than investors expect.  --Write to Al Root at  allen.root@dowjones.com|2020-02-20 10:14:01

i7r5ne|f6riyt|f6riyt|5|Heads up everybody. TSLA's German Gig Factory was halted this past weekend. They went to court on Tuesday and the news about the decision to resume clearing the forest is expected today or tomorrow. Here is a quote from an article posted earlier this afternoon.   "Now the Berlin court has to decide. "The judges have been providing intensive advice on the case since Tuesday," said OVG spokesman Ulrich Marenbach. “The decision could be made on Thursday evening, at the latest on Friday. So that if Tesla makes a positive decision, it can clear before the breeding period. "   Link to article, you have to translate it, but it is a few paragraphs down.  [https://m.bild.de/regional/berlin/berlin-regional-politik-und-wirtschaft/justiz-krimi-um-die-geplante-tesla-autofabrik-in-brandenburg-68914990,view=amp.bildMobile.html?\_\_twitter\_impression=true](https://m.bild.de/regional/berlin/berlin-regional-politik-und-wirtschaft/justiz-krimi-um-die-geplante-tesla-autofabrik-in-brandenburg-68914990,view=amp.bildMobile.html?__twitter_impression=true)   Load up on calls cause TSLA is cheap right now. It will surely pop after this news get released (if the court decision is good, which it should be).   Decision might come tonight or tomorrow during trading. But there is also a risk it won't come until the weekend. So 2/21 calls if you are feeling risky. Or 2/28 if you want to be a little safer.|2020-02-20 13:24:10

I verified this with 5+ profiles I watched over an hour. Lets get these fucking shills out of here before we get shut down and before they lead more people into pump and dumps...

i7w2ro|f6riyt|f6riyt|4|I just noticed both of the sudden volume spikes in SPCE from the past week (corresponding with the super run up on Tuesday and the super run up today) occurred at around the same time (10:30-10:45 AM). Both also form a very similar pattern on the chart when using 15 min candles, and are followed by a similar pattern (almost identical) afterwards. This both in terms of price action and volume.  This shit is being traded 100% on autopilot. I’m almost certain. Since 13th Feb, this chart has formed way too many similar patterns.|2020-02-20 14:07:04

i747rw|f6riyt|f6riyt|2|Options question: for long dated puts, this case December EEM deep OTM puts, I am not seeing small gains when EEM does go down...I assume this is from volatility going down? Theta burn shouldn't be an issue because its just one-day closer to a date that's like 330 days away. TL/DR EEM is down a .3% from when I bought puts this morning, but my puts haven't appreciated. Just curious if this is purely a volatility going down-issue, or what may be happening. I don't really read greeks, plz don't hate me.|2020-02-20 09:52:30

i7uewc|f6riyt|f6riyt|5|$ALLY is severely undervalued   Ally has beaten every quarter’s earnings with a quarterly earnings growth of 30.3%. It’s EPS has grown every quarter to indicate this change. However, with the buyout of CardWorks, $ALLY still maintains a current ratio of .88 and will only increase once its position has been consolidated. Market analysts estimate that a consensus price target is a low of $36 and a high of $45, an average PT of $39.17. Do your own DD but I’m confident in Ally.|2020-02-20 13:52:40

i6zm1a|f6riyt|f6riyt|2|Understanding calls and puts  I was wondering if someone could help explain calls and puts.   I have researched for a bit and understand the basics. What I don’t understand is figuring out how much a call would cost and how much it would pay.   For example:   Say Tesla is at 900 a share. I put a call for 1200 by October. How do I know how much it will cost me? How do I know how much I’ll make if it hits 1200?   What if I put the call in at 850 and it goes up to 1200?   I just can’t seem to grasp the price/roi and the idea of when and how much to bet.   Thanks|2020-02-20 09:05:24

i7b34q|f6riyt|f6riyt|1|Trump needs to contract Virgin for a fire side chat on one of their space craft with Xi about the future of the economy.  I did the calculations and I found that there would be three seats left for passengers.  One could be for a Chinese national press agent, another would be for American, and the last could be somebody from the internet or maybe  Musk or Brandson.  "Look Xi, Arabs pumping their obsolete energy source. Soon their region's relevancy will be in the dust bin of history."  After that flight the next chat could be the Starship which would have better facilities & more passenger seats. For instance we would have a mini bar & toilets.It's mother fucking space, world leaders would play the ass kissing game to go for a ride. Trump could invite a few Make A Wish kids, the closest we we got to children going to space was the teacher who died on the challenger.  That's what the markets & the economy needs right now.

i7ma56|f6riyt|f6riyt|1|Yo mods, can we have a temporary halt to gain and lost porn posts? I feel like it is bringing bad attention to this sub.   Cramer had a big hand in tanking TSLA last night and a part of that is cause he mentioned this sub and SPCE and saw WSBGOD's post.   When real investors see the gains on this subreddit, it confirms their sense that we are in a bubble and shit like this flash crash happens. I dont think we have a big effect on the rest of the market, but still I think it contributes to a sense that a correction is needed.|2020-02-20 12:40:30

i896eh|f6riyt|f6riyt|1|Total noob question but, this seems to be the place to be able to ask and have it answered.  If I buy a 3X S&P fund, and the market drops 35%, will my balance be negative?   Do I need to have a margin call amount in the account?   I understand from a high level that these mutual funds use leverage so I am wondering if it is the same as buying on margin.|2020-02-20 15:56:22
