rcwmof|gnu61u|gnu61u|18|5 months from now: SPY at 220. Prez, veep and pow together on White House Live. Last hurrah to save America as virus taken out half of the country and nearly  their whole administration. Each chug a double shot of hydroxychloroquine. Trump turns orange...r, falls to the ground, letting out a huge shart in his last moment. Pence grabs his chest and starts having a heart attack. Final words "...I ...love ...boys." SPY shatters 200. Pow stays standing, though. His eyes darken and he starts morphing. Horns sprouting out of his skull. Nose turning into a snout. He's turning into a fucking bull. But alive, the virus inside him eradicated. He charges through the back of the set. CRASH, BANG, BRRRR. Powbull comes back into the frame, vaporized breath coming out of his nostrils. He majestically puffs out his chest and raises his head, with a fucking printer speared on each horn. The virus is dead. America is saved. SPY doubles up to 400 in two minutes. TSLA finally breaks 1000, even though Elon has been dead for over a month now. Algos tweet on his account that prices are too high and sends the stock plummeting once again. WSB cucked as everyone is a gay bear at this point.  Tl:Dr SPY 400P 9/30|2020-05-21 11:48:49

Speaking to the press, Zheng also added that bills in the US that target Chinese companies are "baseless" and against international laws. He went on to note that China "never starts trouble" but also "never flinches when trouble comes its way." Zheng stressed that Beijing is prepared to defend its interests in case the US undermines them, but also pointed out that both countries stand to profit if they work together.  The United States has been introducing a range of measures against China and its companies as Washington blames the country for the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Beijing strongly denies US accusations.|2020-05-21 10:10:05

A phase 1/2 trial for the recombinant adenovirus vaccine -- also known as AZD1222 -- began last month to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in more than 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 across several trial centers in southern England.  Data is expected "shortly" which, if positive, would lead to late-stage trials in several countries, the company said. The development program that is being supported by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority includes a phase three clinical trial with 30,000 participants and a pediatric trial, according to a statement.  "AstraZeneca recognizes the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk," the company said in a statement.|2020-05-21 06:09:55

rc5c0a|gnu61u|gnu61u|2|It isn't too late to get in on UGA calls. UGA tracks actual gasoline and not diesel in the United States. I've seen social media posts everywhere about their first time filling up in a month, etc, and with everything open gas prices will slowly return to normal as consumer demand rises. Gas prices have risen each spring in to summer for the last 5 years.  We are still at least 40-50% away from "normal gas" prices at their lowest range. Additionally, one of the biggest inputs, crude, has seen a dramatic recovery in price.  Also, there should be up days today and tomorrow in anticipation of memorial day weekend.

I am in the tech field and splunk's logging is the MOST expensive solution available.    There are very few features that anchor customers and swapping out to another service OR even an open source solution can easily be changed out in a 2 week sprint by a dev team.  Companies trying to cut costs are looking at this product for easy savings.  Lastly for just the last month, they are up $35 and for the week $10.  If the earnings are worse than just okay, this thing is going to tank big time.  I have a put at 155 on 5/22|2020-05-21 09:52:14

rbyup9|gnu61u|gnu61u|4|There's a fucking reason why geckos and dogs can predict the future better than us - they aren't deciding whether it's up or down based on any knowledge. It's because they, like the markets, are on a RNG right now.  But anyway let's move on and talk about WAB. I'm a train loving autist so naturally I'm more drawn to rail stuff. Its stock prices aren't that high, about $78 pre-rona, but right now it's about $57 ish and I feel they could benefit from the States opening right up again. Definitely a longer play, but I don't believe they'll be doing below $65 in a few months time. Unless the country goes into a full lockdown, goods still need to be transported around and therefore locos still need maintenance work. Not to mention that their UK operations may be resuming soon, they've got a bunch of carriages to refurbish for the next 2-3 years.  What is also interesting is a bunch of directors awarding shares on 5/15.  No options because I'm in Kangarooland and the only zero brokerage site here doesn't do options trading.

Not a lot of money to be made going in any one direction in the mid term. Have to follow the trends but get in before the reversal. Have to profit on market emotions.

rcgbdd|gnu61u|gnu61u|4|Stop and think about this for a second and then get back to me.  Is retail prone to panic selling? The amount of diamond hands idiots here (self included) in the face of losing positions  makes me think that retail might not be so prone to panic selling as we're led to believe. The waterfall selling in March was caused by massive funds liquidating their positions to generate cash, which is why most of the movement tended to happen overnight (so many limit down mornings and then rocket rides all day).  The point of the question is that if big players are gonna dump on retail and leave them bagholding, how will that play out? A big, rapid decline (big players and retail rushing for exits)? A series of big moves down followed by slower rallies (big players dumping and retail buying the dip)? A slow steady bleed downwards (big players buying the dip as retail sells)?|2020-05-21 09:33:13

rbwtcq|gnu61u|gnu61u|2|New York Fed is privately-owned by some of the largest, most dangerous banks in America which, since 2008, have been habitually propped up by cheap money from the New York Fed. Those mega banks include JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  If the New York Fed is privately owned by the member banks in its region and has run up a $3.9 trillion balance sheet, its share owners should be on the hook for its liabilities, correct?  The mega banks that own the New York Fed are only responsible for $42.6 billion of its liabilities, despite the fact that those liabilities total $3.9 trillion.  That means taxpayers are on the hook for 98% of the Fed's $7T balance sheet.  Fuck the greedy big banks.|2020-05-21 05:46:31

The end of Summer will be tricky when the virus probably bears down on us again. People will be unwilling to return to the lockdown (which has already scarred many of us), especially in the midst a toxic political environment. So I worry we'll have a catastrophic October in terms of people falling ill.  And at that point it would probably be impossible to keep the market up even artificially.|2020-05-21 12:19:58

rd3xhb|gnu61u|gnu61u|1|   BABA set for 10%-20% jump in the next 2 weeks for the following reasons:  * Earnings will be good. More importantly guidance is going to be stellar with their new investments in cloud and AI * They are compliant and have an entity in HK. Company is audited by PwC and they will restore confidence in the earnings call on this. Senate said they will delist 'certain' companies, not all, and Alibaba is probably the most reliable Chinese stock out there * The fair value of BABA is $258 and is currently trading at $210.

rcgl6n|gnu61u|gnu61u|-7|Downvote me all you want for talking about politics, I just can’t find a good thread to talk about this without being removed for “political talk” shit may even happen here idk.   I think Covid is highlighting the issues in both socialism and capitalism.   There was a news article where I live that people aren’t going back to work because they’re making more on UI. This will catch up and eventually they won’t be able to collect if they keep refusing work, but with the backlogs right now, there’s no way we could keep track of this. At least for awhile. Highlighting the issues of social programs, you will always have people who jump at the first chance to abuse the system.   The fact that so many people can make more on social programs highlights the issues of capitalism. Covid is bringing to light how necessary it is for a middle ground, IMO|2020-05-21 09:35:38

rcvlhi|gnu61u|gnu61u|-6|Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.|2020-05-21 11:40:33
