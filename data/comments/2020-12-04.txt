These are likely people who've loaded up, then pushed the DD to pump their positions.  It's especially suspect if the account is new, or hasn't posted much, if at all.  One day we'll hear about firms having people on the floor who're ("whore", hur dur) tasked with posting DD here after they've entered positions.

Illumina tried to buy PACB but got slapped with antitrust and had to terminate the deal. Illumina then shit their pants and spent 8 billion to acquire a liquid biopsy company, which may just be vaporwave.  PACB just got a new team to lead it. The CEO wants to take on Illumina and is forming scientific collaborations with hospitals and labs to apply their technology to answer longstanding questions about the origins of epilepsy and intellectual disability, which I know is of utmost importance to most readers on this sub.  This is technology and a company you can feel good about investing in.   PACB market cap -> 3.5B Illumina market cap ->50.5B   This is an industry with massive growth and potential. That’s why PACB is ARKG’s third largest holding.  TLDR: PACB 6/18 30c or buy shares and enjoy the ride.|2020-12-04 08:36:02

Weed stonks are going to drop after the pop in anticipation of not passing the senate, but because of Chump's prattling on about rigged elections, Georgia's senate seats could end up flipping blue in the upcoming votes. If both of them flip, this will make the senate a straight 50/50 split and it'll for all practical purposes be a Democratic senate.  Sell your current positions at their highs and watch the Georgia senate races. If it looks like the Dems are going to take both seats, buy back in to weed stonks at their new lows.|2020-12-04 10:43:48

Holding $7 & 8 calls for next week, and $7, 8, and 9 calls for the week after.   Also, if anyone is bored and wants to see a funny chart, check out FOLD, a stock that's basically wholly owned by institutions.  It crashed yesterday after the algos picked up that the CEO sold a whopping 7500 shares and another exec sold 25k shares.

em0j1o|k6j06n|k6j06n|4|Well ya see, WSB, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.  "In much the same way, the economy can only operate as fast as the slowest workers. COVID, as we know, kills people. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest of society.  In this way, regular hospitalization of old people eliminates the weaker workers, making the economy a faster and more efficient machine. That's why you always feel richer after a few hundred thousand fatalities."|2020-12-04 10:55:21

emfvui|k6j06n|k6j06n|4|Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

em5f4i|k6j06n|k6j06n|2|Looking for help understanding this PLAY option that is ITM:  April 16 '21 $17.50 Call  > 1. If I have conviction that PLAY will continue to moderately increase in value until April 16, when is best to cash out? I understand 3 weeks ahead of expiry is a safe bet.  > 2. If PLAY stays at this price until April 16, my understanding is that the call option will slowly increase in value as volatility is reduced and the date of the option is nearer, except within a couple weeks of expiry when the option should be expected to lose value as it gets closer to expiration. Is this correct?  > 3. When would you sell this if it was you, and you had an expecation that PLAY will moderately increase in value, and you want minimal risk?|2020-12-04 11:34:05

Small number of clients still and lower contract value vs PLTR but not government and not consulting business. i.e actual fucking growth potential. They not only operate in same space but also face some of the same challenges, namely scaling down their product offering so it can address a broader market.  Initial investors include MSFT and Blackrock at IPO. Underwritten by Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan/BofA. Founder is Tom Siebel of Seibel fame (yes, that POS Oracle software but whatever).  IPO price if it actually lists at that will be about an 11x multiple of sales which is very reasonably priced.  Make no mistake this is a better buy than PLTR ever was.|2020-12-04 06:52:54

emfcwa|k6j06n|k6j06n|-19|TL;DR: Are any of you *actually* making money?  ---  Pretend like I'm a complete idiot.  I read this subreddit daily, because the banter and meme game is fucking outstanding, and because I'm amazed at how casually posters here post about gaining and losing *ridiculous* amounts of money. And I read about how this all essentially amounts to a casino, and like all casinos, the house always wins. I've never put money into these bets, because I know that I know little enough about all of this to the point that I'm more likely to lose money than gain money. My question is: is this casino game more like roulette, where you are statistically guaranteed to lose by playing long enough, or is it more like poker, where you can win more often than you lose by being a very sharp player, even if most players will lose?  Put another way, are there actually people playing these games with big-money options/calls/puts who actually make and *keep* reliable profits? Reliable in the sense that their gains outpace their losses over the long term... I am aware that the people posting their $1,000 -> $300,000 gains are not the sort of people I'm referring to here, because the type of YOLO, fuck-it-all risk behavior that can land absurd gains is the exact same risk behavior that eventually lands them back on $0. Going all-in at the poker table works until it doesn't. So, I'm not talking about those types. But what I'm wondering about is if there are people here who actually *do* make (and ultimately keep) big gains because of having a high risk tolerance while also being truly skilled at these big bets and understanding the markets? Maybe they lose big sometimes, but their wins are larger and/or more frequent than their losses, so they have a net positive?  I ask this because I feel like intuitively there can't be anyone posting their substantial gains here who are destined to keep those gains in the long term. The risk tolerance you have to have in order to substantially outpace much safer investment options inherently feels like it must, by necessity, bring your likeliness of succeeding to less than 50% (i.e., being subjected to "the house" having an advantage over you) when observing over a long enough timeframe. And I feel like that has to be an obvious observation, because the nature of these bets and their large gains inherently *must* have considerably more losers than winners, because the inverse of that, where more people win these big bets than lose, is mathematically impossible in a zero-sum environment. And I know that these things aren't automatically zero-sum, since Palantir or Gamestop could simply be adding considerable value to their company. But generally, there's obviously no way that the majority of people who place these large bets for against a company's success can walk away a big-time winner, meaning that there has to be more losers than winners. The guy winning 500% on a single bet is the result of someone losing substantially, and I assume the loser of that bet is almost always going to be more than one person.  If it is the case that there are required to be more losers than winners, that means, again, "the house" has a guaranteed mathematical advantage and this is just a roulette wheel that is statistically guaranteed to cost you more money than you'll earn if you play long enough. No one is skilled at roulette, they're only lucky. But the part that gives me pause is that roulette is literally just calling a number and hoping for the best. This "casino game" is vastly more complex, because (at least in theory) someone with a substantially stronger understanding of the game and all of its mechanics, a very sharp eye for patterns and the follies of other players' behaviors, an obsessive amount of attention to the news and earnings reports, etc., could play the game much better than other players, leading to a statistical edge over the other players... and overtaking the house advantage? That's really where my question is: do those exceptionally skilled "players" really exist in this investing casino game who have an actual edge over the house in the long run (even if it's a marginal edge), or is even the sharpest investor placing these risky bets guaranteed to lose by playing long enough? I feel like the obvious answer is, no, even the best investor is not going to give themselves enough of an edge to win more of these high-risk, high-reward bets. But I am curious to know if there are exceptions to this.|2020-12-04 12:52:17

I place an option buy order and set the price to market (because determining the price in TDA is impossible) and it executes 10% higher than actual market price. A few seconds later I place a buy with the limit price and it comes in 10-15% lower.      FUCK TDA|2020-12-04 07:34:30
