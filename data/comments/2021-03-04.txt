Wait for a correction/“dip”, for example like the one we are all suffering through. 2.	Buy options for cheap on real companies that are actually successful and growing over time, not P&D garbage or whatever random ticker is shorted. 3.	Catalyst (for example, JPow speaking in 90 min). 4.	Stock goes up.

pogebh|lxi05e|lxi05e|13|Typical overreaction/misunderstanding.  People falsely believed Powell was going to use a Wall Street Journal interview to announce the next "twist" was coming. So that was just a false expectation.  What Powell said wasn't different from what he's been saying all this time. He expects a temporary surge of inflation due to reopening (which is a good thing), but he's not seeing a trend that breaks from the expectation of average inflation of 2% a year over a period of many years.  Also reiterated that the Fed is continuing to buy bonds and is prepared to step up bond purchases if things get disorderly.|2021-03-04 12:11:27

Even in this crappy market they are day by day going up and up as more people realize their solid numbers. For those wondering what Q4 figures will look like, I think it will be very positive (I think they release those figures in April, so the majority of my calls are for April to allow time for that to be reflected in the price). I think we see sometime soon easily $35 and likely even $45 (if not higher).|2021-03-04 11:48:44

pony3p|lxi05e|lxi05e|17|For those of you nervous, or scared, or thinking you're losing everything.. breathe. Do not sell. This is perfectly normal after weeks of all time highs. These quick sell offs are healthy and a good opportunity to buy a few extra shares of what you like.   If we lost .5%- 1% a week for 4 months, THAT would be bad news. A sharp selloff is designed to do one thing: scare you into dumping at a loss.   IDC if the market tanks 6% more next week. The rebound will be swift and powerful. The 10-year yield will flatten, then recede. Stocks will not regain ATH right away, but watch them "staircase up" over the next several months. All normal. Options will be tough to play. Theta gang loves slow and steady.. but holding shares will not let you down this year, or next year. Stay the course.   I've played this game a while. If you are new, and scared, believe me I've been there. You'll be okay.|2021-03-04 13:04:07

Feels like Google will lead the way in 2021 and hit ATHs very fast whenever tech starts to recover from this pullback.

pn4tur|lxi05e|lxi05e|9|I know I'm not among the biggest 🦍 in here with my 45 @ $151.64 and that won't change but since I found some leftover money I wanted to let you know that I love this stock so much that I'm going to buy for another €1,000 at market open today.     I'm working on my 💎 🙌  and will likely sell one share at $10k to secure some extra profit and for the rest, my profit target is $100k per share.   (I have to admit that I used to be 📄 🙌  and already took profits before so my current holdings "only" contain €2,000 of my own money and are therefore still in profit + the €1,000 I'm adding today).     Last but not least, if this 🚀 doesn't take off in the next 10 days I'll likely buy for another €1,000 since I'm not a full 🦍 and only invest money I can afford to lose.|2021-03-04 05:28:09

What new calamity will we face tomorrow? This year has brought many unforeseen challenges to myself and others spiritually, emotionally, and physically. I’m afraid that life will get worse. I’m afraid that I have nothing to hope in anymore. Please help me to maintain my trust in you. Please help me to remember all the ways you have supported me throughout my life up until this point. Help me to not forget all that you have done. Lord, you are my refuge. Your love does not change even when my circumstances do. Help me to not forget...I can trust in you always.

A report from the GAO found that the move could be expected to raise $25bn in revenue in the first year with President Biden promising to be one of the first subscribers, saying in a statement: “you know I’ve always wanted to get a look at Nancy’s hangers - this would be a big step in realizing that dream.”  Markets traded flat today on the news - with many traders fleeing from their desks to vomit in the trading floor bathrooms.

poyi7a|lxi05e|lxi05e|7|The greater market sell off is because the stock market is filled with crap companies floating on cheap money. I talked to an AAL exec over the summer and asked: “How is American still solvent??” They responded: “It’s not, but we don’t have any major debt repayments coming up.” The reality is the entire economy is in the tank. Sometimes we forget that we still have the highest unemployment ever and there has been trillions of dollars in damage. Supply is down across the board. The environment is naturally highly deflationary. This has been covered up by immense amounts of cheap money. Money is getting more expensive and this fake 2020 bubble/rally is coming to an end.|2021-03-04 14:16:50

He was far from stable and things were super volatile at times.  What I'm trying to tell you is calm the fuck down and buy the shit out of this dip, because back then things felt a bit apocalyptic and every talking head was screaming to sell every AMZN because of deregulation, or a possible WW3 between US and China.

Jpow under Trump would have made absolutely clear today that they will not raise interest rates until a couple of years.

pp15nr|lxi05e|lxi05e|16|Here is how to implement this strategy for intraday traders.   Step 1. Choose a stock that you want to buy  Step 2. Buy in multiples of 100s, but buy minimum 200  Step 3. Buy when the index is low  Step 4. Hold till the stock goes up  Step 5. Then sell 1 call option of your choice of expiry and premium  (at this time, you have 100 stocks that you can whenever you want, another 100 stocks margined for your call option.   Step 6.  When the stock price comes down, your call option will be in profit.  Liquidate the call for profit.  Same time, since the stock price has come down buy the stock that you have sold in step 5.   or  Step 7. When stock price goes up, your 100 stocks will be in profit, sell them.  The other 100 stocks are margined for call option you can't sell them.    &#x200B;  This way, with just 200 stocks of any company, you can make money both ways, when market goes up also and down also.   &#x200B;  If you liked this strategy, please upvote.|2021-03-04 14:35:32

pngumy|lxi05e|lxi05e|8|UWMC FYI's:  Long term is future is really not good for them tbh.  They earned less than 1% on every mortgage while RKT earns 5%.  RKT had to cut margins due to declining volume and are now under 3%.  So if UWM had similar margin compression over the last 3 weeks, then they are earning less than .5% of a loan.  They also do not design their own tech or website, and therefore are subject to outsourcing for technology   Mortgage volume is down 50% to 60% and rates are back in the 3's.  This makes more companies competitive and reduces industry turn time, eliminating their only advantage [speed] and emphasizing their weakness [worst pricing in the wholesale mortgage space]  Short term, UWM is likely going to have layoffs this year, and probably around a 30-40% decline in profit.  --> mortgage industry consulting   Disclaimer: I work with LDI, RKT, UWMC, WFC, C, JPM on mortgage origination|2021-03-04 07:44:28

The tech sector is getting shorted to fuck by Boomer Hedge Funds who don't think that the tech market should be rapidly growing and expanding. I would bet my bottom dollar that most think this is similar to the tech bubble burst where investors were too early to the game. Fortunately for us, its not and tech is rapidly developing in months time and not years.   The last few weeks have absolutely sucked - trust me. I started investing small with 2k and was over 17k before the last couple of weeks. I've watched my portfolio fall to under 8k and it hurts.   Monthly saving rates are up, wages are rising, and expendable income is rising. We are in for a massive economic recovery with covid coming to a close.

pnisus|lxi05e|lxi05e|2|Why Quidel is undervalued. At around 150$ a share, quidel has a market cap of 6.42 billion dollars. Revenues from last quarter alone were 809 million with a gross profit of 701 million from the quarter. What a profit margin, amirite? EPS of 10.78 giving them current P/E ratio of 8.16. They have large contracts to sell their C19 tests for the next 3 years according to CEO Doug Bryant in the most recent earnings call. They are projected to have another big quarter as well. The sentiment from wallstreet is that coronavirus is a thing of the past. That is false according to leading infectious disease specialists and most health care professionals. The new variants will continue to circulate the globe for the forseeable future. The vaccines will not eradicate covid. Not financial advice. Not financial advisor.

Then I saw a meme on “thepack” subreddit about cranking HOGs and all that. And I thought “huh. Let me check it out”. They plummeted after their last ER, but they said they had a turn around plan. So I just YOLO’d into March 19 34c. And then it went up over 200%. And I’m like “damn that’s great”. Sold and started following the meme trends. Got up to 60k, and now after the past week, down to 15k. I thought “where do I go now?... Back to HOG” Take me to the promised land HOG.   8/20 35c HOG|2021-03-04 11:19:49

powxc0|lxi05e|lxi05e|9|OK, yes this week is gut wrenching to watch our portfolios tank with the market, but I do believe this is THE dip, and that the market will boom by end of month for these reasons, almost entirely based on optimism:  1. Pandemic uncertainty will diminish as we see case counts go down and vaccinations go up. Remember also that we had a totally expected huge virus boom in January due to Thanksgiving-Christmas holiday gatherings, and that's going down already. (btw... RIP to all those we lost and WSB hugs to their families) 2. The weather is getting warmer, and everyone gets more cheerful, going out, playing music from their cars, and SPENDING, both time and money. Here in the northeast we're gonna get to 60°F by mid next week, Texas will recover from their storms and the snowbirds will migrate back from Florida. People will feel happier and wallets will open. 3. Sports coming back. Not just local/national sports but the Olympics will be the talk of the town as it was moved from last summer to this summer. Even businesses tangential  or unrelated to sports benefit from this. Bars/restaurants near stadiums, road trips, anything accommodating people reconnecting with one another, etc. 4. Next Saturday 03/14 is daylight saving time shift, giving us one more hour of sunlight later in the day. Don't underestimate the positive effect this has on people, namely consumers.  I'm viewing the current market as one full of fire sales, so I'm all in. GG and stay safe my peeps.|2021-03-04 14:05:38

pn3ftw|lxi05e|lxi05e|15| **AMC related post - if you aren't interested please scroll past. All AMC 🦍 please read**    Repost from Yahoo Finance   \-------AMC UPDATE----------   WHY I LOOK AT TODAY (03.03.2021) AS A VICTORY!!   As far as I understand it, hedge funds failed to cover last Fridays shares today because they couldn't afford to drive the price up before more options expire this Friday. Remember their interest as of now is at 9%   This losing cycle and interest percentage hike will continue as long as we buy and hold and we keep taking out options contracts! This could take a few more weeks but we are gaining some serious momentum.   (don't get into options unless you understand them)     I also want to say to those that keep saying "its a new excuse every week" or "you guys always always say something will make the price go up"     here is my answer, we have been correct on our predictions and analysis this whole time, it is the hedge funds failing to deliver time and time again making it all AMC predictions and analysis look goofy. That is exactly what they want you to think, hoping you'll sell your shares.     We need to close above $10 at the end of the week to meet the 158,654 expiring options Friday. That will keep us stair stepping to the squeeze!!     Its as simple as holding and buying my friends     (PLEASE GET THIS TO THE TOP OR REPOST THAT WE NEED TO CLOSE ABOVE $10 ON FRIDAY)   &#x200B;  Love u **🦍🦍🦍**|2021-03-04 05:07:45

AppHarvest with a 52w high of $43ish. Sitting at $21/share.  I’m pointing out these 52 week highs because I feel like these stocks have dropped just due to the market.

We are 6X that currently...even a sell to 200 would be 3X larger than the lows of '09. So yeah, prepare yourselves. This shit is coming and it's going to obliterate a lot of people.

po5sn7|lxi05e|lxi05e|4|There is nothing that keeps each individual investor from immediate insolvency, but the mere pleasure of JPOW. By the mere pleasure of JPOW, I mean his soveriegn pleasure, independent of political pressures, and imbued by the rightous and all-powerful fed, his arbitrary will, restrained by no obligation, hindered by no difficulty any more than his own mere will. He hath no hand in preservation of your solvency, yet even for one additional moment, more than his pleasure affords.  And JPOW hates your puts.  He hates them. Your bearishness makes your portfolio heavy, weighs it down as if your positions were made of lead. As if they want to fall to zero, further even, such that your brokerage margin calls you in great sums, liquidates your positions, puts liens against your assets, as if you've been foolish enough to sell naked calls.  The hands of men cannot be strong, their portfolios cannot persist, when JPOW rises up.  The best hedged cannot defy him, nor any coconspirators deliver you from his wrath.  There is no fortress that is defense from the awesome and limitless power of the fed. Not bonds nor futures nor selling calls can shield you from his rightous anger.  And JPOW will rise up!  In great fury and rightious anger! When bears exit their caves and awake from under bridges, to shuffle and sniff about the markets.  Your bearish positions sit in the hand of an infinite, furious JPOW, who holds them above the fires of insolvency. Your bear positions. He holds them in his hand, with great contempt, without pity or remorse, without humanity but with fierce indignation.  Scorn! Provocation! Insolence! Disdain! You who have shown him arrogance through bear positions.  The infinite JPOW who hath delivered you from pandemic collapse, and yet, and yet, you hope to defy him.   JPOW will be so far removed from pitying you in your doleful case, or showing you the least reward or favor, and instead he will only tread on you beneath his boot.  He will crush you without mercy.  He will not only hate you, but he will have you in the uttermost contempt, no place shall be fit for you but under his feet, to be trodden down in the mire of the Street. He shall cast your puts into the fires below. Fuck your puts!  Brrrrrrrtt!  Fuck them! Fuck your bonds.  They are nothing. Rabidly, vehemently, violently, fuck your puts!|2021-03-04 10:55:54

pniezm|lxi05e|lxi05e|2|Who is watching and betting on Vroom $VR ?  Carvana lost $.87 a share when the market expected a loss of $.47. For some reason analysts love Carvana. Morgan Stanley projected in Carvana could go up 60%.  Carvana's marketcap is roughly 9 times greater than Vroom. Carvana's revenue is only 5 times greater Vroom. Based on revenue, Vroom's marketcap should be 1/5 of Carvana. That would give Vroom a marketcap of over $10 billion. This translates to a share price of over $84. Looks like it’s a good buy under $40. Numbers met and guidance is in line. 80% revenue growth in 2021. Car Max is also doing well in post pandemic market. With the sharp dip this AM, I would expect a correction upwards before the end of next week. Definitely not going to the moon, but I think a correction of $5-$10 per share is within reason.   &#x200B;  I went ahead and bet $800 on it in PM to see if we get a jump.|2021-03-04 07:58:15

pne1ip|lxi05e|lxi05e|0|Guys some DD for UWMC:   Shorts could be majorly screwed tomorrow, their already on all the websites spreading their doom and gloom today trying to get a panic sell going. Don’t sell, first Monday is our dividend holdings date, so .40 a share on a $10 stock is crazy, should just hold because of that. We have the shorts scared. If we at least just hold your shares today into tomorrow we can win the week. Buy and holddd Even if you can only buy an extra 4 shares do it. If we can move this up today, get it rolling by the afternoon we could start a small short squeeze. All the ones who shorted it in the last week will have to buy in. That going into tomorrow where people will start to buy for the ex dividend date Monday could be an amazing 3-4 days, we could hit $15-$18 So please at least don’t sell, don’t let shorts take our money Spread the word this is a winner today!  Even their director announced in an SEC filing this morning that he's buying an additional 60,000 shares. Usually a good sign when insiders buy more shares but I don't know enough about the SEC filing to know if his Order has already been executed or today was just him announcing it.

REV - -Revlon has only a 6.8 million float (that's 1/10th of GME) and is shorted 28.7% at the most recent data I have access to. Currently trading at $12.02 with a really nice technical setup. Wouldn't take near the ammo expended on GME to send this thing to the moon. Could also be considered a reopening stock, since people who don't go out don't spend much on makeup, but once the offices, bars, and clubs are reopened the ladies (and some gentlemen I guess) will be applying the war paint with a paint roller once again.

po3k4n|lxi05e|lxi05e|1|pg&e and TSLA are building the worlds largest batter backup in moss landing california. Australia is trying to get 50% battery generated with TSLA, Care Sales in israel sold out in a few days, sold out in china after 10hrs, revenue 40% to 50% year over year. Cybertruck presales are higher compared to their car presales. EVS are only 2 to 3% of transpo. Even if TSLA loses market share , they will still have a huge chunk of that 97% leftover. going against this is nonsense. Giga Berlin and Giga China is gonna up net margins when they don’t have to transport all cars from US. SolarCity aspect of it is starting to dominate. When Earnings start to show from all of this, $650 price is gonna look cheap. don’t listen to me. Im just a TSLA bull. Bought more at $635  Ps.

poy05x|lxi05e|lxi05e|-1|Serious question. I bought stock when it was at $108 and now its up to $134, but my total investment hasn't gone up. In fact im actually at a small loss right now. Why is that? I'm new to this so please if possible be only a little mean  Edit: What im asking is if the price per share goes up does that mean what I invest is supposed to go up?  or when price per share goes up does that mean what I invest goes down? When I try to research this I'm not getting a straight or definite answer.|2021-03-04 14:13:17

We had them by surprise, good news and the price it was shorted at was too low as it hadnt gone this high before. Yet they still stopped it dead in its tracks. Now, the short interest is significantly lower and for all we know they couldve easily exited initials and shorted it at high 300s.

We had them by surprise, good news and the price it was shorted at was too low as it hadnt gone this high before. Yet they still stopped it dead in its tracks. Now, the short interest is way lower and for all we know they couldve easily exited initials and shorted it at high 300s. Theres no way a squeeze will happen when they are following this sub and are ready for it.|2021-03-04 05:23:13

When TSLA was approaching $1T and AAPL was at $2.5T it was clear that tech was out of control. So we still have a way to go, maybe 10% on SPY and NASDAQ before we start an amazing post-COVID rally. What I think I saw these past few weeks, and it’s the first time I think I’ve noticed it as it was happening, is MMs having successfully programmed retail to buy up all the dips. MMs dumped everything the last two weeks around SPY 285-290 and now dip buyers are out of cash. SPY will get to around 350 and if you buy there you are looking at a solid 15-20% this year if you go long and maybe 30% on QQQ.|2021-03-04 09:07:54

pnkyqa|lxi05e|lxi05e|-4|Let's Kill Those Shorts  "Go to your brokerage and place a limited sell order of all your shares at a very high price, e.g. 1000, to ensure the sell order will not go through. This will mark your share as for sell and be taken out of the pool that your broker can lend to short sellers. This will make the borrowing cost much higher even if they could still find shares to borrow."

pohdrg|lxi05e|lxi05e|-4|Just came across This article:     There isn’t any company-specific news driving Tanger’s stock price higher. But there’s still a good explanation for today’s move.  Tanger appears to be the latest target of the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, which fueled the massive short squeezes in companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) just a few weeks ago.  As of early Thursday morning, Tanger was the No. 1 trending stock in the WallStreetBets community. And it’s not hard to see why. Nearly 40% of Tanger’s float is currently sold short, making it the second-most-heavily shorted company in the market, just slightly behind GameStop itself.  Original Article:  [https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/04/skt-new-target-for-wallstreetbets/](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/04/skt-new-target-for-wallstreetbets/)  &#x200B;  Just focus on one stock retards!

Although they mainly reside in Canada they launched a test of their products in Colorado a few months ago. H EXO also just signed with CannMart for a national supplies agreement end of last month. IMO Hexo gonna smash upcoming earnings and show that they are erasing their cash burning by generating more revenue and will become more profitable in no time.
