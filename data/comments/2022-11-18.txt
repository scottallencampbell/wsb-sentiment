wumyex|yyhcio|yyhcio|35|I never regret selling something for profit. If I made 500 dollars on a trade and at the time, thought that was a good idea to sell it, then it keeps moving in my direction over the next few hours and would have been like a 5k win instead, for example.   Realistically, if you thought selling for 500 was good, then its pretty likely you would have sold for 600, or 750. So I don't think of it as losing out on 4500 gains, because at most it would have been a few hundred extra before I decided it was a good idea to sell. And in that time, its pretty easy for positions to reverse.   Take profits and never look back.|2022-11-18 08:05:11

wupx8s|yyhcio|yyhcio|11|CBOE equity put/call ratio highest since 1997.  Typically put/call ratios do tend to spike before major selloffs but there can be a multi-month lag between when the spike occurs and when the selloff takes place.  2008 for example, put/call ratio peaked in Feb-March but the real collapse in stocks was 8 months later.  I think bears are going to get squeezed hard for the next 2 months; piling puts against a hated rally that keeps grinding upward.  I would not bet against this rally until 2023.

What is the leading forward looking indicator of the economic cycle?  Yall know what it is.  And when that bottoms, the stock market historically has bottomed as well. Elementary financial concepts.

wu92t3|yyhcio|yyhcio|6|The whole “take 3 months severance or get ready to work overtime every day” move by Elon was pretty short sighted.   The people who are skilled/experienced enough to work anywhere will take the severance because the prospect of having to find another job doesn’t scare them. Meanwhile, the ones who are mediocre and barely hanging on will stay because they don’t trust their own skill set on the job market. Nobody’s gonna stay at Twitter because they’re “passionate” about his vision, it’s not SpaceX. His vision to make an “X” everything app is based on the most popular apps used under the CCP and that’s not a vision anyone should support anyway.|2022-11-18 05:52:52

I think the most cash I could possibly spend in a lifetime is like $10B, that would easily cover all the crazy shit like private islands and harems and planes.  After reaching that net worth, would you really care what happens with the excess? Yilong has over $200B **extra** to burn on trolling/memes. There's no way he cares about his boring old car company anymore, he's focused on impregnating his harem and playing videogames and dropping acid to dream about landing on Mars.  A founder/CEO/TechnoTwit/whatever that gets that unimaginably rich, has to be a liability. There's just no possible way they can give a single fuck anymore.|2022-11-18 09:19:14

He went to france alone a couple months ago and he met a girl there who he may have spent the night with… I’m not sure.  I asked abt him talkin to other chicks and he Deleted everything and lied abt it.  His role model is andrew Tate lol so kinda makes sense… Is it actually normal for guys in relationships to hit up other chicks for fun?  Should I tell him I looked thru his stuff and saw everything?|2022-11-18 12:37:49

wvrihb|yyhcio|yyhcio|-2|[OC](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/yy80fd/people_are_projecting_elon_musk_stfu_on_the/iwteiei/)  Posted in another thread in response to someone who said people just don’t like Elon because he’s a republican and that the apartheid thing was his ancestors. Sharing here because I genuinely want people to stop making these parasites heroes:   Elon musk is not a republican he simply does not want taxation, regulation, or a functioning government because that’s how billionaires are able to exist and thrive. He is not ideologically committed to anything, except putting one over on you and anyone else he can.  Elon is factually an Apartheid profiteer, that shit didn’t happen hundreds of years ago and extracting emeralds wealth from Africa on the backs of Africans is literally the base of wealth that made him a capitalist in the first place. He is not a capitalist in the sense that he “believes in free markets,” he is actually a capitalist - a guy who’s money makes money and who’s life and identity rests only on this.  His money got him into all of his successful adventures, not his ideas. And many insiders have said he was good at taking credit and shoving out others while not contributing much at PayPal and even Tesla.  His successful ventures grew heavily on ambitious, talented people, and government subsidies — carbon credits for Tesla and government contracts for space x. His personal projects and ideas are all vaporware or catastrophes - solar city, those rooftop solar panels, boring company, cybertruck, now Twitter.  The guy is an absolute narcissist. He exploits and abuses his employees in well documented ways while hoarding glory for himself. He is a market manipulator who pumps his own portfolio through Twitter by getting rubes to overvalue everything from dogecoin to tesla. He pretends to be a contrarian but he is frankly just a boring man who gets his personality from the most obnoxious margins of the internet.  He is also, above all, a purely cynical capitalist, rolling debt and headlines into wealth on paper and so on and so on to selfishly and pointlessly feed his ego.  I’ve met him, long before he was what he is now. I admired him at the time and had hopes that some of these people had principle’s but they have turned out to be extremely boring narcissists who cant do anything but take. We can build websites, electric cars, and even a better society without them, and we will be better off when they aren’t mythologized for simply being rich.|2022-11-18 12:46:07

wvdcpd|yyhcio|yyhcio|1|Rumor: AMZN & $NFLX are circling Michael Lewis' upcoming book on FTX & Sam Bankman-Fried. Lewis was embedded w/ SBF for 6 months & one plot point will focus on the rivalry with Binance’s Changpeng Zhao.    In August, Lewis hinted about his new book:    “I really don’t want to reveal exactly what I’m writing about. But I found a character through whom I can write about — it weirdly links up Flash Boys, The Big Short and Liar’s Poker."    “I guess it is possible it will be framed as a crypto book, but it won’t be a crypto book. It’ll be about this really unusual character. You’ll learn all about crypto and you’ll learn about what screwed up market structure in the United States and so on.”|2022-11-18 11:10:47

ww0bs0|yyhcio|yyhcio|-1|Reclassification in U.S. could be key    The bigger catalyst for the space, though, is the possible removal of a Schedule 1 classification, which would lift federal restrictions and enable the kind of growth opportunities early investors have envisioned, proponents say. President Biden’s move to review the Schedule 1 status has solidified expectations that cannabis will eventually be taken off the list of illicit narcotics.        But timelines are elusory and cannabis may not escape controlled-substance status altogether. It could instead be re-classified as a Schedule 2 substance in line with drugs like adderall and methadone. Drugs in that category can be legally sold but carry steep taxation requirements that the industry hopes it can lobby itself out of paying.        “If that goes away, then it’s a much better environment for operators,” Mr. Carter of Stifel says.        Meanwhile, the legal and political uncertainties combined with a challenging operating environment have led executives of major producers to temper near-term expectations. Announcements may momentarily stir the market but material developments remain in the future for now.|2022-11-18 13:46:28
