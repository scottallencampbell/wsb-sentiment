It‚Äôs not at all clear how this will really move the needle, much less get investors back into their bullish mood from last month. Probably the catalyst will have to come for elsewhere.

prsmzi|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|5|At important pivot points, there are stocks that stand out and typically lead the way out of pullbacks.  For tech, it's almost always been one of the mega caps the past decade+.  Right now, the megacap that's outperforming dramatically is GOOG.  Google is holding just a few percentage points off all time highs and was up yesterday even as  tech stocks were mostly down.  Usually the "leader" will bottom first and then hold strongly as the rest of tech bottoms; the question is whether GOOG will hold onto that $2000 bottom from Wed.  If GOOG holds above that through Monday, that's a pretty good sign that tech is at the bottom.  We saw similar behavior all through last year from AMZN, AAPL, MSFT at various points where one would outperform on pullbacks and then quickly hit new ATHs.  Looks like GOOG's turn to lead tech.|2021-03-05 07:45:01

Once stimulus passes Senate and markets feel comfortable that there's a hundred billion+ dollars that will enter the market from those stimulus checks, I don't see how we keep selling off.  Just spitballing, but there was a bunch of weeks last March where the market would sell late into Friday and then a 1% pump on Friday would turn into a 3-5% run the following week.  Wonder if that's sort of what might happen here.  I just don't see why markets would keep selling if the stimulus passes, that's like a giant BRRRRR airdrop here.|2021-03-05 08:45:28

pshwsr|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|6|Fear hasn‚Äôt set in yet. People are still buying dips. But in my opinions it‚Äôs honestly futile. Bond rates rising will crush any company that relies on debt to maintain operation (a LOT of tech companies operate this way). Also the jobs report shows we‚Äôre still below depression era unemployment, which means money velocity is low and banks will tighten credit standards, which is deflationary.

pskkh7|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|17|I'm old enough to remember people on WSB complaining in April and May 2020 about not buying LEAPS on good companies when market tanked and how that was "LitErAlLy fReE mOnEY" and a "oNcE iN a gEnEraTiON oPpoRtUnItY" missed.   So imagine my utter shock when the market presents a similar opportunity again in 2021 and yet the same people are not only not taking the opportunity to buy discounted leaps on said good companies, but instead, they're rather whining, moaning and even considering buying put options.   Full disclosure: I was one of those people last year but this time, I am buying leaps and long dated calls on good companies and ETFs. Sure I am bleeding heavily now but I have faith in these companies recovering and hitting ATH in a few months again.   You will never be able to perfectly time the bottom of a correction or crash. If you do, you simply got lucky. Rather than trying to time the bottom, just find good companies (not wsb meme companies  and SPAC) that have been hit unfairly by this sell-off and buy long dated options (please please please no weeklies. You'll get burned). They may keep bleeding for a while but once the recovery starts who cares whether you get a 8 to 10-bagger (buying now) or a 12-bagger (perfectly timing the bottom)? Don't be the guy who sits on the sidelines and miss a great opportunity.   Take care and good luck!|2021-03-05 11:18:19

pt0t5d|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|16|A lot of these fuckin youtubers and twitter finget analysts are trying to predict the market off charts alone.   Lets look at some of the reasons why the market is really tanking right now..  Alot of people lost their jobs and are old enough to retire/need the money for rent or whatever, so everyone pulling out of their 401k's leaving the retail investors the bags. Boomers at the moment cant afford the market to tank even more because of the uncertainty of the job market post covid.  Fed still deciding if they want extend bank capital reserve exemptions, Banks will go buy bonds and bring yields down . It is highly likely the 1.9T stimulus might be priced in  But for now, I dont see any turnaround soon. The suits are still anticipating inflation is here to stay , so they are still doubling down their positions. They are shorting almost every ETF as stated in the DD article posted a few days ago.  Look if you need the money, get out now. If you are in for the long haul ~2 years, you will be fine. But I think the bears are going to win the rest of the next couple months.  My gameplan, get rid of all OTM near expiry calls, for everything else my wifes boyfriend change my Fidelity password for now, and check in next year  Time in the market is better than timing the market.|2021-03-05 13:16:26

The market has spoken, soon the light of the last smartphone will be extinguished, the last website will go offline and Amazon will release its slaves to freedom with its demise. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Tim Apple will walk arm in arm into the sunset.  There will be much poverty, hunger and suffering. The streets once filled with children's laughter will now be characterized by gloomy figures and long lines in front of soup kitchens.  Of course, soup kitchen queues, food distribution and emergency aid will also have to be organized. What could be better suited for this than Palantir?

psv9wj|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|7|Man, as someone who thought he was smart to diversify and invest in some actual non-meme stocks, this week has been a disaster. I jumped on Rocket while it was just at $24, saw it rise over 70% the next day and then saw it all crash again the next day, yet it's still the only stock I'm overall in the green for. The only other stocks to not go deeper in the red this week are my other degenerate meme stock investments, AMC and GameStop, although I'm still more than 50% in the red for each after I bought in on February 1st, so it's no big solace really. Everything else in my portfolio, from AMD to Corsair to GNP is down 20% or more, and overall I'm down more than 35% since I started investing. A rough first month lol.  I know really should start figuring out how the fuck I *sell* stocks instead of just buying them. I still believe stuff like AMD and Corsair will be worth twice what they are now, so I could try to average out I guess, but I just want to see some positive results on *something* soon.|2021-03-05 12:35:17

psi00r|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|7|Guys, there is little reason to invest in anything other than GME. The rest of the market is tanking, they‚Äôre not unrelated. I almost bought some dips Wednesday and here we are today and they‚Äôve dropped lower, I would‚Äôve lost money. This could last weeks, you will have a couple of green days, but nothing is going to market-correct until the dust settles from the GME shit-storm. So, either buy in, or hold your money until things turn around.  Not financial advice, simply sharing an opinion of what I guess is happening|2021-03-05 10:59:46

prih23|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|8|TO G-M-E and A-M-C brethren - don't dislike my comment just cause it is not your confirmation bias, but please, just read below:  You guys really don't know how gamma squeezes work do you? Keep saying the same thing every fucking week despite being proven wrong over and over and over. Gamma squeezes happen when the market makers hedge options PURCHARSES not on option expiration. "We need to close above $10" No we don't. Options expiring in the money doesn't trigger anything. Stop repeating this bullshit nonsense, it only "creates" an expiration date and it's always "tomorrow will be big". Just stop, you are putting people in expectancy loopholes and they get stuck in it. What is happening now is basically the period of hold, nothing triggers anything here, you are currently holding the bag, but just not in deep shits as you used to. UNTIL something ACTUALLY happens with the company and big news DRIVE price movement.  EDIT: because I read these posts on top of the sub and I see people just google'd "gamma squeeze" and read it for the first time. This is delusional and huge misinformation without any context and/or practice.|2021-03-05 05:52:24

ps6o7a|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|5|Cathie thinking she shouldn't have bought speculative stocks right now. All the ARK funds were trading sideways for many years until this year hit where the market fell into a speculative mania where people were throwing money at companies with little to no revenue but valuations of literally billions of dollars. ARK benefited the most from this speculative market we've been in, but nothing lasts forever, people are realizing that these speculative investments don't make much sense and thesese crazy valuations are being questioned, so money is going back to stocks that actually have value and actually have good earnings reports. Cathie and ARK will suffer the most now that money is going back to real companies that have real value today. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook are barely being hit by this correction. As the correction continues, they will go down too, but not close to the speculative stocks that will be hit the hardest.|2021-03-05 09:38:30

They exceeded expectations and went from like $58 to almost $70. I'm like, whelp that option is expiring worthless that's what I get for being a retard.   Wake up today, the morning of expiry date and it's tanking. I'm halfway to making it all back, it keeps going down. Next thing I know I'm up $80+ per contract, hyped af, texting my friends how lucky I am that are also new to investing, and within literal minutes the stock starts rocketing back up. Luckily I didn't try to stick it out and hope it goes back down. Sold at 1.70 per share, I bought at 2.77 per share, and I failed to sell at 3.14 (lol pie) because I was greedy.      Take your profits, don't be a retard like me. Unless you know what you're doing of course, but isn't that why we're here?|2021-03-05 13:37:51

psc24a|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|0|let me explain something to you retards. i'm Canadian and when a noob investor asks non-retards what to invest in, they say just throw it into VGRO.TO.  It's an ETF with 80% stocks, 20% bonds... and the stocks are globally diversified. it's an easy all in one solution for someone who doesn't want to build their own portfolio of ETFs or make any specific bets.   it's currently trading at $29.11 ... and its all time high was on Feb. 16th, 2021 at $30.40.  so this thing is less than 5% off its all time high. that's what normal investors are holding, and they haven't even noticed this downturn because their shit is barely down.   so if you're wondering when will the pain stop... the pain hasn't even started yet. it's just bubble tech stocks and speculative assets that are crashing. normal stocks have barely moved. when everything starts crashing, there is a long way down to go... so this correction might only just be getting started.|2021-03-05 10:17:28

psz124|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|-8| Modes keep deleting my posting, so let's see if I have better luck here.   Robin-crooked-hood is incorrectly reporting my Short-term capital losses as wash sales to IRS. Hoping if someone here is experencing same issue? Here is what happened:  * I bought AirBnb on December 10th 2020 for avg price of $155 (2 transactions) * I sold AirbnB on same day December 10th 2020 for avg price of avg price of $146 (2 transactions) * I incurred $10 loss per share * I waited 33 days and then rebought AirBnb  On my 1099 this trade is being reported as wash sale instead of \~$2000 short term capital loss. Their support team is telling me because I bought and sold on same day that triggers a wash-sale. However, according to IRS rules, wash-sale only applies if I sell for a loss and then rebuy again within 30 calendar days [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/wash-sales-rules-tax](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/wash-sales-rules-tax)  Just wondering if anyone experienced same issue?|2021-03-05 13:02:55

psicuf|ly9gxp|ly9gxp|-1|Hey WSB, teach me something?     I want to set up an automatic sell order but I must have the terminology wrong for what I want to do because I don't see it as an option.  &#x200B;  I only want the automatic sale to be triggered if the sale price will be above my average cost by a set amount. I also want the trailing aspect where it will allow it to continue to increase prior to selling on it's way back down.   &#x200B;  Ex: I'm in a stock with 10 shares at $135.00 cost. I don't want to set an order with the possibility that it sells below 135.00, in that case I'd rather hold. Let's say I want it to get up to 175.00 before anything is triggered and at that point it can continue to gain, but will sell if it drops 15% from highest point after achieving that gain.   &#x200B;  So it climbs to 175 and the trigger is hit, continues to climb to 195, then drops to 169.57 where it triggers the sale. Or, keeps on going to the moon and triggers a sale much higher number on the way back down. Or, if it hits 176 and comes down it sells in the 140's.   &#x200B;  Is that an order type that exists? Or am I better off just picking a number for a limit sell (or better off doing something entirely different)?|2021-03-05 11:02:21
